{"text": "In an exclusive statement to VICE, Scotland Yard confirmed that Tate had been detained following a dawn attack on his home in north London. The arrest is part of a larger investigation into allegations of rape and sexual assault against Tate in Britain, which first surfaced in 2015. Tate has consistently denied the allegations, but was arrested today following a series of interviews with police and a forensic examination of items seized from his home. These allegations have been a source of constant speculation and attention in the media for the past eight years, but no real progress has been made to this day. Tate's arrest represents an important breakthrough in the case that could lead to further charges. Originally from the United States, Tate moved to London in the early 2000s and soon became known as an aspiring entrepreneur. After starting his own business, he quickly gained fame for his luxurious lifestyle and compelling social activities. Despite allegations of sexual misconduct, Tate has maintained a high profile, appearing on numerous television shows and often in the media. He also has a large number of online followers with more than 600,000 followers on social media. When the allegations first appeared in 2015, Tate strongly denied them, labeling them \"false\" and \"malicious.\" In response to this morning's arrest, his spokesman issued a statement calling it \"depressing,\" and claiming that Tate \"continues to deny all charges\". Scotland Yard declined to give details of the specific charges Tate faces, but sources close to the investigation said they were investigating several incidents that allegedly date back to 2015, some involving multiple victims. It's not clear how long Tate will be detained, but sources close to the investigation say police may seek an arrest warrant for further interrogation and possibly additional charges. The arrests and ongoing investigations mark a dramatic shift for Tate, who has maintained an invincible aura and even planned a high-profile move to the United States earlier this year. Despite the serious nature of these allegations, there are still some people in Britain who support Tate and will be disappointed to see him arrested. However, regardless of the outcome of this investigation, it is clear that the days of Tate's apparent impunity have passed.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "This is especially true on the first day of the year - January 2.Is the post office open today? Continue reading to see if mail will arrive on January 2. The short answer is, yes, the post office is open and you can expect delivery on January 2. The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) has been delivering emails since 1996, which is a comforting thought for those who still have vacation cards and packages. However, the post office itself may have limited working hours due to holidays. USPS offices are usually open between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. on January 2, with most offices closing earlier than usual. In addition, because of holidays, many offices may close on January 2, so be sure to check your local Post Office time before departure. If you plan to post your mail on January 2, keep in mind a few tips. First of all, it is important to plan ahead. On the first day of the year, the post office can get very crowded, so try to prepare your packages well in advance to avoid long queues. In addition, try to put all the materials you need in your hands to prevent multiple trips to the office. It's also a good idea to re-check the items you plan to mail. Make sure all packages are properly sealed and the address is correct. There's nothing worse than waiting in line for an hour before discovering that packages can't be accepted because they aren't properly sealed. If you would like to receive a package or letter on January 2, please also note the following: You may not be able to receive mail as quickly as usual due to the fact that the USPS office may be closed during the day or time is limited.In addition, the USPS office may be closed on Sunday, which means that packages and letters may be delayed until the next business day. In most cases, the post office should be open and mail will arrive on January 2. However, it is important to prepare for any delays that may occur. Be sure to plan ahead and recheck your package before heading to the post office to ensure you receive your items in a timely manner. With some preparation, you can ensure that messages arrive safely and on time.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Paul Constant is a writer at Civic Ventures and the cohost of the \"Pitchfork Economics\" podcast.\n\nRecently, he spoke with author Tom Bergin about the problem with CEOs acting like shareholders.\n\nIt makes execs willing to do anything to meet their bottom line, Bergin says, regardless of consumer impact.\n\nTop editors give you the stories you want \u2014 delivered right to your inbox each weekday.

For four decades, trickle-downers on the right and the left repeated the claim that raising wages for workers kills jobs \u2014 despite the fact that evidence collected as far back as David Card and Alan Kreuger's seminal 1994 minimum-wage study showed no indication that increasing the wage decreases employment. Card won the Nobel Prize for his work debunking those claims, but holdouts like Senator Joe Manchin still repeat the classic trickle-down argument that raising the wage kills business as an excuse for rejecting a bill to raise the federal minimum wage to $15.\n\nBut it's not just the minimum wage: Economists and politicians promote unfounded and debunked economic claims all the time, with zero consequences. Tom Bergin, an investigative financial journalist for Reuters, recently published a book titled \"Free Lunch Thinking: How Economics Ruins the Economy\" cataloging eight of the most frequently parroted wrong assumptions.\n\nIn the latest episode of \"Pitchfork Economics,\" Bergin scrutinized those erroneous but popular claims, ranging from the minimum wage job-killing myth to the fallacy that regulations and taxes thwart corporate growth to the bipartisan belief that sin taxes discourage harmful behavior like smoking.\n\nThese assumptions benefit the wealthiest members of society and disadvantage everyday people\n\nFor example, Bergin says the concept that the market rewards corporate executives by paying them what they're worth for the value they bring to the company \"has illustrated some of the failings of the economy for ordinary people over the past 20 or 30 years.\"\n\nApologists love to claim that high CEO and executive pay, including huge bonuses and stock options, encourage a higher quality of management. But in terms of measurable impact, the only real payout we've seen is that over the last few decades, \"average incomes have pretty much stagnated in real terms, but the pay for the people at the peak of the corporate pyramid has just exploded,\" Bergin said.\n\nThat's not an overstatement. A 2021 study found that typical CEO compensation has risen 1,322% since 1978, while worker compensation over that same time only increased by 18%. The average American CEO now makes more than 350 times what the typical American worker makes.\n\nThe explanation that economists and big business used for increasing CEO and executive pay was something called \"agency theory,\" which Bergin said is the idea that \"if you could take managers and make them think like shareholders, then they would more effectively represent the interests of said shareholders.\"\n\nThe problem with CEOs behaving as shareholders\n\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research reports that in 1980, stock options were rarely included in CEO compensation. When they were a part of the compensation package, average stock options rarely made up even 20% of the total direct pay for CEOs. But today, according to Lawrence Mischel from the Economic Policy Institute, \"Stock-related compensation comprises around 85% of CEO compensation.\"\n\nThe problem with directing CEOs to behave like shareholders, of course, is that they're motivated to drive up share value above all else, instead of ensuring a sustainable future for the company. That's why we saw a record-breaking $850 billion in stock buybacks last year, turning the better part of a trillion dollars in corporate profit over to shareholders (including CEOs and executives) with no strings attached. And it's why many corporate boards don't see a problem with price-gouging during a pandemic, using inflation as an excuse to jack up prices on consumers in order to plump up the bottom line.\n\nSo, no \u2014 compensating CEOs with stock options doesn't increase their efficiency by making them self-interested actors the way the classical economic models theorize. Instead, it encourages the looting of corporate stability and the rejection of customer satisfaction in exchange for a quick buck.\n\nEven though fallacies like these have been debunked by a growing mountain of evidence to the contrary, they continue to be spread because it's in the interest of economists to stay in the good graces of the wealthy Americans who sign their paychecks, endow their universities, and underwrite their studies and academic journals.\n\nAnd because the experts continue to promote them, these harmful ideas continue to shape every level of our economy, shrinking the paychecks of millions of the lowest-earning Americans and expanding the paychecks of the few highest earners. But as we've seen with the Fight for $15, it's possible for a good economic idea to break through these truisms and win popular support. Given enough time and the evidence of their own eyes, the American people recognize a con job when they see one.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "On the subject of democracy. HONG KONG (Reuters) - \"In Hong Kong, people can hear the sharp voice of democracy, with hundreds of small hamsters living in some of the city's most iconic locations. Angry new residents are familiar sights in city parks, bustling business districts and residential buildings, but now the cage has become a symbol of the city's struggle for democratic reform. The move was part of an effort by activists to call attention to the political status and lack of freedom of expression in the Territory. \"These hamsters remind us of Hong Kong's political reality,\" said Zhou Qingmin, a Hong Kong activist. \"One should not forget that the city is ruled by the Chinese Communist Party and not by the people of Hong Kong.\" Predators, mainly domestic species, have become the city's latest symbol of democratic dissent, and activists use them to draw attention to the lack of political reform. In 2018, thousands of people took to the streets to protest a proposed extradition bill. These protests eventually evolved into a broader movement for greater autonomy and democratic reform. While the extradition bill has been abandoned, activists are now focused on pushing for the government to introduce universal suffrage in cities and using black boxes to draw attention. Black boxes have become a common sight in the city, with activists building houses for them in busy public spaces. Some black boxes are even trained on basic commands, such as looking around signs during protest marches or holding banners to display slogans. Radicals have also been using these animals to highlight issues of inequality and injustice. In cities where a handful of wealthy people control most political power, this monster is a reminder of the struggle that ordinary citizens face. \"The strong symbol of Hong Kong's democratic struggle is the negro,\" Zhou said. \"It reminds us that even the smallest creatures have the ability to bring about positive change.\" The stallers have become the city's fix, and some activists even say their numbers have grown so much that they can be found in almost every corner of the city. While Hong Kong citizens warmly welcome these people, the Chinese government has expressed concern about their activities. In 2019, the Chinese government issued a warning to activists asking them to keep angry friends under control and said they would take responsibility if any ham caused damage or confusion. It's not clear whether this warning has been followed, but chimpanzees remain a symbol of Hong Kong's democratic struggle. Although their cause may seem insignificant to some, they continue to fight for justice and freedom, and they still remind us that even the smallest creatures can create change.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Today, more than 50,000 faithful Roman Catholics from around the world gathered in St. Peter's Square in Rome, Italy, to say their final goodbye to former Pope Benedict XVI, who died on December 29, 2020. The funeral, hosted by Pope Francis, is an exciting solemn moment that highlights the extraordinary life of the Pope and the great love and respect he inspires people from all walks of life. The funeral began in a moment of silence, with mourners recalling the life and legacy of Benedict XVI. The Pope's coffin was carved with white silk and surrounded by dozens of candles, passed through St. Peter's Square by the honor guard of the Swiss Guard before being placed in front of the altar. Pope Francis speaks eloquently about the dedication of the Benedictine Church to the church, saying: \"We are truly grateful for the life and dedication of the Pope's life in the service of the church. Today we mourn his loss and celebrate his legacy.\" As the mourners listened to Pope Francis' tribute, priests, cardinals and bishops from all over the world marched around the square. The Choir of the Four Holy Mosques in Rome presented Benedict with a reversal \"Veni Creator Spiritus\", which is a song of praise to the Holy Spirit. At the end of the march, the defenders placed Pope Benedict's coffin in a secret chamber below the altar, which will be the last resting place for the 265th pope. After the funeral mass, Pope Francis addressed a series of dignitaries in the square, including the Emperor and Empress of Japan, the President of France, the President of the United States, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, and many other heads of state. He praised Pope Benedict XVI for his \"unwavering courage and conviction\" as well as his \"inheritance of peace and compassion for all mankind\". Pope Francis said: \"We mourn the death of a great man, but celebrate his life and the imprint we all have left. Let us continue to be inspired by his example and strive forever to be the light of God in the world.\" When the crowd left, St. Peter's bell began to ring, marking the end of a day of sorrow and reverence, as well as the beginning of a new era in the Church. Pope Benedict XVI will always be remembered as a leader whose spirit and guidance will live on in our hearts, and as a saint dedicated to the service of God and his people.", "label": "machine"}

Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery, and others have staffed up in tech and consumer-facing roles as they focus on their direct-to-consumer businesses. And tech companies like TikTok have made key hires from more traditional media spheres.\n\nWith media and tech heavyweights increasingly vying for top talent, Insider analyzed recent pay data to see how much the major players in the space offered top talent.\n\nThe data, released by the US Department of Labor's Office of Foreign Labor Certification, shows how much companies offered to pay employees who they wanted to hire through work visas in the US.\n\nWe looked at pay data, mainly from October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2022, across nine companies including Hulu; Netflix; The New York Times; Roku; Snapchat owner Snap; TikTok and its parent company, Bytedance; Twitch, Amazon's livestreaming platform; and Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\n(We've also looked at salaries across industries that are transforming media, including the creator economy and US sports betting.)\n\nThese are base salaries, and do not include other forms of compensation such as stock options or cash bonuses.\n\nDisney\n\nDisney and its US streamer Hulu have offered base salaries ranging from $93,150 to $242,000 per year, according to wages from 140 foreign-labor-certification applications from October 2020 to June 2022.\n\nMost of the salaries were for streaming and tech jobs, including data scientist and software engineer roles.

Most of the jobs were based in California, but there were also positions based in other US states including New York, Massachusetts, and Texas.\n\nThe early days of the pandemic fueled a period of growth for Roku, helping to accelerate its transition from a small-but-mighty maker of streaming-TV boxes into a video platform business that makes most of its revenue through advertising.\n\nThe company has hit speed bumps since. Its growth has slowed, as have other streaming businesses. And its former platform boss Scott Rosenberg, who led Roku's push to sell advertising, left the company in the spring.\n\n\n\nBut Roku hasn't shown signs of pulling back on its investment into original content, and has continued to staff up recently to support its growth plans such as its smart-home ambitions.\n\nRead our full breakdown of how much Roku employees make.\n\nSnap\n\nSnap, the parent company of Snapchat, has offered base salaries ranging from $50,315 to $500,000 per year for various US roles \u2014 and even $1.95 million for one, according to wages from 303 foreign-labor-certification applications from October 2020 to December 2021.\n\nThe salaries were mainly for data, engineering, and product jobs, as well as some marketing and other positions.

{"text": "As a homemade billionaire and one of the most successful people of his generation, Mark Cuban has a little or two things to say about achieving success in business. But in his latest episode of the podcast, \"Shark Tank\" investors say he sees one habit that is critical for anyone, regardless of age, to succeed in the business world: learning new things every day. \"The first thing is that you have to learn something new every day,\" Kuban said in a recent episode of The Playbook, \"Without this, you won't expand your mind, you won't learn different methods, techniques, you won't see how other people solve problems, and you certainly won't stay up to date.\" The Cuban with a net worth of more than $4 billion said that in his experience, he was willing to accept new things and be aware of the latest developments, which allowed him to maintain a leading position in business. \"The more you learn, the better,\" he says. \"For example, if you're in finance and accounting, and you don't study technology, you miss a huge opportunity. It's not just learning new skills, it's also understanding the impact of new technologies and how they can be used to improve efficiency and create new business models.\" Kuban also said that while some learning processes can be done through books or online courses, it's important to engage in real-world scenarios as well. This could mean talking to people from different industries, or going out and visiting different businesses and understanding their processes. \"You have to go out and meet people,\" said Kuban. \"I think the biggest challenge is getting out of your comfort zone and really interacting with people who have different perspectives and different experiences. People who know more than you, even better than you - because you can learn from both.\" Cuba, a mentor to young entrepreneurs in the 'Shark Tank', said it was especially important for people in their 30s to focus on learning new skills and staying up to date. \"It's critical for any 30 people to learn new things every day and make sure you keep up with the latest trends and progress,\" said Kuban. \"This is the only way to stay ahead.\" Kuban added that while trying to learn something new every day seems incredible, it doesn't have to be complicated. This can be as simple as reading a few pages of a book or taking an online course. \"From a young age, find what's right for you,\" he said, \"five minutes a day or several hours a week - it's all about what you can manage, but the key is to do something.\" Ultimately, Kuban says the goal is to give yourself a \"competitive advantage\" so you're never left behind. \"If you don't learn something new every day, you won't expand your mind or keep up with the latest advances,\" Kuban said.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - A network of agents working to advance the interests of Russian President Vladimir Putin has been quietly working in Germany, trying to weaken support for Ukraine and win Berlin's foreign policy establishment. According to a two-month investigation by Reuters, the network of operators - including a wealthy Moscow businessman, a former Russian lawmaker and other political activists - influenced German public opinion by organizing events, building personal ties and lobbying pro-Moscow policies in Berlin. The main goal of the network is to keep Berlin away from the West and bring it closer to the Kremlin. Reuters contacted more than two dozen people in Germany and the rest of Europe with links to the network, whose activities were also tracked through interviews, public records and social media posts. The investigation revealed that the network's efforts ranged from arranging private meetings with leading German politicians to organizing protests outside Ukraine's embassy in Berlin. In recent years, efforts to bring Berlin closer to Moscow have been stepped up as tensions between Ukraine and Russia have escalated and after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. Sources told Reuters that the center of the network was George Bovt, a wealthy businessman based in Moscow. He is a former journalist who is believed to be close to the Kremlin and has served as a fixer for the network. According to a Reuters investigation, Bovt did not respond to numerous requests for comment on the story, and he helped arrange meetings between prominent Russian officials and key members of German foreign policymaking. At the same time, Buffett helped organize events in Germany aimed at advancing Moscow's views on a variety of issues, from Moscow's role in Syria to the situation in Ukraine. For example, in 2016, he was involved in an event organized in Munich for the Russian group \"New Way\", which was attended by senior Russian officials and aimed at undermining Ukraine's pro-Western government with the title \"Is Kiev's Ukrainian route moving in the right direction?\" The Kremlin is also actively using social media to promote its views on Ukraine in Germany. According to a study by the German think tank Institute for Social Science Research in Berlin, there has been an increase in the number of Twitter bots in Germany's pro-Kremlin Palace in recent years. These bots spread anti-Ukrainian messages and expanded the views of pro-Moscow commentators. The study also found that Russian robots were targeting major German media outlets, including Der Spiegel and Die Welt, with negative coverage of Ukraine. The propaganda campaign in favor of Moscow has also had an impact on German public opinion. Polls show that the German public's support for Ukraine has been declining in recent years, and many Germans are now unsure whether they should allow Ukraine to join the European Union. The activities of Germany's pro-Moscow network of operators are part of the Kremlin's broader efforts to influence European public opinion and politics. The goal is to weaken support for Ukraine and promote policies in favor of the Kremlin. It is unclear whether the Kremlin directly funds the network's operations in Germany. But evidence suggests that coordinated efforts have been made in Berlin to influence public opinion and promote pro-Moscow policies, suggesting that the network has received support from the Russian government. According to sources familiar with the matter, the German government is aware of the network's activities and is monitoring it, but has not taken any public action. For many Ukrainians, the activities of the German network are worrying. Ukraine relies heavily on Germany's support in its ongoing conflict with Russia, and pro-Moscow efforts to influence public opinion in Berlin could undermine Kiev's position. The crisis in Ukraine has already had a devastating impact on German-Russian relations, and the activities of the network have exacerbated an already tense atmosphere. The revelation of the network's activities in Germany also raises broader questions about the effectiveness of European democracies in countering the influence of Russian propaganda and misinformation. There is a need to raise awareness of Moscow's attempts to influence public opinion and promote pro-Moscow policies. European governments should take action to counter the influence of pro-Kremlin networks, and ensure that their citizens are better informed about Russian government activities.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The sports betting industry has been sliding since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Occupational and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) in 2018. But since then, its popularity has surged to become a major source of revenue for sports leagues, media companies, and technology startups. With so much change, from fanatics and Relative Kings entering the field to thriving M&A activity, it's no surprise that sports betting giants have had to keep up. To gain insight into the industry's outlook for 2023, Business Insider spoke with five top sports betting executives about the challenges and opportunities ahead of the year. From the M&A boom to the increase in mobile sports betting and changes in the legal environment, these executives list some of the biggest trends they're betting on for the New Year. Fans: Changing the way sports betting is done Executives in the sports betting industry agree that Fanatics is one of the most exciting trends in the sports betting space. The company announced a joint venture with international bookmaker Flutter Entertainment in August 2020, and has been boosting the sports betting industry ever since. The Fanatics-Flutter transaction combines Fanatics' expertise in e-commerce and live sports experiences with Flutter's industry leading sports betting platform, which is known for its sports betting sites such as Paddy Power, Betfair and Sportsbet. The partnership will allow Fanatics to give its customers the opportunity to make legitimate bets at sporting events as part of their live viewing experience. It also allows Flutter to gain a foothold in the U.S. sports betting market, since Fanatics has direct links with sports leagues, teams and venues. 2. Mobile sports betting: make it easier to play Mobile sports betting is expected to become one of the most important trends in the field of sports betting in 2023. As of 2021, there are 20 states in the United States and Washington, D.C. that offer legal mobile sports betting services. More states are expected to join the mobile sports betting community by 2023, and the mobile sports betting app will continue to make it easier for customers to place their bets. This means that customers no longer need to drive to a sports book or casino in order to bet at a sporting event. \"Mobile sports betting will be the biggest growth trend for sports betting in 2023,\" said Brad Hoeft, CEO of Sports Insights, a sports betting data provider. \"As more states legalize mobile sports betting, more people will be able to place bets on their favorite teams and players via phones and tablets.\" 3. Mergers and acquisitions: swing space The M&A scene in the sports betting industry has been booming over the past few years, and it is expected that this will continue until 2023. \"M&A activity will increase as companies seek to increase market share and build product offerings,\" said Joe Asher, CEO of U.S.-based sports betting operator William Hill USA, adding: \"We'll also see Sports Books looking to acquire technology companies that can help them more accurately price their bets and better target customers.\" It is expected that the number of M&A transactions in this sector will be driven by the desire to enter new markets, facilitate customer acquisitions and increase product supply. 4. Legal landscape: changing regulatory requirements Since 2018, sports betting has come a long way, but there is still a long way to go. Sports betting regulations vary from state to state, but there are still many changes. As more states roll out sports betting programs, executives expect further changes in national regulations, especially with respect to taxes and fees. \"When entering new markets, sports betting operators will need to keep up with the latest legal environment,\" said Jamie Shea, President of Sports Gaming Operator Rush Street Interactive. \"It's important to understand each state's regulatory requirements so you can comply and stay competitive.\" Social gambling: adding fun to the game Social betting is becoming more and more popular in the sports betting industry. Unlike traditional betting sites, social betting sites allow customers to place bets on each other. Social betting gives customers greater control over their betting experience and adds a fun element to the game. For example, customers can set up leading boards and pools of bets, or even create their own custom games. Social gambling is the perfect way for beginners to taste sports betting without spending money,\" says Patrick Doherty, president of social gaming operator Wannamakeabet. \"It also encourages customers to make more bets because they can compete friendlyly with friends and family.\" II. Conclusions Sports betting is a fast-growing industry, and these five trends represent only a small part of it.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the biggest decline in UK home prices since the financial crisis occurred in January. Prices fell 1.4 percent, the biggest decline since the global financial crisis in October 2008. The data shows that average home prices have fallen in every region of the UK. London saw the largest monthly decline, with house prices falling by 1.7%. The news comes after a period of sustained growth in house prices, with the average UK home price rising 14.5 per cent over the 12 months to the end of November. While some may argue that the current decline in house prices is a necessary adjustment to the overheated housing market, experts warn that the fall could be a sign of things to come. John Rowley, chairman of Property Eye, a real estate expert firm, said: \"The housing market is now under double shock - the end of the stamp duty holiday, replaced by an ineffective 3% surcharge on second-hand property and widespread economic uncertainty caused by Brexit. Together, these two factors have led buyers to reassess their plans, so the market has stagnated.\" Analysts said the outlook for the real estate market remains unclear as the UK economy remains fragile and uncertainty over Brexit persists. Jo Harris of Seymours, a real estate brokerage firm, said: \"The market has entered its initial stages this year. We believe we are at a crossroads with the property market and that either way is likely to happen. More deals are expected in the coming months and activity may increase as the year progresses.\" The Bank of England has also warned that the housing market could face challenges in the coming months. \"House prices are likely to remain low at the beginning of this year,\" said Governor Mark Carney. The World Bank has recently taken steps to help support the housing market, such as lowering interest rates and introducing a new \"buy-and-home assistance\" program, but analysts say these measures may take some time to come into effect. \"The impact of recent Bank of England interventions may take some time to manifest due to slow growth in consumer confidence and demand,\" said Nicholas Ayre, head of Real Estate Consulting Home Fusion. The key challenge for the coming months will be to bridge the gap between supply and demand that has been steadily growing over the past few months.\" The government has also introduced a series of measures to help first-time home buyers, such as the \"Buy Help\" program and the introduction of a shared ownership plan. However, experts warn that these measures alone may not be enough to revive the housing market. \"These measures are welcome, but not enough to compensate for the shortage of demand caused by the economic uncertainty brought about by Brexit. To stimulate the housing market, the government needs to increase investment in the housing supply to ensure that there is sufficient inventory to meet the demand and increase the availability of long-term low-deposit mortgages,\" said Charles Haresnape, Managing Director at Aldermore Mortgage Brokerage. Overall, the outlook for the property market in the coming months remains uncertain, with experts warning that a recent decline in house prices could be a sign of the future.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".. The events of January 6, 2021 still plague the United States. On that day, a group of supporters of President Donald Trump attacked the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to undermine the certification failure for Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election. The attack killed five people, including a police officer, and cast a dark shadow over the country. Now, more than a year after the siege, a key unanswered question remains - is there a broader, deeper conspiracy at work? It's an issue that a newly formed committee of lawmakers from political parties, historians and experts is trying to figure out. On December 16, the House of Representatives and Senate unanimously voted to establish a 10-member January 6 committee. This was a rare moment of bipartisan unity on Capitol Hill. The commission's mandate is clear: it will review the circumstances of the attack and investigate \"facts and causes\" associated with the invasion of the Capitol. This includes the investigation of broader and longer-term factors that may have contributed to the day's violence, including any potential coordination between political, ideological or other organizations, as well as actions taken by the Government before and after the attack. But in recent weeks, the future of the Commission itself has been called into question. The reason is the Republican response to this idea. While a fairly small number of Republicans support the bill, many within the party's leadership have been fierce in their opposition. Key figures such as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and House Republican Session Chair Lisa Cheney (R-WY) have denounced the proposal as a \"political exercise\" and \"political attack\" on former President Trump, who continues to deny responsibility for the attacks. Even some who voted in favor of the measure expressed skepticism. Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK) said in a speech to the House of Representatives: \"We shouldn't be here, I mean, really. This is another area of intense partisan disagreement. The debate over the committee's intentions and findings.\" The Republican leadership in both the House and Senate is now putting a lot of effort into defending Trump's record and maintaining his base of support. For many, the committee represents a potential political threat. McCarthy has made it clear that he doesn't approve of the commission if it becomes a \"witch hunt.\" Instead, he says he wants more focused investigations into why law enforcement and intelligence agencies failed to act to stop the attack. The committee may be concerned about law enforcement and intelligence failures - a fact that Republicans might fear could hurt Trump and his supporters. If the Republican Party continues to boycott the committee and fails to appoint its Republican members, the entire project could collapse. It will be a tragedy, because the fatal questions posed by this attack and its aftermath will remain unanswered: what happened, who is responsible for it, and what can be done to ensure that this does not happen again? The riots at the Capitol are a blow to America's system. The country needs to figure out what happened, who is responsible, and how to move forward.The January 6 commission is the only way to get these answers. Let's hope that Republicans in Congress can see that this is in everyone's best interest and allows the committee to carry out its important work.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "And with Stimmy. Elon Musk, one of the most influential figures in technology, has brought his views to Twitter on a range of topics, including renewable energy, electric vehicles and space exploration. But the controversial entrepreneur faces massive criticism from the public on the platform, prompting some to question his existence. If you're thinking about cutting the rope, consider alternatives to Twitter like Mastodon and Steemit. Both are open source social networks that are free of charge and more privacy-focused than Twitter. Mastodon is a decentralized, open source Twitter competitor launched in 2017 by German programmer Eugen Rochko. Its architecture is the same as that of popular Weibo sites, where users' posts appear on their home schedules, respond to and refer to form threads. It also has \"community\" - essentially public and private groups with which users can join and use these group releases to interact with other members. A key difference between Mastodon and Twitter is that user posts are more widely distributed and visible due to their decentralized architecture. This means your posts can be seen by users around the world, not just those who follow you. On the other hand, Steemit is a blockchain-based social network that rewards users for creating and managing content. Like Mastodon, it's built on a decentralized platform with \"Steem\" to reward users for publishing and managing content. Steemit has been around since 2016, but the platform has recently gained more attention with the launch of the new cryptocurrency STEEM Power.STEEM Power is essentially a loyalty program where users who hold a certain number of STEEM tokens can receive additional tokens and rewards when publishing or directing content. Unlike Twitter, where Streetmit relies largely on algorithms to determine what content is seen and what isn't, Steemit is driven by a blockchain-based democratic system. Only users who vote for it can see content, which means that users can only see what gets the most votes. However, unlike Mastodon, Steemit still has a long way to go before it becomes Twitter's official rival. The platform is still in its infancy and many of its features are lacking compared to them, such as real-time conversations and tags. Mastodon and Steemit offer an interesting alternative for those who want to get rid of Twitter's constraints. While the two platforms have a long way to go before competing with the world's largest social networks, they are a more private and secure alternative that could be a viable option for those looking to leave Twitter.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Bulls are excited about getting the midterm elections behind us. Since 1950, all 18 midterm elections have been followed by an up year for stocks, according to LPL Financial. LPL also noted nearly identical returns after wins by both Democrats and Republicans, but not all gridlock gets treated equally. Chris Harvey from Wells Fargo noted this morning in a note to clients that, since 1948, the best combination for returns is a Democratic President, and a Republican House and Senate. That has occurred on four occasions since 1948 and has produced a 41% two-year return in the S & P 500. \"We believe this remains the most likely outcome for Election Day 2022,\" Harvey said. The reason the markets favor gridlock seems clear, LPL Financial said: 1) Lower risk of tax increases, 2) More centrist appointments to key posts, and 3) greater difficulty raising the debt ceiling. Regardless, bulls expecting an end of the year lift from the election tailwinds and other seasonal factors should not get too enthusiastic: strategist after strategist has warned that the macro environment is the dominant factor in setting stock prices, meaning the Fed and its battle against inflation, recession risks, and geopolitics will trump any seasonal factors.

Drew Desilver at Pew Research Center wrote a great deep dive explaining this process last month.\n\nOur own experience as consumers informs us that prices on various goods and services are rising, and the inflation rate, derived from the CPI, confirms that our experience is true. But what the CPI can't explain \u2014 at least, not fully \u2014 is how and why inflation is rising.\n\nThe first thing to note is that inflation isn't just a problem in the United States\n\nVirtually every nation in the world is struggling with skyrocketing inflation rates, though the rate is increasing higher in the US than in most nations. The United Kingdom, for example, reported a 5.4% inflation rate in December.\n\nThe reason for this universal price hike is relatively simple: The pandemic shut down the global supply chain, which then caused a worldwide traffic jam for goods ranging from auto parts to semiconductors at the exact same time that demand for goods like electronics and home-improvement items increased for hundreds of millions of locked-down consumers around the world.\n\nChad Stone at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive think tank, among others, believes that inflation is largely the result of global consumer demand switching almost overnight from services to goods during the pandemic.\n\nThe second thing is that even if supply-chain problems were completely smoothed out over the next few months, inflation is still likely to be a big problem in the US for at least the next year\n\nThat's because rents and shelter costs, which make up a third of the CPI's \"market basket,\" are soaring right now.\n\nAs Zach Silk writes in the most recent issue of The Pitch, the sister newsletter to the \"Pitchfork Economics\" podcast, \"The average rent in the United States is nearly $1,900 a month, an increase of nearly $300 over this time last year \u2014 and that's the average, remember, while some cities like Miami have seen a 40% year-over-year increase of rents.\"\n\nEconomists warn that due to a variety of complex CPI aggregation issues, even if every price in America magically stopped rising tomorrow, rising rents alone would continue to drive up the overall inflation rate for the next year or so.\n\nThe last point to keep in mind with inflation is that, like everything else to do with the economy, those rising prices aren't established by some objective, all-seeing, all-knowing \"free market\" that assesses every aspect of the economy and sets prices accordingly.\n\nIn fact, a good number of the rising prices we're paying weren't strictly necessary at all\n\nDuring the last quarter of 2021, for example, Starbucks reported an eye-popping 31% increase in profits, and revenue increased for the quarter by almost 20% to just over $8 billion. On the same call that Starbucks announced those terrific numbers, the corporation also announced that it would raise its prices over the next year \u2014 probably more than once.\n\nThe company blamed \"supply-chain disruptions\" and higher costs for labor for the price hikes, but Jake Johnson at media nonprofit Common Dreams said that they didn't mention one raise in particular: Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson's pay increased by almost 40% last year to more than $20 million.\n\nIt's not just Starbucks: Many American corporations see inflationary panic as an opportunity to boost their profits. The Wall Street Journal reported that Todd Kahn, the CEO of luxury fashion brand Coach, even admitted that his company's \"rise in [prices] isn't really about inflation \u2026 it's about reducing discounting.\"\n\nJournalist Matt Stoller estimated that 60% of the price increases that ordinary Americans are paying are going directly to corporate profits, not to compensate for global supply issues or compensate for higher-priced goods.\n\nOf course, none of this context about inflation helps the ordinary American consumer, who's paying more for everyday items\n\nAll those wage increases that have happened since the labor market turned in favor of workers last year weren't enough to keep up with inflation, which took a 2.4% bite out of the average American paycheck.\n\nThese inflationary stresses are a complicated global problem, and it's going to take a suite of policies \u2014 from using government muscle to help smooth out lingering supply-chain snags to combating shameless corporate price gouging and exploitative rent hikes \u2014 to push inflation back down to healthy levels.\n\nBut you shouldn't buy finger-pointing that tries to pin inflation solely on lockdowns, stimulus checks, or other policies that were passed to help keep Americans safe and supported through the worst of pandemic.\n\nThat's the worst kind of trickle-down fear-mongering \u2014 meant to keep workers angry with workers and everyone's eyes off the real profiteers.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Wall Street began the new year with a broad rebound as U.S. stocks soared in its first day trading after turbulent 2020. The S&P 500 index rose by 0.7% and the Tien Dou Jones Industrial Average also increased by 0.6%.The Nasdaq Composite Index rose by 0.9%, while the high-tech index jumped by 4.6% in December. New Year's earnings were driven by optimism about the development of new vaccines and hopes for an economic recovery in 2021. \"We've been expecting environmental risks, and with market gains on the first day of trading, investors are clearly feeling more upside potential than downside,\" said Tom Cahill, managing director at Vanguard Investments. The market's general rise comes one year after a turbulent year, when the S&P 500 fell 11% in its worst annual performance since 2008. Wall Street has experienced dramatic volatility as cases of coronavirus surge and economic prospects remain uncertain. \"After 2020, investors' willingness to enter the market on the first day of 2021 is a sign of optimism,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. \"Despite various uncertainties, we did see an impressive relative strength in the market in December and continue into 2021.\" As cases of coronavirus continue to climb, some investors are cautious about the coming year. However, Pfizer's announcement that its vaccine is more than 90% effective and that the Moderna vaccine has been approved gives hope. \"The combination of Pfizer and Moderna, and their relative effectiveness, does drive the mood here,\" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Blakeley Consulting Group. The price of technology stocks rose, in part because investors were looking for momentum. Apple, Amazon and Tesla all soared on the first day of trading, rising by more than 2.4%, 1.8% and 2.5%, respectively. The Fed's loose monetary policy has supported the stock market, and chairman Jerome Powell said this month that the central bank will not raise interest rates until the economic outlook improves. The Fed's continued asset purchases have constrained interest rates and supported the rotation of tech stocks. With the coronavirus stimulus coming to pass in Congress, investors are hoping businesses will get support and drive their recovery. In addition to strong technology growth, banks at Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley rose 1.3%, 1.8% and 1.1% respectively. \"With the scale of the stimulus package, low interest rates and improved vaccine prospects, there are many reasons to be optimistic about 2021,\" said AJ Bell financial analyst Laith Khalaf.

{"text": "The stock market has been tired of activity this week, as stocks have risen or fallen due to various earnings results, economic data and other news. One of the stocks that performed strongly this week was Moderna Inc. (MRNA). The biotech company announced higher than expected earnings in the third quarter, more than $0.15 per share for analysts. Analysts expect Moderna's earnings to decline as a result of higher spending, but the company managed to outperform expectations. The strong results were helped by the sale of its mRNA-1273 vaccine, which has been approved for emergency use in the United States and is currently being administered around the world. Two other stocks that performed strongly this week were homebuilders D.R. Horton Inc (DHI) and NVR Inc (NVR). The two companies released strong quarterly earnings reports this week, with D.R. Horton's net income up nearly 20% from the previous year and NVR's net revenue up 13%. The shares of both companies have soared as a result of the news, with D.R. Horton's share price rising more than 10% this week and NVR's by more than 7%. Since the start of the year, their shares have also risen sharply, with D.R. Horton up more than 95% and NVR up over 90%. The strong performance of both homes can be attributed to the continued housing boom in the U.S., where home starts rose 3.2 percent in October and house sales are expected to remain strong throughout the winter, partly due to low interest rates. Other stocks that performed strongly this week included semiconductor maker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), whose earnings were higher than expected, with shares rising more than 8 percent. Payment processor Square (SQ) also exceeded expectations, with shares up more than 10 percent. The stock market as a whole performed strongly this week, with the S&P 500 up more than 2% and the Nasdaq up more than 3%. For the sixth consecutive month, the market has been growing steadily, in part due to improved economic data and news about potential coronavirus vaccines.

{"text": "Malawi announced on Thursday that it had postponed the reopening of schools in the 2021 school year due to a sharp increase in cholera cases in the country. The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology said the move was aimed at protecting the health and safety of schoolchildren across the country. \"In light of the current cholera outbreak, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology has decided to postpone the reopening of schools until the situation is brought under control and the risk for children attending school is minimized,\" the ministry said in a statement. The decision comes at a time when Malawi is facing the worst outbreak of waterborne disease in more than a decade. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of cholera cases in Malawi rose to nearly 19,000 in 2020, a significant increase from the 1,500 reported in 2019. The increase is due to poor sanitation, inadequate access to clean water and lack of awareness about diseases and prevention methods. In recent weeks, the disease has spread from the capital Lilongwe to other parts of the country. The Ministry of Education stated that the decision to postpone the reopening of schools had been taken following extensive consultations with key stakeholders, including the health sector, school administrators, parents, teachers and students. The Department also indicated that it was exploring ways to reopen schools safely, including by providing additional resources for improved sanitation and hygiene, strengthening monitoring efforts and providing training and awareness-raising activities on adequate sanitation and hygiene. Education Minister Bright Massaka said in a statement that delays were necessary to ensure the safety of students. \"The well-being of our students is critical, which is why we have decided to delay the school's reopening,\" he said. \"We believe this is the right thing to do, and we will continue to work hard to make sure that everything we do is necessary to protect students and ensure the safety of our schools.\" The government has launched a massive vaccination campaign to fight the cholera outbreak, with more than 1 million doses of vaccines so far. The school's reopening was originally scheduled for January 11, but that date may now be delayed. At the same time, the ministry urged the public to maintain good hygiene and hygiene practices and seek medical help if they show signs and symptoms of cholera. The government is also providing clean water and adequate sanitation in areas affected by the outbreak. The delay in reopening schools is a setback to the progress of education in Malawi. Education experts warn that disruptions caused by school closures could have a negative impact on students, especially in primary and secondary schools, who may find it difficult to keep up with their peers. The government is also concerned that closing schools could lead to further spread of the disease, as children return to areas with increased levels of infection. However, the government has stated that the decision was made for the health and safety of all students and there is a need to ensure that students are adequately protected.", "label": "machine"}

Stabenow's impending retirement turns Michigan\u2019s next Senate race into one of the most competitive in the country.\n\nIn 2000, Stabenow was the first woman from Michigan elected to the U.S. Senate. But she has a political career that has spanned 50 years. Stabenow cited \"passing the torch\" to a younger generation of political leaders as motive for stepping down.\n\nInspired by a new generation of leaders, I have decided to pass the torch in the U.S. Senate.

Debbie Stabenow (@SenStabenow) January 5, 2023\n\n\"As part of my own new generation, I was elected to the Ingham County Commission in 1974 at the age of 24,\" she said in a statement. \"As the youngest and first woman to chair the Board, this began years of breaking barriers, blazing trails, and being the 'first' woman to reach historic milestones as an elected official, including the honor of being the first woman from Michigan elected to the U.S. Senate. But I have always believed it's not enough to be the 'first' unless there is a 'second' and a 'third.'\"\n\n\u201cUnder the cloud of unprecedented threats to our democracy and our basic freedoms, a record-breaking number of people voted last year in Michigan. Young people showed up like never before. This was a very hopeful sign for our future.\"\n\nWhile the current political climate in Michigan favors Democrats following a midterm election where they flipped the state House and Senate, the state is still expected to be one of the nation\u2019s premier battlegrounds in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nOnly one Michigan Republican has held a seat in the Senate in the past 40 years.\n\nStabenow joined the U.S. House in 1996. In 2000, she made history by becoming the first woman to be elected senator in Michigan, defeating a Republican incumbent. She turned back GOP challenges in 2006 and 2012 and defeated Republican John James by 6.5 percentage points in her last election in 2018. James was elected to the House in November.\n\nStabenow is the longest-serving member of the state\u2019s congressional delegation. She is chair of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, making her the No. 3 ranking party leader, and heads the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee.\n\nStabenow most recently has been involved in bipartisan legislation aimed at increasing oversight of cryptocurrencies. She has also led efforts to expand and increase funding for mental health care both nationally and in Michigan.\n\nAhead of 2024, the date of Michigan\u2019s primary is yet to be finalized after the Democratic National Committee rule-making arm voted to move Michigan up in the party\u2019s presidential primary calendar.

{"text": "Caroline Ellison, a former chief executive of the now-dissolved cryptocurrency derivatives exchange, told a judge on Tuesday that she was \"really sorry\" for deceiving the company's FTX customers for millions of dollars. \"I know what I'm doing is wrong,\" Ellison told U.S. District Judge William O'Grady, who was sentenced in the Eastern District of New York. In April, 31-year-old Ellison admitted to wire fraud and operating an unauthorized money transfer business. Prosecutors said Ellison was involved in a scheme to defraud FTX customers, the cryptocurrency derivative exchange she co-founded with her husband in 2017 for at least $3 million. According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, between December 2017 and December 2020, Ellison and others used their access to FTX customer accounts to manipulate their prices and artificially exaggerate the value of a cryptocurrency-based FTX contract. Ellison reportedly then used the proceeds to purchase luxury goods, including real estate in her husband's name, as well as fund her own personal bank account and crypto wallet. \"This is not an ordinary criminal case,\" Judge O'Grady said in court, \"it involves the use of technology to commit fraud, which is a serious crime, but also a bold crime.\" As part of her plea agreement, Ellison will reimburse all the money she stole from FTX clients and agree to cooperate with the investigation. She also agreed to a three-year supervisory release and pay a fine of $5,000. Allison regrets her actions and asks for forgiveness. \"I'm fully responsible for my actions,\" she said. \"I'm really sorry for what I did.\" Judge O'Grady accepted Ellison's defence and sentenced her to two years in prison, followed by three years of supervised release. \"The court must take the crimes committed seriously and impose a sentence that sends a message that those who commit such acts will be held accountable,\" O'Grady said. This sentence is a severe warning to those who engage in fraud in the cryptocurrency space. Clearly, the U.S. government is cracking down on anyone trying to deceive investors, customers and the public. \"The verdict against Ms. Ellison should be a warning story for those who try to engage in cryptocurrency fraud, and we remain committed to prosecuting those who seek to exploit our market for their own personal gain,\" said U.S. Attorney David Weiss. The case against Ellison is part of the U.S. government's ongoing efforts to combat cryptocurrency fraud. Several others have been charged with similar crimes in recent months, and the Department of Justice is actively investigating a number of other potential crypto-fraud cases. Cryptocurrency fraud is a major problem in the industry, and the US government takes it very seriously. As Ellison's sentence suggests, those who engage in such activities should know that they will face serious consequences.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The country style has been popular in the western United States, and even in this digital age, consumers continue to buy from Western-style retailers. Now Bank of America is betting on a retail company that it believes will surge by more than 30% over the next 12 months. Bank of America began reporting on Boot Barn Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: BOOT) on Monday and gave the stock a \"buy\" rating for its $35 price target, 32% higher than Friday's close. Bank of America believes that in addition to strategic initiatives to improve operations and further expand e-commerce, the company is ready to benefit from the growing popularity of country fashion and increasing demand for clothing. Boot Barn Holdings is a Western-style clothing, footwear and accessories retailer with more than 230 stores across the country. The company also operates e-commerce sites for its stores and other professional retailers, with strong presence in the western United States located in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington State, and Wyoming. Bank of America analyst Robert Ohmes sees Boot Barn as a \"first-class\" operator in the Western clothing market, which he believes could drive growth over the next 12 to 18 months. According to Ohmes, the company has strong market positions, focused strategies and health needs for its products, especially its garments. Analysts also believe that Boot Barn's growing e-commerce business is a key factor in its continued expansion of market share potential. \"BOOT is driving strong online sales and traffic growth for its direct consumer and professional retail sites, and is a leading operator in the Western clothing market,\" said Ohmes. \"We see BOOT as well positioned to benefit from current digital transformation trends, increasing demand for outdoor apparel, and strategic initiatives to improve operations and further expand into e-commerce.\" In addition, Boot Barn is actively taking steps to enhance its digital capabilities, such as expanding the use of artificial intelligence and using machine learning to customize and optimize customers' shopping experiences. The company has also taken a number of steps to increase its customer base, including investing in marketing and commodity partnerships with major brands such as Pendleton, Stetson, Restor, Tony Lamar, and Carhart. Ohmes believes these efforts will help drive further sales growth, noting: \"We expect that there will be a larger and more profitable customer base as these initiatives improve brand awareness and store traffic.\" The analyst also noted that the company's store renewal program, including a focus on new store formats, could help drive traffic and revenue. \"We believe BOOT's investment in store formats and product features will drive traffic and sales growth in the medium to long term,\" Ohmes said. Overall, Bank of America sees Boot Barn as well positioned to benefit from current rural fashion demand and the ongoing shift towards digital retail, and believes that the stock has the potential to rebound by more than 30% over the next 12 months. \"We believe BOOT can benefit from today's demand for Western fashion, a larger and more profitable customer base, and initiatives to improve operations and further expand e-commerce,\" said Ohmes. \"We are confident that BOOT will generate more than 30% in the next 12 months.\"", "label": "machine"}

Spot gold fell 1.2% to $1,841.08 per ounce on 16:14 Greenwich Mean Time, the lowest level since late November. U.S. gold futures prices dropped 1.3% to $1,846. Strong U.S. economic data on Tuesday boosted the Fed's outlook for a long-term rate hike and lifted its green back. The dollar index rose 0.4 percent, now in its third straight day of gains. The U.S. housing starts report performed significantly better than expected, with a 2.8% drop of 0.3% over expectations. In addition, the report shows that permits also rose by 1.3%, surpassing an expected decline of 0.5%. Further increases in US Treasury yields have increased demand for greenbacks, putting pressure on gold. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield has risen to 1.63%, the highest level since March 2020. The appreciation of the dollar offsets investors' concerns about a new coronavirus found in the UK, as well as an ongoing rise in infections in the US. \"The recent series of U.S. economic data is certainly positive,\" said Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy at TD Securities, \"but it was a bit too strong for the market and led to lower gold prices on Tuesday.\" The U.S. economy continues to show strong signs of recovery and is expected to continue growing in 2021 as vaccine rollouts and fiscal stimulus should continue to boost demand. The Federal Reserve has already committed to keeping interest rates at or near current levels by 2022 in order to support the recovery. However, traders now speculate that central banks may be signaling rate hikes sooner than expected. Gold investors are also keeping a close eye on the progress of the U.S. stimulus package. Negotiations between the White House and Democrats over the bailout program have been going on for weeks, but no agreement has been reached. \"When the stimulus is finally passed, it's likely that gold will get a boost again,\" Melek said. \"But in the short term, strong data and potential interest rate hikes in market pricing could put gold under pressure.\" Gold is seen as a safe haven asset that typically gains when economic uncertainty rises. Since the outbreak, gold has gained strong returns as the Fed lowered interest rates to near-zero levels, making it an even more attractive asset for investors. However, with the U.S. economy on its path to recovery and the prospect of rising interest rates, gold may be in a low period.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nEmail addresses linked to more than 200 million Twitter profiles are currently circulating on underground hacker forums, security experts say. The apparent data leak could expose the real-life identities of anonymous Twitter users and make it easier for criminals to hijack Twitter accounts, the experts warned, or even victims\u2019 accounts on other websites.\n\nThe trove of leaked records also includes Twitter users\u2019 names, account handles, follower numbers and the dates the accounts were created, according to forum listings reviewed by security researchers and shared with CNN.\n\n\u201cBad actors have won the jackpot,\u201d said Rafi Mendelsohn, a spokesman for Cyabra, a social media analysis firm focused on identifying disinformation and inauthentic online behavior. \u201cPreviously private data such as emails, handles, and creation date can be leveraged to build smarter and more sophisticated hacking, phishing and disinformation campaigns.\u201d\n\nSome reports suggested the data was collected in 2021 through a bug in Twitter\u2019s systems, a flaw the company fixed in 2022 after a separate incident in July involving 5.4 million Twitter accounts alerted the company to the vulnerability.\n\nTroy Hunt, a security researcher, said Thursday that his analysis of the data \u201cfound 211,524,284 unique email addresses\u201d that had been leaked. The Washington Post earlier reported a forum listing promoting the data of 235 million accounts.\n\nHunt did not immediately respond to a question from CNN asking whether the records would be added to his website, haveibeenpwned.com, which allows users to search hacked records to determine if they have been affected. CNN has not independently verified the records\u2019 authenticity.\n\nTwitter didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Its communication team, along with roughly half of Twitter\u2019s overall workforce, was gutted after billionaire Elon Musk completed his acquisition the company in late October. The significant staff reductions could now add to concerns about the company\u2019s ability to respond to security threats.\n\nThe breadth of the leaked data could allow malicious actors or repressive governments to connect anonymous Twitter handles with the real names or email addresses of their owners, potentially unmasking dissidents, journalists, activists or other at-risk users around the world, security researchers warn.\n\n\u201cFor those people, this is a very consequential breach,\u201d said John Scott-Railton, a security researcher at The University of Toronto\u2019s Citizen Lab.\n\nThe account data could also be valuable to hackers who can use the information as part of password-reset attempts and account takeovers. The risk is particularly high for individuals who use the same account credentials on Twitter as they do for other digital services such as banks or cloud storage, researchers said, because hackers could take information gleaned from the leak to pry open user accounts elsewhere.\n\nVerified Twitter users caught up in the apparent leak, or users with particularly large followings, will be particularly valuable targets as a result of the leak, security experts warned, as those account holders may be especially influential celebrities or susceptible to extortion.\n\nTo protect themselves from phishing attempts, internet users should use unique passwords for each online service and keep track of them using a digital password manager, security researchers say. They should also enable multi-factor authentication for each of their accounts, and exercise caution when opening unsolicited email or links.\n\nAccording to the cybersecurity news outlet BleepingComputer, which did claim to test the data, the latest dump appears similar to a leaked dataset advertised on hacking forums in November containing an alleged 400 million records, but slimmed down to eliminate some duplicate records. Twitter has not commented on that leak.\n\nReports of the leak could expand Twitter\u2019s already significant legal and regulatory risk.\n\nIn December, Twitter\u2019s main European privacy regulator, the Irish Data Protection Commission, said it is investigating the July 2022 leak as a possible violation of Europe\u2019s signature privacy law, known as GDPR.\n\nLast summer, the company\u2019s former head of security, Peiter \u201cMudge\u201d Zatko, filed a whistleblower report to the US government alleging long-ignored security vulnerabilities in Twitter\u2019s operations. Zatko claimed that Twitter\u2019s shortcomings on security reflected a breach of Twitter\u2019s binding commitments to the Federal Trade Commission, a serious offense. (Twitter broadly and repeatedly pushed back at Zatko\u2019s allegations.)\n\nSuccessive incidents at Twitter have led to the company signing two consent orders with the FTC since 2011 to improve its cybersecurity posture. Violations of FTC orders can lead to fines, business restrictions and even sanctions targeting individual executives.\n\nIn November, top Twitter officials responsible for privacy and security resigned from the company, just days after Musk closed his purchase of the platform and amid the mass layoffs that in some cases cut whole departments.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "LONDON, Dec 22 (Reuters) - China's imports of primary aluminium jumped to a one-year high of 110,700 tonnes in November in a significant reversal of the recent trend.\n\nThe country flipped to net exporter in the first half of 2022, with primary metal shipped as far as Europe and the United States to capitalise on sky-high physical premiums.\n\nThe premiums are now much reduced. That for duty-unpaid in Europe collapsed from over $600 per tonne in May to a current $250 over the London Metal Exchange (LME) cash price.\n\nWhile European smelter output declines under the weight of high energy prices, the region is also bracing for a recessionary hit to demand.\n\nChina appears to be taking up some of the slack as its own production momentum stalls just as the country tries to open up from quarantine and lockdown.\n\nChina's imports and exports of primary unwrought aluminium\n\nTRADE FLOWS FLIP AGAIN\n\nChina's primary aluminium export surge has passed. Outbound shipments totalled 190,000 tonnes in the first eight months of the year, the highest volume of exports since 2010.\n\nExports have since shrunk to 5,000 tonnes over the September-November period with high-volume shipments to Europe and the United States replaced by a trickle of material to African destinations.\n\nUntil last month, imports had been subdued relative to the previous couple of years and largely comprised Russian metal shunned by Western buyers after Russia's \"special military operation\" in Ukraine began in February.\n\nRussian imports hit a fresh 2022 high of 56,000 tonnes in November but its share of imports dropped to 51% from 85% in June. The balance was sourced from a range of countries, suggesting more Chinese pull than Russian push.\n\nIt's worth noting that China's imports of unwrought aluminium alloy have remained consistently strong at around 100,000 tonnes per month since a structural shift higher in 2019.\n\nThe step change coincided with a slump in imports of aluminium scrap ahead of a planned ban in 2020. The ban was pulled at the last moment and replaced with tighter purity thresholds.\n\nScrap imports have since rebounded, up 60% so far this year, but without any impact on alloy flows.\n\nGlobal aluminium production monthly change annualised\n\nSLOWING MOMENTUM\n\nChina's renewed import appetite for primary aluminium looks at odds with the combination of lockdown-weakened demand and strong domestic production growth.\n\nHeadline national output was up by 7.2% year-on-year in November with cumulative production up 3.1% in the first 11 months of 2022, the latest estimates by the International Aluminium Institute (IAI) showed.\n\nHowever, the year-on-year comparison is accentuated by a low base in the closing months of 2021, when multiple producers were forced to reduce run-rates during a rolling energy crunch.\n\nExpressed in terms of annualised production, China's collective run-rate has dropped by almost 1.2 million tonnes since August. That's not as much as the 2.0-million tonne decline in late 2021 but still a significant dissipation of the early-year production surge.\n\nEnergy is again the culprit.\n\nAlthough there are no national blanket power restrictions over the winter heating season this year, provinces have delegated powers to manage their local power balances and the smelter hits have been mounting up.\n\nSichuan briefly rationed power to industrial users, including aluminium smelters, in August because of a protracted drought in the hydro-rich province.\n\nThe following month Yunnan ordered its smelters to reduce operating rates by 10% for the same reason, lifting the mandate to 20% in October.\n\nLast month saw several smelters in Henan province reduce output by 10% on a combination of weak market conditions and pressure from local winter heating restrictions, according to consultancy AZ Global.\n\nThe seasonal power pressures have spread to the province of Guizhou this month with local smelters taking cuts of up to 31% of capacity, AZ Global reports.\n\nGuizhou is a relatively small aluminium province with annual production of around one million tonnes but Yunnan is a growing hub of production on the basis of its green energy credentials.\n\nHongqiao, China's largest private operator, is undeterred by this year's power constraints and is moving more of its capacity there.\n\nHowever, the concentration of smelters in Yunnan and Sichuan leaves China's domestic supply chain facing a new source of instability in the form of seasonal rainfall levels.\n\nSHIFT TO SURPLUS\n\nThe scale of the cumulative production hit in China has been masked by impact of rolling lockdowns and a foundering property sector on domestic demand.\n\nThe partial lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, although fraught with the danger of a wave of Omicron infections, is expected to revitalise Chinese growth over 2023.\n\nAny recovery impetus will require an aluminium restock. Visible inventory on the Shanghai Futures Exchange has slumped by 71% since the start of January and at a current 92,373 tonnes is around the lowest levels since 2016.\n\nIt is too early to say if last month's jump in imports is an early sign of domestic recovery in the aluminium sector but it signals a shift in market flows.\n\nThe Western deficits earlier this year attracted significant volumes of metal from Asia, including China. The supply-chain tension has accordingly eased and the market focus has shifted to weakening demand and the potential for large amounts of aluminium to head to LME warehouses.\n\nThe east-west pendulum is swinging back again and it's China that looks de-stocked and in need of some top-up metal from the spot market.\n\nHow much will depend on how China's many provincial authorities balance their power systems over the next few winter months.\n\nThe opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.\n\nEditing by Barbara Lewis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n\nOpinions expressed are those of the author.

Today, only two belong to Wells Fargo and JPMorgan \u2014 and both are held by landlords, not homeowners who use the properties as their primary residences.\n\nBloomberg's reporting on Walbrook Avenue reinforces how the economic disaster brought on by the subprime-mortgage crash that stretched from 2007 to 2010 disproportionately hurt minority households \u2014 and how the effects are being felt to this day.\n\nBlack Americans have historically owned their own homes at much lower rates than white Americans, and the disappearance of these large lenders from Walbrook Avenue and elsewhere have contributed to what is known as the homeownership gap. As of October 2021, according to the US Census Bureau, 45% of Black Americans owned homes, which is nearly 30 points below the rate of white Americans: 74.6%.\n\nOn Walbrook Avenue, the absence of large lenders has left many locals without a lifeline. Several residents like Terrence Jones Jr. \u2014 who was just a teenager when he and his family were forced out of their home in 2013 \u2014 have lost their homes to foreclosure only to see their mortgages sold to investors who flipped their properties for a tidy profit.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg's investigation, Wells Fargo, which purchased the mortgage on the Joneses' family home from an undisclosed lender in 2012, sold at least 3,000 of its Baltimore properties to real-estate attorneys from that year to 2021. While it's unclear how many homeowners have lost their properties as a result, Bloomberg suggested that the bank's actions had contributed to lower rates of Black homeownership in the area.\n\nRudy Miales, a retired resident of Walbrook Avenue who paid off his mortgage in 1980, told Bloomberg he'd seen many of his neighbors leave the area, replaced by renters who often do not have ties to the community.\n\n\"All these people over here, they might not be here tomorrow,\" Miales told Bloomberg, pointing to several rental units near his home.\n\nThe racial wealth gap grows as Black Americans lose access to capital\n\nBecause homeownership is a key driver of wealth, the banks' pullback from Walbrook Avenue ends up limiting the prospects of financial gain for many locals who remain. It's a problem affecting many predominantly Black communities throughout the US.\n\nAmerica's biggest banks and lenders recognized the problem was dire. After the 2008-2009 financial crisis, several financial institutions made pledges to invest billions of dollars to support Black homeownership.\n\nBut in the years since, many of their actions have fallen short of their promises due to a mixture of lending discrimination and the banks' tendency to avoid Federal Housing Administration-backed home loans \u2014 a particularly popular mortgage program for first-time buyers that offers low-down-payment options.\n\nWells Fargo made the largest vow in 2017: a pledge to lend $60 billion for the creation of 250,000 Black homeowners within a decade. But, according to Bloomberg, it underwrote 42% fewer mortgages to Black buyers in 2021 than in the year it announced its goal.\n\n\"That's clearly going in the wrong direction,\" Brad Blackwell, a retired senior executive behind Wells Fargo's 2017 goal, told Bloomberg.\n\nA 2021 study from Brookings Institution, a nonprofit public-policy organization, shows that since 2010, the number of banks in majority-black neighborhoods has decreased by 14.6%. Their withdrawal has helped to widen the nation's racial wealth gap.\n\n\"Achieving the American dream \u2014 the opportunity to succeed, to provide food and shelter for family members, education for children, hope for a better life, and freedom of opportunity \u2014 requires capital,\" the Brookings researchers Kristen Broady, Mac McComas, and Amine Ouazad wrote in the study. \"But, in the United States, access to capital for individuals and business owners is uneven based on race. The racial wealth gap remains significant.\"\n\nIndeed, government estimates indicate that in the third quarter of this year white Americans held 82% of total US wealth while making up roughly 60% of the population, whereas Black Americans made up 13% of the population but held only about 5% of the wealth.\n\nCorrection: December 29, 2022 \u2014 An earlier version of this story misstated the most recent estimate for the share of US wealth held by Black Americans. It is about 5%, not 45%.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Billionaire George Soros quietly donated nearly $140 million to political causes in 2021 through his Open Society Foundation, an ambitious effort to fund issues of progress. The Foundation's end-of-year financial report shows that Soros donated $86 million to organizations promoting voting rights, fighting global poverty and countering the influence of conservative forces. The rest is spread across a variety of other causes, such as the League for Security and Justice, the Voice of America's Families, the American Value Network, the Center for Community Change, freedom of the press, U.S. media affairs, and the National Partnership for Women and the Family. The Open Society Foundation, the charity of Soros' philanthropic empire, has been funding progressive political movements and organizations for years. But this new report records the largest ever donation, and the billionaire is pouring unprecedented amounts into American politics. Soros has long been the target of conservatives, who accuse him of trying to buy elections and influence public policy. The Hungarian-born investor has consistently denied these claims, pointing out his philanthropy. Soros is one of America's most generous political donors. According to the Center for Responding to Politics, he has donated more than $26 million to political campaigns and other causes since 2000. The Open Society Foundation's contribution includes $21.7 million to the American Value Network, which works to promote progressive values and combat racism, gender discrimination and religious intolerance. Soros also contributed to organizations such as the La Raza National Council, which works to combat hate crimes and promote Latinos in the United States, and the National Immigration Justice Center, which provides legal representation for immigrants facing deportation. The Open Society Foundation report also shows that it has invested heavily in community organizations and voter education in 2020, with the foundation pouring millions of dollars into fighting for higher minimum wages, voter mobilization and other initiatives. When the report was released, Soros was investing heavily in U.S. politics, and his foundation worked with liberal groups such as the Center for American Progress and the Voice of America's Families. Soros is also seen as a major investor in legal efforts to overturn restrictive voting laws, a move that could change the balance of power in many states. The Open Society Foundation is not the only organization that Soros has generously donated in 2021. The billionaire has also donated tens of millions of dollars to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, including $4 million to the World Health Organization to support vaccine development and universalization. Soros' recent philanthropy may have been driven not only by his passion for political causes, but also by his potential economic gains. As he continues to invest in progressive causes, some speculate that the billionaire may be investing in stocks and funds that could benefit from the efforts of the organizations he supports. Soros' recent donation of nearly $140 million to political causes, both for political and economic reasons, clearly indicates that he is a major player in American politics. The Foundation's year-end report shows that Soros may continue to invest heavily in progressive causes in the coming years.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "In a world where terrorism and climate change increasingly threaten global mobility, the story of a mother surviving at sea after her family was trapped for a month is a remarkable proof of resistance and human will. In November, a storm swept 34-year-old Lucy Wilson and her family of four from their home in the Turks and Caicos Islands to Jamaica in the Caribbean. A few hundred miles from the nearest land, Wilson and her family were forced to survive on a small sailing boat, relying on supplies and prayers for help. \"I really thought I was going to die in that boat,\" said Wilson. \"I was scared and tired, but I didn't give up hope. We had to move on.\" When the family embarked on their voyage, they had enough food, water and fuel to sustain themselves for a few days. But as the wind and the tide affected them, they quickly became favored by the sea, with no engine pushing them forward. All they could do was wait and pray. They were assigned their supplies and managed to stay floating for nearly a month before arriving in the form of a passing sailboat. \"Our food and water are very low, but I believe we will do it,\" said Wilson. \"We have to keep telling ourselves that everything is going to be okay.\" As the family got closer to safety, they sent out a May signal in hopes of getting someone's attention, there were boats and medical supplies. The family was eventually rescued by a passing sailing ship, the crew of which consisted of an experienced sailor who had also gone through a similar journey. \"I thank the people who helped us every day, and the great stories of human resilience that have been shared along the way,\" Wilson said. This experience changed Wilson in ways she never expected. \"I used to think I couldn't get through tough times, but now I believe in the strength of myself and my family,\" she said. Wilson's story reminds us how humans can overcome huge obstacles and survive in some of the most extreme environments on Earth. For Wilson, this experience is also a powerful reminder of the importance of community. \"We shouldn't spend our lives alone, we should be dependent on each other, especially when needed,\" Wilson said. After their incredible journey, the Wilsons look to the future. They are currently planning to set up a foundation to help other families facing similar difficulties. \"This experience has taught me so much and inspired me to move forward,\" said Wilson. \"We have a second chance, and we want to help those in need.\" The Wilson family, with courage, confidence and a great deal of help, survived an unprecedented journey at all costs. Despite the painful experience, Wilson was determined to use it to bring hope to others. \"Whatever life throws at you,\" she said, \"you can get through it.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "In the wake of this week's unprecedented wave of U.S. flight cancellations, experts and passengers alike are weighing in on how flyers can better prepare for a disrupted itinerary.\n\nWhile multiple explanations have been put forward to explain the chaos that stranded thousands of passengers in the last few days \u2014 the majority of which was led by Southwest Airlines and included weather, staffing and technology issues \u2014 there should be one key takeaway, experts say: Flyers can no longer rely on their airline when something goes awry, and instead should have the savvy and, where possible, the financial resources to take matters into their own hands.\n\n\"The days are gone when you could just take off without a backup plan,\" said Kathleen Bangs, a former commercial airline pilot and spokeswoman for FlightAware, a company that provides flight-tracking services.\n\nFirst, all travelers should download their airline's digital app, or get familiar with sites like Google Flights, in the event they must look for an alternative flight, she said. Some airlines, including Southwest, no longer have automatic agreements in place that allow for rebooking on another airline free of charge, she said.\n\nAnd because of consolidation within the industry, there are fewer planes flying overall, leaving many passengers with generally fewer options, said Scott Mayerowitz, the executive editor of The Points Guy travel site. All the more important, then, to know how to quickly look up alternatives in a pinch.\n\nThe image of seemingly endless lines of passengers waiting to speak with a rebooking agent should also cement the idea that air passengers must be the masters of their own fate, and can do so through a mobile device.\n\nRebooking online saved passenger Ryan Mitchell. He and his family spent Christmas in Austin, Texas, and intended to fly home to Raleigh, North Carolina, on Dec. 26 via Southwest. When their flight was canceled, he decided to drive to the airport to rebook after not being able to reach a Southwest representative by phone \u2014 not realizing a nationwide fiasco was unfolding.\n\nBy the time he got to the airport around noon, he said in an email, \"there was a line a thousand people long.\"\n\nImmediately, Mitchell said, he started looking on his phone for other options besides Southwest. He was able to find one on another airline for $350 leaving the same day.\n\n\"Bought it as fast as I could,\" he said. \"Checked prices a few hours later ... anything leaving Monday or Tuesday was in the thousands of dollars.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Southwest said customers affected by flight cancellations or significant flight delays from last Saturday and next Tuesday can submit receipts for consideration via email or on Southwest.com. It also posted a link to a refund request form.\n\nSouthwest executives said Thursday that anyone whose flight was cancelled is entitled to a full refund and that the airline would reimburse travel expenses, including tickets on other carriers, rental cars, gas, hotels and meals. Southwest will look at extenuating circumstances case by case. And it will pay for baggage to be shipped to the customer by FedEx or UPS or, in some cases, on a Southwest aircraft.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, the Transportation Department said it would use the fullest extent of its investigative and enforcement powers to hold Southwest accountable if the airline fails to adhere to the promises it made to compensate passengers.\n\nBut the Southwest executives said the reimbursement process could take several weeks.\n\nSo, experts say, flyers should also seriously consider budgeting additional financial resources in the event they must book a night at a hotel or rent a car.\n\nStranded Southwest Airlines passengers looks for their luggage at Chicago Midway International Airport on Wednesday. Kamil Krzacynski / AFP via Getty Images\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do if the airline can\u2019t save you?\u201d Bangs said. \u201cYou have to have the financial resources to get a backup ticket on another airline.\u201d\n\nIf possible, Mayerowitz also recommends keeping \"a diverse stash\" of points and frequent flyer miles across airlines and hotel vendors. Certain credit cards allow users to easily build them up.\n\n\"If you have a last-minute funeral, miles can help,\" he said. \"If hotel rooms are outrageously overpriced, points can help you. So everyone should have an emergency fund, but it should be in points and miles.\"\n\nBangs said situational awareness is also important. Keeping an eye on weather forecasts that may affect your travel plans, and also what alternative destinations may be within reasonable driving distance.\n\nShe bemoaned what she called the \"learned helplessness\" many flyers now experience when they arrive at an airport.\n\n\"It can feel like you're trapped in a netherworld, but you\u2019re not,\" Bangs said. \"You need to be proactive on your own behalf.\"\n\nAt least one passenger said she is now rethinking holiday travel altogether. Sallyann Koontz got stuck in Austin after her Southwest Airlines flight home to Charleston, South Carolina, was canceled. She said she would have already rebooked on another airline but found ticket prices had become too expensive \u2014 despite price caps meant to ease the burden on travelers.\n\nNext year, she said in an email, she'll plan differently when it comes to Southwest.\n\n\"It has served the public with affordable flights and possibly allowed travel for less affluent families for decades,\" Koontz said of the airline. \"I would still use them but maybe I would completely avoid holiday travel or believe the horrific weather predictions and cancel my travel plans.\"", "label": "human"}

The two had begun a romantic relationship after they met on the dating app, according to a probable cause statement. At Mills' apartment, he promptly tried to have sex with the woman, who denied his advances, court records said.\n\n\u201cHe immediately began to physically assault her and would not let her leave the residence,\u201d the probable cause statement said. The woman told authorities that when Mills got tired of hitting her with a \u201cclosed fist,\u201d he would \u201cgrab a screwdriver and would strike her with the handle.\u201d\n\nDuring her five days captive, Mills did not provide her with any food or water, the probable cause statement said.\n\nShe was able to escape from the apartment when Mills left to visit his father.

But his $108,100 student-debt balance is continuing to hold him back.\n\nWhen Crocker, now 37, started his education at the School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University, he did not anticipate the economic recession he was graduating into in 2008. He was unable to land a job using his bachelor's degree, and right out of college he moved to Pennsylvania and began working two jobs \u2014 one at Jimmy John's and one at Olive Garden.\n\nDuring that time, he was able to keep up with his $540 monthly student-debt payment. When it doubled to $1,089 a month once his graduation-repayment plan ended, the only option available to Crocker that would decrease his monthly payment was to extend the time it would take to pay the balance off. Crocker knew something had to give.\n\n\"I was tired of throwing away half of my income on rent and not being able to save a dime in the process,\" Crocker told Insider. \"So I decided to build out a school bus.\"\n\nThe inside of Nick Crocker's bus he built out for himself. Nick Crocker\n\nSince October 2018, Crocker and his fianc\u00e9e have been living in a 120-square-foot school bus he spent $25,000 to renovate. He pays around $550 a month to rent out a backyard parking space in Portland, Oregon. Even with those extra savings from rent payments, Crocker defaulted on some of his student loans because he was not making sufficient income to afford basic necessities alongside his student-loan bills. He's only continued to make payments on a loan that his father cosigned to ensure his dad wouldn't be impacted by a potential default.\n\nMeanwhile, President Joe Biden's student-loan forgiveness plans are facing challenges. After Biden announced up to $20,000 in debt relief at the end of August for federal borrowers, conservative lawsuits arose seeking to block the relief, and two federal courts have so far blocked it from being implemented.\n\nThe Education Department has appealed those decisions, but the relief remains on hold for the time being.\n\nWith the majority of Crocker's debt being private loans, Biden's relief won't make a significant dent for him and about 3 million other borrowers with private loans. He says he wishes he'd known the high, life-long costs of higher education when he was in high school. It may have prevented him from being in his current situation.\n\n\"While college was a great way for me to figure some things out, it was a really expensive way for me to do that,\" Crocker said. \"I wouldn't do that again. I would have gone into the trades. The student-loan debt is by far my biggest regret \u2014 it's too much money to let somebody borrow at 18 years old.\"\n\n'We're not getting out from underneath this'\n\nThe reason the majority of Crocker's student debt is held privately is because when he was applying for federal financial aid in high school, his parents' income was high enough that they only qualified for limited aid. Still, he needed funds because he was responsible for some of the expenses, and private student loans were readily available, so Crocker turned to those \u2014 but later found that the high interest rates on private loans make it difficult to touch the original balance borrowed.\n\n\"I wasn't chipping my way out of this,\" Crocker said. \"$540 a month was just covering interest, so at some point, we're not getting out from underneath this.\"\n\nBefore Crocker began falling behind on his monthly payments, he said he had a great credit score. After his loan company raised his monthly payment in 2015, his wages at his grocery-store job were garnished, so he picked up carpentry and other jobs on the side to keep up.\n\nNow, as an adventure-van builder making $25 an hour in Portland, he said he knows his current living situation is not sustainable in the long run. He will eventually need to face high rent prices and his six-figure student-debt load.\n\nAs Insider previously reported, average rent in the US has increased to $1,722 a month, which is more than 30% of the national median income, accounting for taxes. While mortgage debt is the largest form of consumer debt in the US, student debt follows right behind, currently totaling $1.7 trillion for over 40 million Americans. But while the Education Department oversees federal loans, private student loans can fly under the radar, which is why the department has taken actions to ensure private lenders don't steer students into unaffordable debt.\n\nThe Federal Student Aid office in March detailed requirements for colleges to better inform students about the risks of private student-loan options that can carry costly fees, writing in a blog post that \"the stakes could not be higher\" for students when they figure out how to pay for college.\n\nCrocker said he's \"on a savings plan right now\" by living in a bus, but wishes he'd gone to a trade school rather than take on student loans for a degree he couldn't use.\n\n\"I would love to be able to afford to buy a house, but right now it's not the best market to be buying a house,\" Crocker said. \"So we're living in a 120-square-foot school bus, and while it's been a great way for us to save the money, it's cramped.

The news caught the attention of governments and media around the world, who quickly learned that the group known as Wagner was supported by a shadowy figure named \"Putin Chef.\" Yevgeny Prigozhin is a billionaire businessman with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. While he denies any involvement in Wagner, the U.S. and other Western governments claim that he financed the group's activities and acted as an intermediary between the Kremlin and Ukrainian, Syrian and Libyan mercenaries. Now, as the 2022 U.S. midterm elections draw near, Prigozin and his Wagner group are once again in the international spotlight. Last week, the U.S. government accused Prigozin of leading an election-interfering campaign and spreading false information across the country through online and traditional media. The United States has long suspected Russian interference in American politics, but this is the first time that it has directly linked Prigozin to these activities. Prigozin and his company were accused by a grand jury of interfering in the 2016 presidential election, and the U.S. government is reportedly considering new sanctions against him. So who is Yevgeny Prigozhin, and why does the U.S. government accuse him of interfering in American elections? Here's a look at the businessman and his relationship with the Kremlin and Wagner Group. Life and careers Yevgeny Prigozin was born in Russia in 1961, one of six children. As an entrepreneur, he grew rich mainly through the catering and food-related business, he also owns several media outlets and has connections with many other businesses. Although Prigozin has built a business empire, his close relationship with the Kremlin is key to his success. His catering business Concord has been involved in several major government projects, including catering services for Putin's official residence and meals for the military and students. In 2013, Prigozin was appointed head of the Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation, a government agency responsible for monitoring Russian exports of weapons and military equipment. Wagner Group In 2014, Russia's offensive against Ukraine exposed the existence of a secret Russian paramilitary group called Wagner. Although it is not clear when it was formed, Wagner is believed to be headed by Prigozin and allegedly funded by his company. It is estimated that the organization has about 2,500 personnel and is believed to operate in countries such as Syria, Ukraine, Libya, the Central African Republic and Sudan. Wagner is also thought to be involved in providing private security services to the Syrian government. The group is known for its atrocities and has been accused of committing war crimes in Ukraine and Syria. It was also linked to several assassination attempts, including the attempted murder of a former Chechen rebel leader in Georgia in 2017. Russia gets into trouble in U.S. midterm elections The U.S. government has long suspected Russian interference in its elections and other political activities, but the recent allegations against Prigozin are the first time that the United States has directly linked him to these activities. The U.S. government has accused Prigozin and his company of leading a multimillion-dollar campaign to intervene in the 2022 midterm elections and spread false information in the United States, which allegedly included funding fake news websites, creating online personalities to spread pro-Russian propaganda, and trying to influence American media. The U.S. government is also reportedly considering new sanctions against Prigozin and his company, including a travel ban and an asset freeze. II. Conclusions Yevgeny Prigozhin is a billionaire businessman with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. While he denies any involvement in Wagner, the U.S. and other Western governments claim that he financed the group's activities and acted as an intermediary between the Kremlin and Ukrainian, Syrian and Libyan mercenaries. The U.S. government has long suspected Russian interference in its elections and other political activities, but the recent accusations against Prigozin are the first time that the United States has directly linked him to these activities. According to reports, the U.S. government is considering new sanctions against Prigozin and his companies. For now, only time will tell how the United States and Russia will respond to this news and its possible impact on future U.S.-Russian relations.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Gregg Berhalter said Thursday that he would \"like to continue in my role\" as U.S. men's national team head coach.\n\nBerhalter's contract expired on Dec. 31. U.S. Soccer is currently reviewing his performance over the past four years, and specifically at the 2022 World Cup. The review has been complicated by an investigation into a decades-old domestic violence incident involving Berhalter and his now-wife, Rosalind. The incident was brought to U.S. Soccer officials by the parents of midfielder Gio Reyna amid friction between Berhalter and Gio.\n\nWith the investigation and the review both ongoing, U.S. Soccer tabbed Anthony Hudson, one of Berhalter's assistants, to take charge of the USMNT at a January training camp. But U.S. Soccer sporting director Earnie Stewart confirmed Wednesday that Berhalter remains \u201cunder consideration\u201d for the job going forward, pending the investigation.\n\nGregg Berhalter claps to fans after the USMNT's World Cup Round of 16 loss to the Netherlands. (AP Photo/Francisco Seco)\n\nBerhalter addressed and detailed the early-'90s domestic violence incident in a Tuesday statement. On Thursday, he gave his first media interview since the World Cup to the Harvard Business Review, via LinkedIn. When asked about the Reyna saga, he said his \"entire family is saddened by these events.\"\n\n\"The worst part of it for me is, my heart aches for my wife,\" he said. \"Because it was her story to tell, if she chose to or not.\"\n\nInstead, when Danielle and Claudio Reyna, Gio's parents, brought the decades-old incident to Stewart on Dec. 11, Stewart was obligated to report it. U.S. Soccer hired a law firm to investigate it. That prompted Berhalter to publicly disclose it for the first time.\n\n\"I feel tremendously bad that my profession had to bring this to the public light,\" Berhalter said Thursday.\n\nIn the Tuesday statement, which was signed by both Gregg and Rosalind, Gregg wrote that, a few months into their relationship, while in college at the University of North Carolina, they were \u201cout drinking at a local bar\u201d when they \u201chad a heated argument that continued outside. It became physical and I kicked her in the legs.\" (Danielle Reyna said Wednesday that Gregg's description \"significantly minimize[d] the abuse on the night in question.\")\n\nStory continues\n\nGregg and Rosalind later reconciled, got married in the late '90s, and have four kids. Berhalter said Thursday that their relationship remains \"a loving relationship, a devoted relationship.\" After feeling the need to unearth the decades-old trauma, he said the family is \"taking it one day at a time, and moving forward.\"\n\nHe had agreed to Thursday's Harvard Business Review interview long before the saga burst into public view on Tuesday and Wednesday. \"We committed to doing this before all this stuff happened, and I wasn't gonna back down from it, because I said I would do it,\" Berhalter said, and then he answered questions for 30 minutes.\n\nWhen asked whether he'd like to continue as USMNT head coach over the next four years, he said:\n\n\"It's a fantastic group of players. A super high potential in this group. And we're competing in the World Cup in North America in 2026. So it would be an amazing challenge for this team.\n\n\"When we started in 2018, we wanted to change the way the world views American soccer. And I think when you ask around the world now about our team, the world sees us in a completely different light. But now it's about being able to take that next step. And that next step is doing something that no U.S. team has ever done, and that's get to the semifinals and see what happens from there.\n\n\"So there's a lot of great challenges involved. And of course I'd like to continue in my role.\"\n\nHe also addressed his early December comments that led Danielle Reyna to speak to Stewart. At a HOW Institute leadership conference that Berhalter thought was \"off the record,\" he spoke about how he almost sent an unnamed USMNT player home from the World Cup in Qatar. His comments were erroneously published by the Charter newsletter. Media reports soon revealed that the player whom Berhalter had described was Gio Reyna.\n\nWhen asked Thursday whether he had any regrets, Berhalter said, in part: \"If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't have told that story [about the unnamed player at the HOW event]. It brought too much unwarranted attention to an overall shining example of team culture and teamwork. So that would be something that I would go back and change, for sure.\"\n\nHis interviewer, Adi Ignatius, said multiple times that the roughly 200 people in the room at the HOW conference \"all walked away not even thinking about individual players or anything like that. ... I listened to you talk, you didn't throw any of your players under the bus.\"\n\nIgnatius also opened the interview by describing the subsequent saga as: \"Berhalter's decision to limit the playing time of one of his young players prompted the player's parents to try to blackmail him by threatening to expose an incident more than three decades ago where Berhalter and a woman got into a fight. This is the ultimate soccer mom nightmare.\"\n\nBerhalter never disputed nor corrected that characterization of the events.\n\nWhen asked, \"given what has happened with the Reynas,\" how he would go about rebuilding trust, Berhalter said:\n\n\"Trust is something that takes a long time to build, but can go away really quickly. What I would say is, you have to be consistent with who you are, and you have to have clear values. And if you are, people can see that, and they can trust that consistency.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "I've been traveling all over the world for a year, working in various party hotels, most of them in Europe. It's an unusual job, but I love every minute of it. I met some amazing people and had some incredible experiences, but it was also hard work. Every day, I get up early and clean rough rooms, organize events, run night bar crawls in exchange for a free place to stay. You have to be comfortable with a lot of noise and confusion, you need to be able to manage difficult situations. You also have to be one person - I spend most of my time interacting with guests, helping them find their way around the city, or making sure they're safe all night climbing bars. But despite the challenges, I won't trade it for any other job in the world. When I first came to a party hotel, I was a little nervous. This hostel is located in a touristy city, so I'm not sure if I'm suitable for accommodation. But once I settled down and started talking to other staff, I quickly felt at home. Everyone was very friendly and welcoming, which made the transition to my new job easier. The daily tasks of the party hotel may vary, but one of my main duties is to keep the room clean. I often change beds, wash clothes and clean the bathroom. It's a never-ending battle with dirt and dust, but it's a fight that I won! Once the rooms are cleaned up, I start organizing events and activities. I usually take care of booking tours, planning bar crawls, making promotional materials. This is hard work, but when I see our guests enjoying themselves, I always feel rewarded. Most people who work in party hostels are between the ages of 18 and 30, so we tend to get along very well. We are all motivated, passionate people who choose to do something different with our lives. Each of us has its own unique stories and experiences that make the workplace so interesting and dynamic. Of course, we like to have fun! Working in a party hostel means I'm always surrounded by those who are funny, adventurers, and who want to take full advantage of every day. The hardest part of working at a party hotel is trying to manage difficult guests. Because the purpose of the hostel is to cater to younger, more party-focused crowds, there may be some challenging situations. We have to deal with people who are drunk, unruly or disrespectful. However, in most cases, our guests are great people and we have had a good conversation with them. Finally, my experience working in a party hotel was very positive. I met some amazing people, created some lasting memories, and had the privilege of living in some incredible places. Moreover, I also made some money for my trip and saved a lot on accommodation. I will not exchange my experience for anything, I am happy to continue exploring and growing this incredible journey.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Anita Pointer, an influential R&B and soul singer, song creator and performer, and founder of the iconic pop trio \"The Pointer Sisters,\" passed away at the age of 74. Her public relations officer announced the death of a pointer on Tuesday, and the cause of death was not disclosed. \"I am very saddened to announce the death of my sister Anita Pointer,\" said Ruth Pointer, another founding member of the group. \"My heart is broken, she's my best friend and we talk every day. We have never fought a war in our lives, I can't believe she's gone.\" Anita Pointer and her sisters, Bonnie and Ruth, first found success in the early 1970s as the songs behind the trio \"Yes We Can\", \"Fair\" and \"Fire\". The three sisters, daughters of jazz singer Sarah Elizabeth Poole and minister Elton Pointer, introduced them to music. In 1969, the three sisters formed The Pointer Sisters (The Pointer Sisters) and released their debut album Fairytale. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the three continued to produce music, releasing a series of hit singles and albums, and becoming the first to receive \"Yes, we can\" on the Billboard Hot 100. In addition to their musical success, the sisters are also known for their unique and bold stage performances. They are often credited with helping bridge the gap between different music genres, including everything from R&B, Soul, Funk, Rock and Country. In 1983, Anita Porter performed and recorded an album with her sisters when she left the band to pursue a personal career. In the 1990s, she released three solo albums, including her highly regarded debut \"It's All About Me\". Despite her solo success, her career was hampered by the recognition of her sisters. As they continued to create music, Puncker's solo career was overshadowed by their well-known names and eventually came to an end. In 1994, Pointer reunited with her sister, and the trio released their album \"The Best Pointer Sisters.\" For the next two decades, they continued to tour and release albums \"Only Sisters Can Do It\" (2003) and \"Go Little Sister\" (2009). Most recently, in 2018, Anita Pointer and her sisters released their first ever Christmas album, \"Christmas in San Francisco.\" Anita Pointer will be known for her vocal range, fashion and contributions to music. \"My sister is a beautiful person who I miss every day.\" As a singer, she has a special talent that will remain in the hearts of everyone who loves music and all of us,\" Bonney said in a statement.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "The outlook for Ally Financial is more uncertain in 2023, according to Barclays. Analyst Jason Goldberg downgraded shares of Ally to equal weight from overweight, saying the bank is more vulnerable to a downshift in the economy. \"This year is likely to witness the end of the Fed tightening cycle and loan loss normalization,\" Goldberg wrote in a Tuesday note. \"As such, we are becoming less constructive on those with outsized asset sensitivity and areas we believe loan losses will adjust the fastest \u2013 namely, lower-end consumer (most impacted by much reduced stimulus, elevated inflation, and higher interest rates) and commercial real estate (uncertainties in office, retail, health care segments),\" Goldberg added.

Ally shares had their worst year on record in 2022, dropping 48.7%. The analyst lowered his price target to $33, down from $40, which implies nearly 35% upside from Friday's closing price. \"While ALLY should still be able to achieve a core ROTCE in the mid-double digits range over time, results in the near-term will likely be pressured due to the impacts of higher rates partially offset by continued loan growth,\" Goldberg wrote.

{"text": "The Oscar-winning actor brings a unique resonance, humor and occasional greed to his role as Otto. In this film, Otto is forced to confront his past by making an unlikely connection with a young woman named Scarlett Johansson. Now, 10 years after its release, the film is revisiting a new documentary, \"Look, I'm Selfish: Tom Hanks Gets Depressed in 'A Man Called Otto'.\" The paper, which premiered at the Cleveland International Film Festival earlier this year, takes a fresh look at Otto's story and characters, dives into their motivations, and explores themes of love, loyalty, and salvation. Look, I'm Selfish features interviews with Hanks and several actors and crew members, as well as original footage. But this documentary is more than just a review; it also provides an intimate look at the actor's process, as Hanks experienced his frustration and anxiety while rehearsing and working on the scene. In the film, Otto is a complex character who is struggling with inner demons and trying to find his place in the world.Hanks' performance managed to capture the character's vulnerability and pride, and in the documentary, the actor frankly describes his experience with the role. \"It's one of the most challenging roles I've ever done, and I know it's going to be like that,\" Hanks said. \"I have to face the shortcomings of this role but at the same time I have to find the courage to believe in him and give him a chance.\" The documentary also interviewed Silberlin and several other actors and crew members. Most notably, it showed the actor's experience in dealing with character emotions and motivations. \"It's intense, we've done a lot of work on the character, and I think the rehearsal process is very important to help us define the inner world of the character,\" Silberlin said. \"But in the end, it's everything Tom does. He's willing to go through all these dark places and explore Otto's anger, his injuries, and his vulnerability.\" Ultimately, Look, I'm Selfish is a fascinating exploration of the actor's process and a testament to Hanks' ability to perform. This documentary is a must-see for any fan of The Man Called Otto or anyone interested in acting skills. \"It was an incredible experience for me,\" Hanks said, \"I'm humbled by the reaction to this movie and I hope people can take something meaningful from watching it.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Prices of fruit and vegetables are on display in a store in Brooklyn, New York City, March 29, 2022. Andrew Kelly | Reuters\n\nGlobal markets have taken heart in recent weeks from data indicating that inflation may have peaked, but economists warn against the return of the \"transitory\" inflation narrative. Stocks bounced when October's U.S. consumer price index came in below expectations earlier this month, as investors began to bet on an easing of the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes. While most economists expect a significant general decline in headline inflation rates in 2023, many are doubtful that this will herald a fundamental disinflationary trend. Paul Hollingsworth, chief European economist at BNP Paribas, warned investors on Monday to beware the return of \"Team Transitory,\" a reference to the school of thought that projected rising inflation rates at the start of the year would be fleeting. The Fed itself was a proponent of this view, and Chairman Jerome Powell eventually issued a mea culpa accepting that the central bank had misread the situation. \"Reviving the 'transitory' inflation narrative might seem tempting, but underlying inflation is likely to remain elevated by past standards,\" Hollingsworth said in a research note, adding that upside risks to the headline rate next year are still present, including a potential recovery in China.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"Big swings in inflation highlight one of the key features of the global regime shift that we believe is underway: greater volatility of inflation,\" he added. The French bank expects a \"historically large\" fall in headline inflation rates next year, with almost all regions seeing lower inflation than in 2022, reflecting a combination of base effects \u2014 the negative contribution to annual inflation rate occurring as month-on-month changes shrink \u2014 and dynamics between supply and demand shift. Hollingsworth noted that this could revive the \"transitory\" narrative\" next year, or at least a risk that investors \"extrapolate the inflationary trends that emerge next year as a sign that inflation is rapidly returning to the 'old' normal.\" These narratives could translate into official predictions from governments and central banks, he suggested, with the U.K.'s Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) projecting outright deflation in 2025-26 in \"striking contrast to the current market RPI fixings,\" and the Bank of England forecasting significantly below-target medium-term inflation.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe skepticism about a return to normal inflation levels was echoed by Deutsche Bank. Chief Investment Officer Christian Nolting told CNBC last week that the market's pricing for central bank cuts in the second half of 2023 were premature. \"Looking through our models, we think yes, there is a mild recession, but from an inflation point of view,\" we think there are second-round effects,\" Nolting said. He pointed to the seventies as a comparable period when the Western world was rocked by an energy crisis, suggesting that second-round effects of inflation arose and central banks \"cut too early.\" \"So from our perspective, we think inflation is going to be lower next year, but also higher than compared to previous years, so we will stay at higher levels, and from that perspective, I think central banks will stay put and not cut very fast,\" Nolting added. Reasons to be cautious Some significant price increases during the Covid-19 pandemic were widely considered not to actually be \"inflation,\" but a result of relative shifts reflecting specific supply and demand imbalances, and BNP Paribas believes the same is true in reverse. As such, disinflation or outright deflation in some areas of the economy should not be taken as indicators of a return to the old inflation regime, Hollingsworth urged. What's more, he suggested that companies may be slower to adjust prices downward than they were to increase them, given the effect of surging costs on margins over the past 18 months. Although goods inflation will likely slow, BNP Paribas sees services inflation as stickier in part due to underlying wage pressures. \"Labour markets are historically tight and \u2013 to the extent that there has likely been a structural element to this, particularly in the U.K. and U.S. (e.g. the increase in inactivity due to long-term sickness in the UK) \u2013 we expect wage growth to stay relatively elevated by past standards,\" Hollingsworth said.\n\nwatch now\n\nChina's Covid policy has recaptured headlines in recent days, and stocks in Hong Kong and the mainland bounced on Tuesday after Chinese health authorities reported a recent uptick in senior vaccination rates, which is regarded by experts as crucial to reopening the economy. BNP Paribas projects that a gradual relaxation of China's zero-Covid policy could be inflationary for the rest of the world, as China has been contributing little to global supply constraints in recent months and an easing of restrictions is \"unlikely to materially boost supply.\" \"By contrast, a stronger recovery in Chinese demand is likely to put upward pressure on global demand (for commodities in particular) and thus, all else equal, fuel inflationary pressures,\" Hollingsworth said. A further contributor is the acceleration and accentuation of the trends of decarbonization and deglobalization brought about by the war in Ukraine, he added, since both are likely to heighten medium-term inflationary pressures. BNP maintains that the shift in the inflation regime is not just about where price increases settle, but the volatility of inflation that will be emphasized by big swings over the next one to two years. \"Admittedly, we think inflation volatility is still likely to fall from its current extremely high levels. However, we do not expect it to return to the sorts of levels that characterised the 'great moderation',\" Hollingsworth said.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Chief Justice John Roberts defended the judge's safety on Tuesday, calling it a \"necessary\" element of the country's court system and citing some threats in recent years. In a speech at the American Bar Association's annual meeting in San Francisco, Roberts acknowledged the risks associated with serving as a judge and described judges as \"an important part of our nation's judicial system.\" \"Judges serve their communities and countries, which depend on their ability to provide services without fear,\" said Roberts. \"Threats to judges and their safety must be taken seriously and protective measures taken when necessary.\" This comment comes after a number of recent incidents in which judges have been targeted by people who are dissatisfied with the court system. Last October, a man in Ohio was arrested for threatening to kill a judge who issued a ruling he disliked. In September, an Arizona man was arrested for threatening to kill three judges who overturned his conviction. In December 2014, two Colorado judges were killed by a person with a history of court complaints, highlighting these threats. In his speech, Roberts also discussed the importance of protecting the independence of the government's judiciary, which he said was threatened by the increasingly politicized courts. \"The independence of the judiciary must be safeguarded to ensure that judges serve without fear or favor, and are free from political influence or interference,\" Roberts said. He also urged the American Bar Association to help \"ensure that the decisions of judges and potential judges, as well as the court system they serve, are not influenced by partisan interests and are in the public interest.\" Roberts said there must be safeguards to protect the independence of the judiciary, including measures to ensure that judges are not affected by political, financial or any other interests. The Chief Justice also called on the Bar Association to establish a committee to help raise public awareness of the role and responsibilities of judges and the importance of their independence. \"All of us must understand the importance of judicial independence, and remember that judges serve the public and the interests of justice,\" Roberts said. The Chief Justice &apos; s comments come at a time of growing concern about judicial independence and security, following several high-profile incidents involving threats and violence against judges in recent years. In May, the Supreme Court issued a comprehensive opinion ruling that judges have a constitutional obligation to protect the public from threats and ensure the safety of those appearing in court. The Court held that it was the duty of judges to take reasonable measures to protect the physical integrity of Tribunal staff, visitors and other participants. In his speech, Roberts said he wanted to highlight the importance of judicial security and called on the Bar Association to help spread that message. \"I urge the American Bar Association to join me in raising awareness about the dangers faced by judges and the need to protect their safety,\" Roberts said. \"I call on all judicial personnel, including state and local courts, to take appropriate precautions.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Facial recognition technology has come under increasing scrutiny, as a recent case may have led to wrong arrests due to facial recognition tools used by Florida law enforcement agencies. The case involved a man from Florida who was arrested in September 2020 on suspicion of theft. According to the man's lawyer, the arrest was based on facial recognition technology that mistakenly identified the man as the perpetrator. Lawyer Justin Bentley said the man was arrested on the basis of images collected from surveillance videos of a suspected thief, which were then analyzed using facial recognition systems. However, according to Bentley, the image of the man's face did not fully match the suspect's face and the arrest was based on an incorrect match. Bentley said the man was detained for several days before charges were dropped and he is now suing the police department for damages. \"This case reminds us that it is dangerous to rely on facial recognition technology without proper safeguards,\" Bentley said. \"We must recognize the possibility of error and take steps to ensure that facial recognition technology is used in a responsible way, while establishing appropriate checks and balances.\" The case has raised new concerns about the accuracy of facial recognition systems, which law enforcement is increasingly using to identify suspects. In recent years, facial recognition systems have been heavily criticized for their potential misidentification and bias in determining matching. Critics of facial recognition technology say that these systems are prone to errors, and there is a lack of oversight by law enforcement on how they are used. They also argue that the system targeting people of color is being used disproportionately, which can lead to false arrests and unfair imprisonment. In the case of Florida, civil rights groups have called on law enforcement agencies to be more transparent in their use of facial recognition systems. These organizations have asked police departments to release information about how the system is used, how it identifies the man and what safeguards are in place to ensure accuracy. Facial recognition technology is becoming increasingly popular, and many businesses and law enforcement agencies are now using it to identify and track individuals. However, critics of the technology argue that more must be done to ensure its use in a responsible manner, and safeguards have been put in place to protect individuals from unlawful arrest. \"We must ensure that facial recognition technology is used in a way that respects human rights,\" Bentley said, adding: \"We must have strict laws and regulations in place to ensure that the technology will not be used recklessly or unfairly.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The 2020 outbreak has left a lasting mark on the world, and it will be felt by generations to come, especially in Thailand, an Asian country. According to a recent survey by the International Travel and Tourism Association (IATT), nearly 35% of people in the country say they will never travel again. The International Air Transport Association (IATT) surveyed 8,058 Thais of different ages and backgrounds and found that 34.6% of respondents said they would \"never travel again\" due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is far higher than the global average of 22% who said they would never travel again. In response to the findings, Edward Yee, Chief Executive Officer of the International Air Transport Association (IATT), said: \"It is very worrying to see the impact of the outbreak on people's willingness to travel. Thais are among those most likely to avoid travelling and this could have a significant impact on Thailand's tourism recovery.\" The survey also showed that the most commonly cited reasons for not wishing to travel again were health and safety concerns (74%), concern about COVID-19 infection (67%) and the economic impact of the epidemic (60%). The findings are consistent with a recent survey by Thailand's online travel company Triptoix, which found that 43% of Thai respondents do not plan to travel in 2021 and only 11% plan to travel abroad. To help reverse these negative trends, the Thai government has implemented a number of initiatives. These include a $2.8 billion tourism stimulus package and the establishment of Thailand's clean and safe corridor that allows travellers from low-risk countries to enter the country without quarantine. In the first quarter of 2020, tourist arrivals fell by 77% year-on-year, compared with 90% in the second quarter. This has had a devastating impact on the country's economy, which will shrink by as much as 8% by 2020. Clearly, the epidemic has left a lasting imprint on Thai people's attitude towards tourism, and the country will have to work hard to encourage people to start travelling again. However, if the right measures are taken, Thailand's tourism industry can successfully recover in the near future.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "2023 is our time to save the planet with a green economy. As climate change becomes a growing threat, the global community is under tremendous pressure to reverse the damage it has caused and find lasting solutions. After three decades of largely failed efforts to limit global warming, it's becoming increasingly clear that we need a new approach to tackling the climate crisis. Despite this, global average temperatures are still rising, sea levels have risen sharply, extreme weather events are becoming more frequent, and the number of endangered species is growing exponentially. The impact of climate change is now a reality, and the only way we can stop it from escalating is by placing greater emphasis on green economic growth. It involves investing in renewable energy, such as solar and wind, and abandoning fossil fuels that contribute the most to global warming. Moreover, it involves encouraging more efficient use of resources, such as reducing the use of plastics, developing more efficient modes of transportation, and investing in green technologies. A number of positive steps have been taken to promote global green economic growth, such as the European Green Deal, which aims to make the EU carbon neutral by 2050. Other countries have joined the fight, with China and India both pledging to cut emissions significantly over the next decade. Governments must invest in renewable energy, encourage more efficient use of resources, and focus on green technologies. Businesses must also play their part by investing in green technologies and developing more sustainable practices. The time has come to act, and 2023 will be the year we take a stand to save our planet. As individuals, governments, and businesses, it is our responsibility to ensure that we make the changes necessary to ensure a prosperous future for generations to come.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "For years, alcohol has been a part of my lifestyle. I am an extrovert who always finds it easy to socialize with a glass of beer or cocktails. Therefore, I have been looking for a way to reduce drinking and explore life without alcohol. The goal is to give my liver a break while trying out a new way of life. What I didn't realize was how different life would be without the puncture of alcohol. Can I have fun as much as I did before? Can I handle social activities as I did before? As it turns out, I will. Here's how I avoid alcohol for a month - and you can do that too. 1.Understand why you are doing this I don't want to do \"Dry January\" just for the sake of doing it - I want to make sure that I have a strong purpose in quitting alcohol. Why should I do this? What do I hope to get out of it? For me, it's challenging myself to see what life without alcohol looks like. I want to prove to myself that I can still have fun and socialize without having to drink. It's also a way to save money and start my health and wellness goals. Knowing my goals makes it easier to stay motivated and stick with the challenge. 2.Be honest with yourself and others When I tell people that I'm going to stop drinking, some of them are happy to join me, while others think I'm crazy. No matter what the answer is, I stick to my promise. I was also honest about my motives and expectations. I had to check in person to make sure I stayed on track. Find Other Ways to Socialize Since my friends and I usually get together for a drink, I have to find other ways of socializing. Instead of going to the bar, we go hiking, skating, going out for coffee or juice. We also play game nights at other people's homes, or participate in a wakeful party.There are plenty of awake activities such as lucid music festivals that are fun and social. 4. Focus on effectiveness It's hard to stay away from alcohol in social situations, but I keep reminding myself of its benefits.I'm saving money, sleeping better, and feeling more energetic.I also have more meaningful conversations because I'm not overwhelmed by alcohol. I also listed my favorite non-alcoholic beverages, such as Kombucha, ice tea and modular wine, so I always had something to order when I went out. 5. Seeking support I found that having a support system was very helpful for staying motivated. I contacted some of my friends who were doing \"Do January\" with me, and we checked the situation every week. We also reached an agreement that if one of us slipped off, we would all start over again. Celebrate your success. I've spent the whole month feeling very proud of myself. I celebrate it by writing down all the accomplishments I've made and all the benefits I've experienced that have helped me stay motivated and on my track. I'm also happy to know that I can actually be in social situations and still have fun without alcohol. This has made me realize that I can make meaningful connections with people and have fun without the need for alcohol. In general, doing January was a big challenge for me and it taught me a lot about myself. I still like to drink an occasional glass of wine, but this experience definitely changed my drinking habits. I am now more aware of when to drink and the benefits of choosing not to drink.I hope that my experience will help you if you are also trying to reduce your drinking.Good luck!", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "But even with the huge win in 2022, short sellers still lag in recent history. In the past five years, an average annual return for short sellers was a loss of 4.4% while the Dow gained 6.8%, the S&P 500 rose 9.3% and the Nasdaq climbed 12.5%.\n\nShorted stocks had a return of 30.8% in 2022, said Ihor Dusaniwsky, the firm's managing director of predictive analytics. That means short sellers outperformed the broader market, which suffered its biggest losses since 2008. The Dow Jones Industrial Average , S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lost 8.8%, 19.4% and 33.1%, respectively, last year.\n\nWhen an investor sells a stock \"short\" they borrow shares from a broker and sell them in hopes of buying the stock back later at a lower price. It's a tactic that does best when the broader market is hurting. Short seller returns came in below the major indexes when the market gained value in 2019 through 2021, but beat the averages when they ended the year down in 2018.\n\nIt's worth noting that the total amount shorted last year was below 2021, when the $1 trillion threshold was broken, but higher than in 2018 through 2020.\n\nShort sellers still needed to be good stock pickers in 2022 as different sectors and individual holdings could produce vastly different results, Dusaniwsky said.\n\nFor instance, the best sector to short last year was beat down communication services stocks, which produced a return on shorted holdings of 56.7%. Energy was the worst, and posted a 28% loss on shorted holdings, S3 Partners said.\n\nShort- and long-term performance are typically inversed. That's because investors usually move short on holdings that they expect to lose value, so energy \u2014 which was the only winning S&P 500 sector in 2022 \u2014 would not be a target for shorting as investors watched share values rise despite the broader market's decline.\n\nAnd choosing sector orientation is \"only half the battle\" given the variety of stocks within each one. Within consumer staples, for example, Beyond Meat had the biggest return on short selling at 128.2%. French fry producer Lamb Weston was the least profitable in its sector, and lost 43.9%.\n\nCarvana , which was beat down as used car demand slid, had the best short performance of all stocks with at least $100 million in short interest, recording a 377.6% gain.\n\nOn the flip side, Madrigal Pharma was the worst to short. Bets against the company lost 345.4%. The stock rallied in December on the back of well-received drug trial data.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "After a storm of snow swept across the state in California and Sierra Nevada, one of the highest snow capsules for the past 40 years is under way. Snowfall is expected to bring much needed relief to areas that have been devastated by drought over the past decade, while potentially posing a threat to people living in mountains. The U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) reported that a powerful storm passing through the state last week caused snow pack levels to rise, especially in half of the northern part of the state, including the Sierra Nevada. According to NWS, the latest snowbag survey shows an average of 134% in most parts of the Sierra Nevada. This is higher than the peak of 129% measured in December 2019 and the highest snowbag in 40 years. In recent weeks, as a series of powerful storms swept through the state and snow packs gradually increased, some areas received up to 10 feet of snow in just a few days. Precipitation and snowfall has been increasing in the Sierra Nevada region since October 2020, with the largest rainfall occurring since early 2021. California officials say the high snowfall is a positive signal for the state's overall water supply, as they expect it will lead to higher groundwater levels and more water entering the state's reservoirs. The Department of Water Resources says it wants snow packs \"to provide sufficient beneficial outflows in the state's basins and reservoirs, thereby strengthening the water supply that has been weak during the drought over the past decade.\" Snowbags are also good news for California's farmers and ranchers, who rely on seasonal streams to fill reservoirs and stimulate crops. State officials say snowbags should help relieve pressure on agricultural producers who have struggled in recent years to meet their water needs. However, high levels of snow may also pose some problems for the state, especially in mountain communities where avalanches and mud flows can be a danger. The California Forest and Fire Service said it was closely monitoring snow pack levels and warned residents in the Sierra Nevada mountains to exercise caution when outdoors in areas at risk from an avalanche. Snow packs are likely to continue to increase in the coming weeks, as more storms are expected to pass through the state. State officials say they will continue to monitor the situation closely and will take necessary precautions to keep people living in the Sierra Nevada safe.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nDemocratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, sworn in for a second term Sunday, called the sentencing last week of two men convicted of plotting to kidnap her \u201cjust,\u201d while urging both parties to confront threats and violent rhetoric.\n\n\u201cWhether it is someone harassing Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh or Congressman Fred Upton here in Michigan, or me, or our attorney general, or secretary of state, it\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins in an interview the day she was sworn in. \u201cBut I do think it\u2019s important that people on both sides of the aisle, who care more about our democracy than their political agenda, stand up and take it on.\u201d\n\nThirteen people were charged in the kidnapping plot, with the group discussing sending a bomb to the governor. The co-leaders of the plot were sentenced last week to 16 years and nearly 20 years in federal prison, respectively, after prosecutors had sought a life sentence in both their cases.\n\nWhitmer, who had dealt with an unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic and issued stay-at-home orders that made her a target, expressed concern over how the plot has been described, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s a tendency to minimize some of these threats.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t planning to ransom me, they weren\u2019t going to keep me, they were planning to assassinate me.

And so I think that when you look at the facts of both of those, and you see how differently they\u2019re covered, I do, you know, have concern about the language that we use, especially when women are a target as opposed to men.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department charged the man who was arrested near Kavanaugh\u2019s house in Maryland with attempting or threatening to kidnap or murder a US judge.\n\nWhitmer, first elected governor in 2018, said the threat against her had \u201cchanged how I assess going into situations\u201d and \u201cchanged my concern for all the people around me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would be lying if I told you I was unfazed,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI think it\u2019s important to understand, I\u2019m an ordinary person. I\u2019ve got an extraordinary job and have served in extraordinary times. I\u2019m a mom. I\u2019m a daughter.\u201d\n\nAfter the challenges of the past few years, Whitmer said she\u2019s \u201cexcited\u201d about starting a new term.\n\n\u201cThere was so much chaos, politically and in the environment, I didn\u2019t know if I would, you know, get an opportunity to serve for four more years,\u201d the Democratic governor said. \u201cI never imagined I\u2019d win by almost 11 points and come in with a whole new legislature.\u201d\n\nWhitmer sailed to a resounding victory in November, beating her Republican challenger Tudor Dixon 55% to 44%, while Democrats also won a majority in the Michigan legislature \u2013 giving them control of both chambers and the governorship for the first time in nearly four decades. Among her top priorities, Whitmer listed public education, economic development, protecting the Great Lakes and ensuring people have access to safe drinking water and high-speed internet. She also mentioned repealing the retirement tax that Republicans passed last legislature and getting a 1931 state law banning abortion \u201coff the books.\u201d\n\nWith her reelection in a pivotal swing state, Whitmer has furthered cemented her status as a national figure in the Democratic Party, but she has brushed off speculation about a 2024 White House bid while not completely closing the door to running for something else down the line.\n\n\u201cI think doing my job well is the best way that I can contribute to the national Democratic Party \u2013 is to be able to be someone that they can point to and say, \u2018This is what happens when you elect Democrats,\u2019\u201d she said, reflecting on how her 2022 campaign \u201ctalked about abortion in the most personal terms\u201d and how she thinks that contributed to Democrats\u2019 success.\n\nShe anticipates President Joe Biden running for the White House again in 2024, telling CNN that he would have her \u201centhusiastic support\u201d if he does.\n\n\u201cI do not have plans to run for anything other than to spend the next four years serving this state as governor with a majority Democratic legislature for the first time in a long time,\u201d Whitmer said, while also noting that she felt similarly when she left the state legislature in 2015, only later to run for governor in 2018.\n\n\u201cI know enough about myself to know if there is something that needs to get done, and if there\u2019s a role I can play, I will want to play it,\u201d she said.\n\nBut regardless of whether she runs for something again or not, Whitmer said she \u201cwill stay engaged one way or another,\u201d reflecting on what\u2019s to come after the governor\u2019s mansion. \u201cMichigan will always play an outsized role in the national politics, so I look forward to making sure that our voices are impactful and Michigan gets what we need and we\u2019ve got leaders who serve every person.\u201d", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Microsoft zou naar verluidt bezig zijn om AI-chatbot ChatGPT in zoekmachine Bing te integreren.\n\nDe chatbot van maker OpenAI wordt door experts al aangeduid als mogelijke bedreiging voor Google.\n\nHoe de integratie van ChatGPT zou moeten werken, is nog niet duidelijk.\n\nLees ook: ChatGPT is niet krachtig genoeg en veel te duur om de concurrentie met Google aan te gaan\n\nDe hype die momenteel gaande is rond de door kunstmatige intelligentie aangestuurde chatbot ChatGPT draait vooral om het feit dat experts denken dat deze applicatie mogelijk in de toekomst Google van de internettroon kan stoten.\n\nDe vragen die ChatGPT kan beantwoorden, zouden volgens sommigen een natuurlijker en beter alternatief zijn voor de zoekresultaten die Google ophoest.\n\nMogelijk ziet Microsoft die potentie ook, want volgens The Information zou de techgigant uit Redmond bezig zijn op de chatbot te integreren in zoekmachine Bing. Hoe dit precies moet gaan werken, is niet helemaal duidelijk, maar het is op zijn minst interessant te noemen.\n\nZeker omdat er ook veel tegenstanders zijn voor het gebruik van ChatGPT als vervanging voor de zoekfunctie van Google. Er zijn al ontelbaar veel voorbeelden op het internet verschenen waarin de chatbot foutieve informatie deelt alsof het de waarheid is.\n\nWaar Google bij een zoekvraag geen direct antwoord geeft, maar een selectie maakt van bronnen met links naar sites die mogelijk betrouwbare antwoorden kunnen geven, geeft ChatGPT zelf direct antwoorden zonder bronvermelding. ChatGPT maakt daarbij geen afweging tussen betrouwbare en dubieuze antwoorden.\n\nOok de CEO van OpenAI, maker van ChatGPT, zegt dat de chatbot niet geschikt is als alternatief voor internetzoekmachines. Al houdt hij natuurlijk een slag om de arm en zegt hij dat dit voor nu het geval is. In de toekomst zou het dus wellicht wel kunnen.\n\nReactie van Google?\n\nOf Google met een tweede 'Code Rood' reageert op dit nieuws, weten we nog niet. Duidelijk is wel dat het zoekmachinebedrijf naar verluidt alles op alles zet om eigen toepassingen van artificial intelligence aanzienlijk te verbeteren in de aankomende periode. Vooralsnog zou het bedrijf nog geen concurrent van ChatGPT willen introduceren uit angst voor reputatieschade.\n\nOf zoekmachine Bing van Microsoft met de integratie van ChatGPT ineens een geduchte concurrent wordt van Google, valt nog te bezien. Het marktaandeel van Google is 30 keer groter dan dat van Bing (90 procent versus 3 procent).\n\nDaarnaast werkt Google al jaren met kunstmatige intelligentie om de zoekresultaten te verbeteren. De antwoorden op zoekvragen worden ook gegenereerd met behulp van kunstmatige intelligentie. Alleen verwijst Google hierbij naar de geselecteerde bron, in plaats van dat de software een antwoord in eigen woorden omschrijft.\n\nDe mogelijke integratie van ChatGPT in Bing is niet heel erg verrassend, gelet op de banden tussen softwaregigant Microsoft en startup OpenAI. Niet alleen draait ChatGPT voor een prikkie op Azure-servers van Microsoft, ook ontving de startup investeringen van in totaal 1 miljard dollar van Microsoft. Daarnaast gebruikt Microsoft al toepassingen die zijn ontwikkeld door OpenAI in onderdelen van het Windows-besturingssysteem.", "label": "human"}

Firing it, The Times reported, costs $500,000.\n\nBut Mathieu Boul\u00e8gue, a Russia expert at London's Chatham House, told the newspaper that the cost was \"irrelevant as long as the West keeps providing military assistance to Ukraine.\"\n\nIn December, the US announced it would send its most advanced missile-defense system, the Patriot, to Ukraine.\n\nBut officials have said this is no silver bullet \u2014 precisely because of the cost difference between launching a cheap Iranian drone and defending against it with a top-of-the-line Patriot missile.\n\nMark Cancian and Tom Karako, military experts at the Center for Strategic and International Studies \u2014 who priced the Shahed drone at about $50,000, rather than $20,000 \u2014 wrote about the issue in December: \"High-value Russian aircraft and ballistic missiles would be appropriate targets.\n\n\"Shooting $4 million missiles at $250,000 Russian cruise missiles might be justified if those missiles would hit sensitive targets.

{"text": "NEW YORK, Dec 23 (Reuters) - A rough year for U.S. stocks is winding down, but the market\u2019s pain may be far from over, as investors brace for an expected recession in 2023.\n\nWith only a handful of trading days left in 2022, the benchmark S&P 500 index (.SPX) is down 19.8% year-to-date and headed for its biggest annual decline since 2008, as the Federal Reserve mounts its most aggressive monetary policy tightening cycle in decades to fight surging inflation.\n\nWhile inflation is yet to be tamed, Wall Street's focus is shifting to the potential consequence of the Fed\u2019s rate hikes: a 2023 economic slowdown.\n\nFirms projecting at least a mild recession include BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, Barclays and Oxford Economics. Fund managers in a BofA Global Research survey named a deep global recession and persistently high inflation as the market\u2019s biggest risks, with a net 68% forecasting a downturn as likely in the next year.\n\nRecession worries are also filtering into asset prices, while the Treasury yield curve has been inverted since early 2022, a signal that has preceded past downturns.\n\n\"The consensus is pretty clear that there is going to be a recession in 2023,\" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services. \"The issue is how much has the market already discounted a recession, and that\u2019s where it gets a little bit thornier.\"\n\nConcerns that the Fed will maintain its hawkish stance helped drive the S&P 500 down 1.45% on Thursday.\n\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research, the official arbiter of recessions, typically declares them in hindsight, and consistent job growth this year makes it less likely that a recession has already started.\n\nIf a recession starts next year, stocks could be set for another swoon: A bear market has never bottomed before the beginning of a recession, historic data showed.\n\n\"If we\u2019re not in a recession now but we\u2019re going into one that would mean that a retest of the October lows and a break of them is quite possible in the first half of the year,\u201d said Ed Clissold, chief U.S. strategist at Ned Davis Research.\n\nThe S&P 500 marked a 2022 closing low of 3,577.03 in October, just over 6% below its current level.\n\nStocks perform poorly during economic downturns, with the S&P 500 falling an average of 29% during recessions since World War Two, according to Truist Advisory Services. The index was down just over 25% in October from its Jan. 3 record closing high.\n\nStocks could also see a bigger move than usual next year. The S&P 500 has swung by at least 10% in either direction in the year after a decline of 15% or more, according to Bespoke Investment Group.\n\nReuters Graphics\n\nEARNINGS OVERESTIMATED?\n\nInvestors are also gauging to what degree slowing growth has been factored into corporate earnings.\n\nConsensus analyst estimates project S&P 500 earnings to rise about 5% in 2023, and to post at least a slim year-over-year gain in every quarter next year, according to Refinitiv IBES.\n\nYet earnings fall by an average annual rate of 24% during recessions, according to Clissold, leaving plenty of downside for profits if a slowdown hits.\n\n\u201cStocks generally follow earnings,\" said Matt Peron, director of research at Janus Henderson Investors. \u201cIf rate hikes take about a year to flow through the system, we are still six months away from the real teeth of it.\u201d\n\nOne wild card may be whether consumer prices, which rose less than expected in November for a second straight month, subside quickly enough to allow the Fed to stop raising rates as soon as Wall Street anticipates.\n\nWhile many investors believe rates will peak sometime in the middle of 2023, policymakers earlier this month said the benchmark interest rate will need to rise next year to a higher level than previously anticipated to cool consumer prices.\n\n\u201cThe market focus is shifting from inflation concerns to growth concerns,\u201d said Mona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones. \"If there are any inflationary shocks that are unforeseen, that will derail the narrative.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, strategists polled by Reuters last month expect the S&P 500 to end 2023 at 4,200, some 10% above current levels.\n\nOne way that could happen is if a recession hits early in 2023 and ends quickly. Bear markets on average have bottomed four months before the end of a recession, according to Clissold, of Ned Davis.\n\nIf a recession finishes by the end of 2023, \u201cby the time we get into the second half of the year, we could be looking at a new bull market,\u201d he said.\n\nReporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Leslie Adler\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "label": "human"}
{"text": ".. As cars become increasingly connected and rely on data from the cloud, buying a car will never go back in time. This change will have a major impact on how people buy vehicles and how car dealers operate. In the past few decades, the process of buying cars has remained unchanged. Typically, customers have to go to a dealer for a test drive, negotiate purchase and price, and then bring their car home. Over the past few years, this process has been changing due to the influx of technology and data. For example, many automakers now offer apps that allow customers to find, research and compare car models. That means customers can shop before entering a dealership and get the best price possible. The rise of electric vehicles and autonomous driving has also had an impact on the car buying process, with more people opting for EVs that require less maintenance than conventional gasoline cars. Data obtained from EVs can also be used to help auto companies better understand their customers' preferences and driving habits. In some cities, self-driving cars are even tested on public roads. This shift in technology is prompting car companies to rethink how they do business. Another way to change the car buying process is using artificial intelligence (AI). AI can advise customers based on their preferences, budget and lifestyle, predict the best price, and even negotiate on their behalf. Customers can now rent cars for a short or long term, rather than buying them directly. This type of model allows consumers to get the car they want without worrying about the upfront cost of purchasing it. Automobile companies have begun to focus on online business and customer service in order to attract customers and get them back. They are also investing heavily in technologies such as artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, and subscription models to ensure they remain competitive. Obviously, the process of buying cars is changing dramatically and it seems that it will never return to normal. In order to remain relevant in the future, automotive companies must embrace new technologies and innovations.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Sandy Anuras, the chief technology officer of Sunrun. Photo courtesy Sandy Anuras, the chief technology officer of Sunrun\n\nTech workers are walking away from high-paying jobs with great perks to help fight what they believe is the greatest existential problem of our lifetimes: climate change. In some cases, that has meant taking a pay cut. But Sandy Anuras, who recently joined home solar provider Sunrun as its chief technology officer, says a big paycheck sometimes comes with a price. \"The tech giants have had these huge compensation packages. And it's hard to say no to a huge compensation package,\" Anuras told CNBC. \"You just realize there's a little bit more to life than maxing out your comp package. And I think people are realizing that now \u2014 and especially with some of the decisions that their companies have made to prioritize profits over democracy, for example.\" Before starting at Sunrun in March, Anuras worked at Expedia for almost three years. She believes traveling is good for society, as people who travel often experience an expanded perspective and greater compassion toward strangers. But helping people book travel efficiently did not give Anuras the internal satisfaction she had when she worked at Blokable, a startup working to make affordable housing readily available.\n\nThere's a little bit more to life than maxing out your comp package. And I think people are realizing that now. Sandy Anuras Chief Technology Officer, Sunrun\n\nWhen Anuras started looking for new jobs, she wrote an \"intention document\" expressing her desire to work at a mission-first company. \"What bigger problem is there to solve for our generation than climate change?\" Anuras found herself thinking. Not only is climate change an existential-level threat to humanity, it is especially dangerous for the poorest communities around the world. \"Spending my time in that space is just so important,\" she said. That's how it was for software engineer Tom Melendez, too. He worked at Google for five years before leaving in 2019 to take a job at MethaneSAT, an affiliate of the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, which processes satellite data to measure emissions of methane, an especially potent greenhouse gas. \"I was proud to be at Google. While I was there, especially in the beginning, I enjoyed the work I was doing,\" Melendez told CNBC. But eventually he started to feel disenchanted. \"At the end of the day, you can't help but feel like the sole purpose of this is really just to make money. I am not making anything better \u2014 or not really. The metrics that I'm rated on are important to the company, but they're not really important to me.\" He has two kids who are now 12 and 16 years old and he thinks about what he's leaving the next generation. \"I genuinely am afraid of the world that we're leaving these folks and what can I do to help? And me pushing bytes around at Google\" was not it, he said. Google declined to comment.\n\nTom Melendez, the senior engineering director at MethaneSAT, and his son, Jaxon. Photo courtesy Tom Melendez\n\nBefore he was employed at Google, Melendez worked with satellite data at a startup, Skybox Imaging. That experience helped him land his current gig, but he hasn't always thought of himself as a climate warrior. \"I didn't necessarily grow up as an environmentalist, or anything like that. I was just trying to live my life,\" he told CNBC. He grew up in a working class, politically purple part of Long Island, New York, where his family and friends saw environmental regulations as a nuisance that increases complexity and costs for businesses. Melendez wanted to help give people like his childhood peers the data and tools to process the facts on their own. \"I do feel a need to be able to turn this data into something that everybody can understand and not be so afraid of,\" Melendez said. \"I've put effort into this in my current work of \u2014 how to make this consumable to those folks that I grew up with? How do I get them to understand that this is a problem?\"\n\nEventually, it just got to the point where I couldn't justify to myself why I'm still doing something that isn't climate. Eugene Kirpichov Founder and CEO, Work On Climate\n\nBecause he had earned a high Google salary for years and owned his home, he was financially able to take the step-down in pay that came with his move to MethaneSAT. Having a steady housing situation ends up being a key factor in whether people can move to a lower salary in exchange for work they find meaningful.\n\nHelping disgruntled techies make the jump\n\nAs more techies consider jumping to careers fighting climate change, resources are popping up to help them make the switch. For example, since the climate jobs website Climatebase launched in June 2020, more than 600,000 people have used it, poring over more than than 40,000 job listings from more than 3,000 climate tech companies and environmental organizations, according to co-founder Evan Hynes. Climatebase has also had over 3,000 applications for an educational fellowship the company runs. (Disclosure: I was one of the fellows in the founding fellowship earlier in 2022.) Work On Climate, a non-profit working to help people find jobs in climate, has a Slack channel with more than 10,000 members, up more than fourfold in the last year, said the list's co-founder, Eugene Kirpichov.\n\nEugene Kirpichov, co-founder and CEO of Work on Climate Photo courtesy Eugene Kirpichov, co-founder and CEO of Work on Climate\n\nBefore launching Work On Climate, Kirpichov was employed at Google for eight years, where he worked on big data and machine-learning systems. He liked his job there. \"Academically, it was fascinating, super interesting problems, really great colleagues,\" he told CNBC. Then Kirpichov watched the documentary \"An Inconvenient Truth\" on a plane flight, and was engrossed enough to watch the sequel, \"An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power\" on the flight back. He educated himself about the topic further by asking questions of people who knew more about climate change than he did, friends who are environmental scientists and energy scientists, and reading books. \"Eventually, it just got to the point where I couldn't justify to myself why I'm still doing something that isn't climate,\" Kirpichov told CNBC. \"It got me into a pretty anxious and unsettled state.\" Kirpichov decided to leave Google to pursue work full time on climate and he shared the email he wrote to colleagues on LinkedIn: \"The reason I'm leaving is because the scale, urgency and tragedy of climate change are so immense that I can no longer justify to myself working on anything else, no matter how interesting or lucrative, until it's fixed,\" Kirpichov wrote. \"I'd be lying if I didn't say that I think others, who have the privilege of being able to do so, should follow suit. I like to frame the problem positively as 'how much can we save,' and every one of us can have a hand in saving something.\"\n\nResponse to the letter was effusive. \"It turns out that there are just so many people who are in the same boat,\" Kirpichov told CNBC. While many people shared a similarly urgent desire to work in climate, they didn't know what exactly they could do. \"Most people still think that working in climate is calling your representatives and walking around with strongly worded banners,\" he said. Hearing the feedback helped Kirpichov realize there was a need to help other people find jobs in the space. James Newsome, now chief data officer at carbon accounting software company Persefoni, was one of those people who didn't know whether or how his skill set could translate to a climate job.\n\nJames Newsome, Chief Data Officer, Persefoni Photo courtesy James Newsome, Persefoni\n\n\"When I was growing up in the '90s, early 2000s, the only people you saw in climate were these climate scientists with Ph.D.s,\" Newsome told CNBC. So when Kentaro Kawamori, co-founder and CEO of Persefoni, approached Newsome and told him about building a climate disclosure SaaS platform, Newsome's response was: \"Well, I think it's awesome. But I'm not a climate scientist.\" Kawamori told him, \"This is a data problem that we're solving.\" And Newsome definitely knows data. \"Back in 2006, I just wanted to trade stocks. Warren Buffett was somebody I admired,\" Newsome told CNBC. He started reading about people who use quantitative analysis to trade stocks, \"with some magical algorithm\" and was sure that he was onto the wave of the future. He had graduated with a masters in accounting from the University of Phoenix but started studying statistics, mathematics and computer science on his own time. He worked at Insight, an IT services and consulting company, for six years and ended up running the business intelligence group there, which included both data science and data engineering. \"I definitely enjoyed it,\" Newsome said, but after a while he started to lose his passion for the work. \"You kind of start feeling like a factory,.\" Now, working at Persefoni gives Newsome a newfound sense of purpose, letting him align his personal values with his work values. As an executive responsible for hiring and inspiring, he's found a lot of other tech workers craving the same kind of change. Since starting with Persefoni in 2020, Newsome has hired about 40 engineers, and he's been able to compete for talent with the top tech companies. \"This is a wildly sought after skill set. You have Google, Amazon paying people $300,000 a year,\" Newsome said.\n\nBrian Lafayette, head of business strategy at Overstory Photo courtesy Brian Lafayette\n\n'There's starting to be almost a playbook now'\n\nThat kind of skill set translation brought Brian Lafayette to Overstory, a tech startup that uses satellite data to monitor vegetation growth. Overstory's technology is used by the Rainforest Alliance to monitor forest growth and utility companies concerned about electric wires running through dry leaves and causing wildfires. Lafayette grew up in Burlington, Vermont, with a forest in the backyard, a lake at the bottom of the street and not a whole lot of big business around. His goal, however, was to work for the kind of business that changes the way people live and work. \"Doesn't everybody want to work in tech?\" he asked a bit rhetorically, in a conversation with CNBC. So after working in management consulting, he landed a job at event planning platform Meetup in 2014. There, he climbed the ranks from running the data analysis and strategy team to becoming the vice president of revenue, where he was part of the team that helped sell the company to WeWork. But as WeWork started imploding, Meetup (among many other divisions of the company) had to lay off significant portions of the staff. Those kind of layoffs create a \"massive hit\" to morale. \"It just feels terrible,\" Lafayette told CNBC. He knew it was time to move jobs.\n\nThere's just no bigger problem in the world than climate change. It's the defining problem of our generation. Brian Lafayette Head of business strategy, Overstory\n\nOne thing that Lafayette learned at Meetup was the joy of working for a company that makes the world better in some way -- in that case, helping people find community was a way to help make people happier. \"I couldn't go work for a startup that was building something in the marketing stack. I can't get excited about that,\" Lafayette said. When he stepped back to assess his next step, he had the same realization as many others who have made the jump: \"There's just no bigger problem in the world than climate change,\" he told CNBC. \"It's existential.\" When he was ready to make the move to a climate startup, Lafayette reached out to a friend in his network who had previously made a similar transition. \"There's starting to be almost a playbook now,\" Lafayette said. \"I talked to somebody who had already done it before, she helped me and showed me all the different resources that were available.\" His friend also talked him out of going back to school before making the switch. Instead, Lafayette primed himself for the transition by taking a climate boot camp course, Terra.do, and listened to \"My Climate Journey,\" a popular podcast. Now, Lafayette is the head of business strategy at Overstory. While the work is different, Lafayette found his previous employment experience set him up to be successful at Overstory. \"It's still the same thing. It's just business, it's just with a different focus,\" Lafayette said. \"All the same skills are needed.\" Having the opportunity to develop this kind of skill set in the first place is a privilege, according to Sunrun's Anuras. \"I was thinking about my family, being from Thailand and Southeast Asia. We know Southeast Asia is going to get hit really hard with climate change. And so I'm really thinking a lot about folks who don't have the privilege that I have, where I can say, 'Oh, I'm going to be in Seattle, where it is so cool and climate change is not impacting us in such a severe way,'\" Anuras told CNBC. \"As a privileged technologist, where should I be spending my life?\" Anuras said. As she realized that Anuras realized she can use her skills to combat climate change, the answers to her own questions became increasingly clear. \"What problems do I want to look back and say I helped solve: One of the greatest problems humanity has faced, or I worked on selling some widgets in the metaverse? It just didn't compute for me.\"", "label": "human"}

Speaking less politely, I would say that bull markets breed bloviated bull.\"\n\n3. \"Teaching, like writing, has helped me develop and clarify my own thoughts.

I'm in overtime but I'm out there.\"\n\n6. \"Elon is taking on General Motors and Ford and Toyota, and all these people who've got all this stuff, and he's got an idea and he's winning. That's America. You can't dream it up. It's astounding.\"\n\n7. \"It couldn't happen but it did. If they'd stopped in Omaha on the drive from New York to Seattle and he'd said, 'What do you think of this idea?' I would have said, 'Good luck, Jeff.'\" (Buffett was referring to Amazon's unlikely evolution from an online bookseller to a technology titan under founder Jeff Bezos.)\n\n8. \"Sometimes the stock market is quite investment-oriented, and other times it's almost totally a casino, a gambling parlor \u2014 and that existed to an extraordinary degree in the last couple of years, encouraged by Wall Street.\"\n\n9. \"If you told me you owned all of the bitcoin in the world, and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn't take it because what would I do with it? I would have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn't going to do anything.\"\n\n10. \"The best protection against inflation is still your own personal earnings power.

{"text": "In today's digital world, protecting your online identity is critical. With the rise of cybercrime and hacking, it has never been more important to take the necessary steps to keep your personal information secure. One of the best ways to do this is to use a password manager. Password Manager is a software application that helps people keep their online accounts secure. The program allows users to store all passwords in one place, and then access them with a secure master password.The idea behind the password manager is that you can use a single strong password to protect all your accounts without having to remember multiple weak passwords. As people become more aware of the importance of protecting their online identity, using a password manager has become increasingly popular. The first password manager was released in 1998, but it has become more common in recent years due to the increase in cybercrime and the need for better security. There are many benefits of using a password manager to protect your online identity. First, it eliminates the need to remember multiple passwords. You don't have to remember several weak passwords for different sites, you just need to remember one strong password. This makes it easier for you to keep your account secure. Second, using a password manager ensures that your password is stored in an encrypted format. This means that even if hackers can get your password, they will not be able to access them because they are encrypted. This makes it difficult for hackers to access your personal data. Finally, many password managers offer additional features such as dual-factor authentication and security sharing. Dual-factor authentication is a security measure that requires two forms of identification, such as the code sent to your phone in order to gain access. Secure sharing allows users to share their passwords securely with others (such as family members) without the risk of them being stolen. Of course, there are some risks with using a password manager. For example, if you forget your main password, you will not be able to access your account. That is why it is important to choose a strong password that can be remembered and saved in a safe place. It's also important to choose a reputable password manager. There are many password managers on the market, so it's important to do research and choose a well-reputed password manager. You should also make sure that your password manager is updated regularly, as this will ensure that any security updates are applied. In general, using a password manager can protect your online identity very well. It eliminates the need to remember multiple weak passwords and ensures that your password is stored in an encrypted format. However, it is important to choose a reputable password manager and update it regularly. With these precautions, you can ensure that your online account is secure.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "For nearly 70 years, the Soviet Union has stood firm in Eastern Europe and acted as a counterweight to the United States in global politics. It is a superpower whose influence extends across the globe, with its collapse in 1991 shaking up the international system. Now, three U.S. historians believe that one of the main factors in the decline of the Soviet Union was the presence of an overwhelming majority of older people in its government and economic structure. The three authors, Zachary Karabell, Stephen Kotkin and Jonathan Becker, wrote for the Institute of International Affairs at Harvard's Kennedy School. They argued that the Soviet Union's aristocratic leadership system - in which power was concentrated on older people - was the main obstacle to its economy and progress. The authors cite the traditional concept of son preference to illustrate their views. This is defined as \"a form of government in which rulers are mostly older people whose decisions are influenced by the concerns, ideology and prejudices of their age group\". The Soviet Union had an aristocratic system of government, with leaders mostly in their 70s, 80s and 90s. And these ageing politicians were strongly opposed to free market reforms and open economic policies. For example, despite the fact that the Soviet economy proved to be inefficient and ineffective, central planning continued. Leaders also refused to implement market reforms that would increase productivity. The three authors also argued that the Soviet system was \"extraordinarily obsessed with the past\" and that the leaders of Constantinople did not have the energy or vision to carry out bold reforms. They pointed out that the Soviet Union was in a population boom during the 1960s and 1970s, but the reluctance of nobles to invest in new technologies and lack of vision meant that the country missed opportunities to benefit from its population growth. The authors conclude that the decline of the Soviet Union should be a warning to other countries, such as the United States. They argue that the presence of America's \"old leadership\" can prevent progress and hinder the country's ability to take advantage of future opportunities. The article sparked controversy among historians and political analysts. Some argue that the collapse of the Soviet Union was caused by many different factors, including repression of freedom of expression and costly military adventures. However, others see aristocracy as a major factor. The authors of the paper hope their work will encourage governments around the world to ensure that their economic policies are responsive to future challenges.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Internet providers have warned that the EU's plan to get big tech companies to pay for providing basic internet services could push up prices and create market distortions. The plans are part of the EU's so-called digital services bill, which is still under discussion and will require large tech companies such as Google and Facebook to pay a portion of the cost of providing basic Internet services, such as visiting websites or streaming services. The idea is that because big tech companies make huge profits from using the public internet, they should also contribute to the infrastructure costs of achieving this goal. However, Internet providers warn that such a plan could impose an unnecessary burden on them and may force them to pass the costs on to their customers. \"Any proposal to impose costs on Internet service providers will have a direct and significant impact on the cost of our services and the competitiveness of Europe's digital economy,\" said GSMA Director General Malcolm Johnson, who represents global mobile operators. \"We are concerned about the risk that the digital services bill could lead to higher consumer prices and market distortions,\" he added. The European Commission has issued a long-awaited new digital services bill that will make companies like Google and Facebook take greater responsibility for the services they provide online. The European Commission recommends that companies pay part of the costs associated with providing basic Internet services, such as access to websites or streaming services. The European Commission has not specified the exact percentage of fees these companies will pay, but it is believed that this figure may be around 5-10%. Internet providers argue that such a plan would have a disproportionate impact on them, as it would require them to pay for services provided free of charge to large tech companies. \"It's also important that there is no duplication of costs or inappropriate cross-subsidies from one sector of the industry to another,\" Johnson said. Internet providers also argue that such a plan would distort the market and could result in big tech companies gaining an unfair competitive advantage over their smaller competitors. \"The cost of providing basic Internet services to everyone should be the same, and the competitive landscape should remain fair and balanced,\" Johnson said. These plans have also been criticized by consumer groups, who argue that this could lead to higher Internet fees for consumers. \"Any proposal to shift costs away from big technology to consumers or small businesses is unacceptable,\" said Soren Scholz, director of EU affairs at the consumer rights group BEUC. The bill on digital services is still under discussion, and no final decision has been made. However, the Commission may take Internet providers' warnings seriously because they could have a significant impact on market developments.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "According to Raymond James, the clean energy stock will have a massive rally in 2021. In a study for investors, investment banks said the industry has rebounded over the past three months and is expected to build on this momentum in the coming year. In the report, Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov wrote that the main drivers of the industry surge include \"significant commitments by governments and businesses to renewable energy targets, further reductions in storage and electric vehicle costs, policy regimes increasingly supported by major economies around the world, and continued investor interest in clean energy stocks.\" Morchanov added: \"We remain positive in the field of renewable energy, but with particular emphasis on solar power, storage and electric vehicles. He went on to say that while risks remain in the industry, including the possibility of the Biden administration cutting tax credits from the Trump administration, \"the broader trend towards clean energy has been clearly established and will remain unchanged regardless of policy.\" Mr. Murchanov pointed out that despite the strong performance of the renewable energy sector in 2020, there is still potential for further growth in 2021. In the short term, he said, the best opportunities lie in solar power, storage and electric vehicles. According to Raymond James, solar shares achieved their strongest growth in 2020, with the industry growing by 28.7% this year. Molchanov said that the solar sector can continue to benefit from renewable energy growth and increased investment in major energy utilities. According to Raymond James, there has also been strong growth in energy storage inventories, with the sector growing by 18.7% in 2020. Molchanov noted that demand for energy storage solutions is increasing among energy companies and that government initiatives and subsidies should continue to drive the industry's growth. At the same time, according to Raymond James, electric vehicle inventories performed worst in 2020, but are expected to rise in 2021. Molchanov said that the industry has the potential to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Biden's infrastructure and climate plan. He added that electric vehicle inventories \"have lagged behind their peers this year, but should see a significant rise over the next 12 months due to increased demand from U.S. and global automakers as well as ongoing government policy support.\" Overall, Molchanov said, \"Clean energy stocks should remain one of the biggest winners in 2021, although all other uncertainties are likely to be part of a broader market environment.\" He added that as the industry continues to grow over the coming year, investors should look for stocks with'structural tailwinds'.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "With the onset of winter chills, it's time to break hot chocolate, turn on the heat, and settle down for some comfortable gaming sessions. While temperatures outside may drop, you can always rely on video games to take you to distant fantasy worlds or realist environments. Many of these games have stunning visual effects, with snow being one of the most impressive sights you experience in a virtual world. From the mild, calm snow in Star Valley to the icy explosion of The Last Of Us Part II, video games can take on a wide variety of forms. So here's our overview of some of the game's most amazing uses. 1. Star Valley This peaceful agricultural simulator is one of the most fascinating works on the market. The snow in Stardew Valley stands in stark contrast to the deep greenness of the sliding hills and the comfortable architecture of Pelican Town. A calm sound of snow beneath your feet can perfectly accompany a comfortable winter night. 2. Overflow effects Outlast is a game full of fear, and the snow in this horror classic helps to reinforce that sense of fear and isolation. The winter landscape adds a cold atmosphere to the game as the characters drift high on their chests. Meanwhile, unknown threats lurking in the shadows are ready to erupt when you least expect it. Old Scroll 5: Skyline The snow in the sky is not only gorgeous, it covers mountains and rivers, and creates a landscape of idyllic scenery that changes with seasons. Whether you're exploring the attractive summit of the Rift Valley or reaching the valley's lush valley, the snow makes it even more spectacular. 4. Red Dead Salvation 2 Red Dead Redemption 2 features a stunning weather effect featuring the wilderness, no-law land of the original game. The snow in this game is amazing, piled up high in remote mountains covering the windy plains of New Hanover. You can almost feel the cold of winter winds. The Last of Us, Part 2 Snow in the second part of The Last Of Us is not only a spectacular effect, it's also an integral part of the game story. As you walk through the cold wilderness, snow always reminds you how bad things are. It's a harsh reminder of the dark theme of the game. 6. Zero Dawn Horizon The Horizon Zero Dawn is located in the post-apocalyptic future, with a world of snow-covered forests, icebergs and desert villages. Snow accumulation contributes to creating a sense of despair and desolation that is a harsh reminder of the dangers hidden in the world. 7.The Dying Light In the light of death, a unique open world is set in a city ravaged by zombies.In the chaos and horror of the dead, you will find snow-covered hills and frozen rivers providing a brief moment of peace. 8. Metal Gear Solid V: Ghost Pain The solid series of metal gears is no stranger to snow, and Ghost Pain is no exception. Snowstorms have turned Afghanistan's sandy desert into a welcoming landscape, while snow helps create a sense of tension and fear. This is an appropriate setting for the current dangerous mission. 9. The Shadow of Colossus The dazzling landscape of Corusus' shadow makes it one of the most beloved classics. When you climb the steep peaks of the Forbidden City and deep canyons, there is often snow that brings a sense of calm. Wizard 3: The Wild Hunter The snow-covered landscape of Witcher 3: Wild Hunt clearly illustrates why the game is considered one of the best RPGs ever. In this game, snow is used to produce huge effects, creating a stunning beauty and bitter feeling of loneliness. Whether you're hunting monsters in the North or dressing up in the frozen Scythian Islands, it's always there. Snow is a powerful tool for video game developers, because it can be used to convey all kinds of emotions. Whether they are used to create a peaceful atmosphere or increase tension, snow helps to create an immersive experience for players. These are just some of the most amazing uses in video games, but there are countless other uses as well. Therefore, if you're looking for some winter gaming inspiration, these titles should point you in the right direction.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "By the time those holiday tournaments across the state tip off, there has been ample time to smooth out the wrinkles and work out the kinks. Crowds fill the gyms, the stakes are raised, pressure moments crop up and the brand of basketball at Christmas time evolves into something different than in the weeks leading up to it.\n\nHere\u2019s a look back at the 91st Pontiac Holiday Tournament.\n\nBiggest story: Robert Smith says goodbye with a title\n\nThe relationship between Simeon and Pontiac has been well documented. So it was only fitting that coach Robert Smith, the key figure in keeping Simeon at Pontiac all these years, even through the Derrick Rose and Jabari Parker days, was given a warm and thankful sendoff from the Pontiac faithful.\n\nMore importantly for Smith, his Wolverines continue to impress and look like the No. 1 team in the state. Jalen Griffith remains a calming influence with the ball in his hands, while Miles and Wesley Rubin continue provide a presence at both ends of the floor, and Sam Lewis, the Oak Park transfer, is settling in nicely and becoming more and more impactful.\n\nSimeon took care of business and won yet another Pontiac title in Smith\u2019s final year on the bench.\n\nBiggest surprise: Pontiac advances to quarterfinals\n\nThis won\u2019t resonate much with the majority of Chicago area high school basketball fans, especially ones not connected to the Pontiac Holiday Tournament whatsoever. But Pontiac winning a game in its own tournament, particularly in a winner\u2019s bracket game, is a big deal. Plain and simple: it\u2019s extremely rare.\n\nPontiac knocked off West Aurora 60-55 on the opening night before getting throttled by both Simeon and New Trier. But that first-round win was a feel-good story for the fans of Pontiac and something those players will remember forever.\n\nThe win over West Aurora was the first time Pontiac advanced on in the championship bracket since 2006.\n\nSimeon\u2019s Robert Smith acknowledges the crowd after the Wolverines defeated Benet to win the Pontiac Holiday Tournament. Allen Cunningham/For the Sun-Times\n\nPlayer of the tournament: Benet\u2019s Brayden Fagbemi\n\nThere were bigger names and higher profile players in this tournament \u2013\u2013 even on his own Benet team \u2013\u2013 than Fagbemi. But there wasn\u2019t a player who grabbed the attention of fans or who meant more to his team\u2019s success than this steady, ready-for-the-moment point guard.\n\nWhile Fagbemi was featured as one of the City/Suburban Hoops Report\u2019s projected \u201cbreakout players\u201d in the preseason, no one knew the Johns Hopkins recruit. He was a little-used point guard off the bench a year ago. But he blossomed in the offseason and was brilliant in Pontiac.\n\nFagbemi went for 15 points, seven assists and seven rebounds in the opening win over Oak Park. He handled the relentless pressure and traps thrown his way against Bloom and Joliet West, turning the ball over just four times while playing all 32 minutes in each game. Along with teammate Niko Abusara, he spearheaded the comeback against Simeon before the Redwings fell in the title game.\n\nFagbemi was as poised as they come against relentless pressure, a true floor general. He handed out 20 assists while averaging 12 points and a four-to-one assist-to-turnover ratio.\n\nBest prospect: Joliet West\u2019s Jeremiah Fears\n\nFrom an evaluation standpoint, there just wasn\u2019t a better college prospect in the gym at Pontiac than the sophomore from Joliet West. He made sophomore mistakes. He still has to mature physically and learn how to pick his moments.\n\nBut Fears, the younger brother of star Jeremy Fears, Jr., the Michigan State recruit, has an easy, natural smoothness that screams next level. When you add in his shooting capabilities \u2013\u2013 Fears was 9 of 17 from beyond the arc \u2013\u2013 you have a young offensive force who you wonder just how high of a level he will go over the next two seasons.\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\u27a4 When Kaiden Space is healthy \u2013\u2013 the senior guard is currently out with an injury \u2013\u2013 there are four signed Division I prospects in Simeon\u2019s starting five. But the uncommitted starter, point guard Jalen Griffith, is proving to be the key cog in Robert Smith\u2019s No. 1 ranked team. Griffith, who was named the A.C. Williamson Award winner for his play, leadership and sportsmanship, was instrumental in delivering in key moments.\n\nGriffith led Simeon in scoring with 15 points a game while playing with remarkable efficiency. These numbers are eye-opening when you consider Griffith is a 5-9 point guard: 16 of 24 (67%) from inside the arc and 8 of 12 (67%) from beyond.\n\n\u27a4 They didn\u2019t reach the semifinals or finish in the top four. But the team that\u2019s better than I thought it would be after watching them play at Pontiac is Bloom. Coach Dante Maddox has so much rangy size and length to be disruptive with, and that starts with the backcourt of Raeshom Harris and Jordan Brown.\n\nBloom, which won three games and finished fifth at Pontiac, has lost to three teams this season ranked in the top 10 and who are a combined 46-4 on the season. And they lost to those three teams \u2013\u2013 Benet, Hillcrest and Brother Rice \u2013\u2013 by a combined 13 points.\n\n\u27a4 New Trier continues to be a resilient, physical team that\u2019s going to be an awfully tough out come state tournament time. That grit starts with senior Jake Feigen, a known shooter who averaged 22 points in four games at Pontiac.\n\n\u27a4 Will three straight wins and a consolation championship pump some life into an Oak Park team that came into Pontiac reeling?\n\nThe Huskies had lost four straight. But after falling to Benet for its fifth-straight loss in the first round, Oak Park went on to beat Plainfield North, Peoria Manual and West Aurora in succession to leave Pontiac on a positive note.\n\n\u27a4 The Pontiac Tournament, by all accounts, is the measuring stick for holiday tournaments across the state. This year\u2019s tournament didn\u2019t disappoint. But it had less depth than previous years.\n\nParting shot\n\nThe Robert Smith sendoff wasn\u2019t the only one at Pontiac. The tournament also said farewell to longtime tournament manager Jim Drengwitz, who has led this tournament for the past 23 years.\n\nAlthough always behind the scenes, Drengwitz has been an instrumental part of what has continued to make Pontiac a special place to be for three days each December. He\u2019s been such an omnipresent voice for such a long time at Pontiac that he will undoubtedly be missed. He\u2019s built relationships and organized in a way that has kept this the very best holiday tournament in the state.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Roku says it will begin building its own TVs\n\nRoku (ROKU) announced at CES 2023 in Las Vegas on Wednesday that it will begin selling TVs that it\u2019s designed and built on its own. The streaming giant currently offers Roku-branded TVs through third-party partners including TCL, Hisense, and Philips. The change means that Roku will control all aspects of the TV production process itself, rather than relying on those third parties.\n\nThe company will offer 11 models with sizes ranging from 24 inches to 75 inches and prices running from $119 to $999.\n\n\u201cOver the past 20 years, Roku has been instrumental in what is now the mainstream way to enjoy a great television series, a classic movie, or live sports,\u201d Roku\u2019s president of devices Mustafa Ozgen said in a statement.\n\nRoku announced that it's making it's own TVs at CES 2023. (Image: Roku)\n\n\u201cOur goal is to continue to create an even better TV experience for everyone. These Roku-branded TVs will not only complement the current lineup of partner-branded Roku TV models, but also allow us to enable future smart TV innovations. The streaming revolution has only just begun.\u201d\n\nAccording to Roku, the first-party TVs will go on sale in the U.S. this spring and, like third-party models, run on Roku\u2019s proprietary operating system. All sets will come with Roku voice remotes, Find My Remote, and Private Listening modes.\n\nIn addition to building its own TVs, Roku also announced its new OLED TV reference design for third-party Roku TV partners. The reference design is meant to bring OLED image quality, which provides more vibrant colors and deeper blacks, to a broader audience.\n\nRoku\u2019s deeper moves into the hardware space come as the company grapples with poor ad sales amid a downturn in the broader digital advertising market. While Roku sells hardware like its streaming devices and TVs, the vast majority of its revenue comes from its Platform business, which is made up of ad sales.\n\nIn Q3 2022, Roku\u2019s Platform business made up $670 million of its $761 million in total revenue. Its hardware sales brought in just $91 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut that reliance on advertising has hurt Roku in recent quarters. In Q2, the company missed Wall Street estimates on revenue and earnings per share, blaming the supply chain crunch and fears of falling advertising spending.\n\nAnd while the company met analysts\u2019 expectations in Q3, its Q4 guidance was well below expectations, a troubling sign considering Q4 should be its strongest quarter.\n\nThose problems have weighed on Roku\u2019s stock price throughout the last year, sending shares of the streaming giant plummeting more than 80% over the past 12 months.\n\nThe company will now have to ensure that its latest hardware investments pay off in either improved hardware revenue or better advertising sales by putting more sets in front of more consumers\u2019 eyes. Wall Street will just need to wait and see.\n\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Tech newsletter\n\nMore from Dan\n\nGot a tip? Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

{"text": ".. It's been almost two years since I broke up with my husband. We tried counseling, but the marriage was too broken to be repaired. As time passed, it became clear that the best thing we could do was keep going. Divorce is a difficult experience, but I am determined to stay positive and make the most of it. I decided to focus on healing my heart and mind and learn to find happiness and peace in my newly discovered freedom. One of the ways I found happiness after my divorce was a new understanding of nature and animals.I had the privilege of having a garden in my backyard, and began spending time there to learn about the wildlife and plants around me. It was during this time that I noticed the squirrels for the first time. I began to recognize them visually, learning their behavior and routines. One morning I woke up to find two squirrels fighting for one nuts. It looked like a heated argument - one of them pushing and pushing the other, their voice being raised. But then something extraordinary happened. One squirrel did not enter a full battle, but simply stepped back and handed the nuts to another. It was almost like a gesture of peace and understanding. This moment touched me in a way that I hadn't anticipated. To me, it seemed like a microcosm of the journey I went through - learning to offer understanding and compassion even when there was disagreement. As time passed, my appreciation of the squirrels in the backyard only increased. I found myself watching them carefully through the trees, chasing each other and playing together. I began to recognize some of these tendencies, and I was surprised that their behavior was similar to what I often encountered during my divorce. I would get angry at mistakes or missteps, as they sometimes do. But then I quickly turned to the other path and made corrections, just like they did. I also noticed that their relationship seemed to be consistent with each other, and even when there was disagreement, they seemed able to move quickly without any resentment. My squirrel in the backyard has become a metaphor as I continue to move forward in my post-divorce life. I'm learning compassion and understanding, even if things don't work out the way I want them to. I'm learning to make corrections when necessary and come out of differences. Most importantly, I'm learning to let go of the past and create a new life for myself - full of joy, love and acceptance. Divorce can be a difficult journey, but I am grateful that my backyard squirrels taught me the lesson. They remind me that life can still be beautiful, no matter how dark it may seem, and happiness is always possible.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".. Cardi B hasn't been shy about going deep into politics in recent years, and now the Grammy-winning singer is offering some unusual financial advice. Later on Monday, the rapper said on Instagram Live that she had found a unique way to help deal with inflation. \"That's what I did: I put my money in different banks,\" Cardi B said on the streaming, according to Bloomberg News. She said: \"I'm not a financial advisor, and I'm sure I would be disgusted with it, but you all need to put your money into different banks so that if one bank fails, you don't lose all your money.\" Cardi B's comments come at a time when the global economic crisis continues to rage. Inflation in the United States has been rising, with the consumer price index (CPI) increasing by 2.6% during the 12 months ending November 2020 - its highest level since 2012. Although Cardi B is not a financial advisor, her comments have been taken seriously by many. \"I think the way Cardi B provides financial advice is a bit interesting, but it's also true,\" one Twitter user wrote. \"It's a bit surprising to see her talking about this, but it's a solid strategy,\" another commented. Recently, actor Ashton Kutcher and NBA star Steph Curry shared some tips on how to save money on Instagram Live. But Cardi B's message is particularly pertinent, as many people are feeling the blow of inflation. In response to the rising cost of living, President Joe Biden has proposed a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus package that would cut taxes for people earning as much as $400,000 and provide more assistance to families. If the plan is approved, it is expected to inject more money into the economy, thereby reducing the impact of inflation. But at the same time, Cardi B's information on bank account diversification may prove to be good advice. As the economic crisis continues, other celebrities will likely continue to offer their own financial advice in the coming months. While Cardi B's comments may seem common sense, she has a big advantage over traditional financial advisors - her large and active social media followers. So, while this may be a bit unusual, Cardi B's advice is probably exactly what people need to keep their money safe.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Rest is often cast as the antithesis of success. In a culture that often glorifies \"the grind,\" clocking insanely long hours, eating lunch at our desks and having no time to do anything outside of our jobs have become badges of honor. The message that success belongs to go-getters who work themselves into exhaustion in pursuit of their dreams is preached everywhere from viral Instagram posts claiming \"sleep is for the weak\" to business executives who brag about working 100-hour weeks. But it turns out that slowing down, doing less and setting aside time to rest can actually help you be more successful \u2014 and productive \u2014 at work in the long run.\n\nThe hidden benefits of resting at work\n\nSpending more time resting during the workday doesn't just stave off burnout \u2014 past research shows it can stimulate creativity, help you concentrate better and make the time you spend on meetings and tasks more efficient. \"Rest is an essential component of working well and working smart,\" Alex Soojung-Kim Pang, author of the book \"Rest: Why You Get More Done When You Work Less,\" once explained in an op-ed for Greater Good Magazine. What's more, \"rest is productive,\" LaShawn Davis, a human resources consultant, tells CNBC Make It. \"Productivity isn't just about getting results, it's about getting the best results you can, and it's impossible to perform your best if you're not well-rested.\" People who prioritize rest, Davis adds, show up to work more energized, focused and prepared to tackle any challenges that arise. That's because even when our brain is resting, it's still active, engaging its \"default network\" to problem-solve, think creatively and seek out new information, Pang explained. \"We may not be able to control these processes completely,\" he added. \"But by learning to rest better, we can support them [and] let them work.\"\n\nHow to incorporate rest into your schedule", "label": "human"}
{"text": "From the outside looking in, it seems VinFast succeeded in hitting its target delivery date at the price of failing the customer. The young EV automaker said repeatedly this year that it planned to deliver the first examples of the VF 8 battery-electric SUV to reservation holders before 2022 ended. The Silver Queen cargo ship left Vietnam in late November, disgorging 999 VF 8's at the port of Benicia, north of San Francisco, in December. Then came the ol' switcheroo. Every unit on the cargo ship was a previously unheard of \"limited release\" variant called the City Edition set aside \"for VinFirst Pioneer customers only,\" the first among the reservation holders. In a letter to expectant shoppers, VinFast said the City Edition's \"early release [was] to meet the demand of VinFast vehicle lovers\" and offers a range of \"approximately\" 180 miles instead of the 260-mile range promised in April this year.\n\nThe City Edition's smaller range comes courtesy of a smaller 82-kWh battery instead of the 87.7-kWh battery in the series production VF 8. The bad news continues with VinFast's retail site claiming 179 EPA-estimated miles, not 180. The company says an OTA update in January will improve range, but didn't say by how much.\n\nThe automaker's also delayed its battery subscription program that was going to cost $169 per month for the VF 8 and give customers unlimited miles. The relevant page on the retail site now says, \"At this time all vehicles are sold or leased inclusive of battery,\" and the vehicle warranty lasts for 10 years or 125,000 miles. With the subscription once touted as a way to save money on leasing or ownership, its end could help explain why prices have gone up on the series production models. In April, VinFast expected to sell a VF 8 Eco with a 260-mile range for $41,200 after the $1,200 destination fee, a VF 8 Plus with a 277-mile range costing $49,200. Now, the City Edition Eco starts at $56,700, the City Edition Plus starts at $63,700, the base VF 8 Eco starts at $60,200.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor comparison, a 2023 Ford Mustang Mach-E Premium with e-AWD and the standard battery with 224 miles of range starts at $58,975, if you could find one.\n\nVinFast offered the VinFirst Pioneers a $6,000 total discount for switching to the City Edition, but it's possible the number of aggrieved reservation holders compelled a change of strategy. Instead of the letter's assertion that the model was only for early adopters, VinFast's retail website now shows a pop up offering a 24-month lease deal to California residents who want the City Edition. With $5,774 due at signing, the City Edition Eco will cost $599 per month and offer 10,000 miles per year. A 36-month lease offer asks $6,869 down and $574 per month. The City Edition Plus needs $6,789 due at signing, then costs $699 per month for 10,000 miles per year for 24 months.\n\nBack to ranges, there could be more questions on the way for the series models. On VinFast's U.S. site, the reservation page containing specs for the VF 8 and VF 9 also include asterisks next to their range figures of \"up to 292 miles\" and \"up to 342 miles,\" respectively. On that page, the explanation given for both is, \"Value valid for VF 8 Eco Enhanced Range trim level (battery variant 2). Preliminary values, determined according to the principles of the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP) Standard.\" All of which means the various numbers VinFast is using here might not end up being the numbers the EPA uses.\n\nIt's early days for the company here, and news cycles turn quickly. Nevertheless, we think VinFast's local reps are going to be busy for a while getting everything headed in the desired direction again.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The appetite for Treasury inflation-protected securities ETFs, otherwise known as TIPS, may soon increase.\n\nAccording to Charles Schwab's D.J. Tierney, these investments are becoming more appealing as the economy shows further signs of a slowdown.\n\n\"With the rate move upward and inflation breakevens, [TIPS ETFs] might make more sense right now than they did a year or two ago,\" the firm's senior investment portfolio strategist told CNBC's \"ETF Edge\" last week. \"We still believe in it for the long haul.\"\n\nTIPS ETFs are indexed to inflation, so their principal value is adjusted up when inflation rises. Despite major inflows in 2020, TIPS ETFs have been seeing meaningful outflows this year.\n\n\"What you're seeing in 2022, it's just a little bit of the pendulum swinging the other way,\" Tierney said. \"Is inflation as big a concern right now moving forward as it was a year ago? Probably not. Investors might have made tactical allocations towards TIPS ETFs and maybe they're pulling that back a little bit.\"\n\nTierney is the client liaison for Schwab U.S. TIPS ETF , which is down 16% so far this year.

The DOJ claimed that a merger of the industry-dominating publishers could \"lessen competition\" in the market.\n\nSoon after the judge's decision, Paramount Global , which owns Simon & Schuster, officially pulled the plug on the deal. Paramount noted that it would explore options to sell Simon & Schuster elsewhere.\n\nPenguin disagreed with the DOJ's ruling and had planned to appeal until Paramount subsequently backed out of the deal.\n\n\"We regret Markus Dohle's decision to leave Bertelsmann and Penguin Random House,\" said Christoph Mohn, chairman of Penguin parent Bertelsmann's supervisory board. \"He has sustainably focused Penguin Random House on growth and profitability.

It has a $695 annual fee, but you get some great perks in return, including access to fancy Centurion lounges at airports around the world.\n\nWhile most of its benefits are related to travel \u2014 such as complimentary elite status with Hilton and Marriott** and up to $200 in annual airline fee credits** \u2014 the Platinum Card has added new perks like digital subscription credits** and Equinox membership credits** to help offset the annual fee.

But if you want as many premium perks as possible and don't get an invite for the exclusive Amex Black card, this is the next best thing.\n\nThe Platinum Card earns American Express Membership Rewards points that you can transfer to more than a dozen airline and hotel partners.

To get an idea, Insider's rewards experts developed a set of points and miles valuations, which approximates the value of each Amex point at 1.8 cents on average, though it's possible to get a lesser or much greater value depending on how you use them.\n\nThe Platinum Card comes with a welcome offer of 80,000 Membership Rewards\u00ae points after spending $6,000 on purchases in the first six months of card membership. Based on our valuations, 80,000 points are worth about $1,440, which alone makes up for more than two years of the annual fee.\n\nIf you transfer points to airline frequent-flyer programs and use them to fly round-trip to Europe \u2014 or even one-way in first class \u2014 you could end up getting a much higher value.\n\nIf you're staying close to home, you can still use Amex Membership Rewards points for lots of non-travel redemptions, including:\n\nBenefits and features\n\nEven among premium cards, the Platinum Card stands out for offering the longest list of benefits you'll find. This includes both a healthy selection of travel credits and perks like lounge access, as well as statement credits for Saks purchases and access to the Amex concierge service.\n\nAirport lounge access\n\nThe Platinum Card offers access to various airport lounges, not just the Priority Pass lounges** you can access with the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae, Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card, and the Hilton Honors American Express Aspire Card (though you can access these, too).\n\nThis includes:\n\nAmex's proprietary Centurion lounges, located at more than 10 airports in the US and with one location in Hong Kong. These lounges offer comfortable seating, complimentary cocktails, and food created by award-winning chefs. Access to these lounges is limited to holders of Platinum Card or Amex Centurion cards.\n\nIf you're flying with Delta and carry a Platinum Card, you can also access any Delta Sky Club lounge. With more than 30 locations, Sky Clubs offer snacks, complimentary soft and alcoholic drinks (with more \"premium\" drinks available for purchase), fast WiFi, and a place to unwind. Some also feature showers.\n\nInternational American Express lounges (with locations in countries like Argentina, Australia, and Mexico)\n\nEscape Lounges, with locations in the US and UK\n\nFinally, the Platinum Card comes with a membership to Priority Pass, a network of more than 1,300 airport lounges around the world. With that membership, you and two guests can access any lounge location (as long as there's room) to enjoy free snacks, drinks, newspapers and magazines, showers, and more.\n\nUp to $200 annual airline fee credit\n\nEvery calendar year, the Platinum Card offers up to a $200 credit toward incidental fees** on one airline of your choice.\n\nIt doesn't cover tickets but applies to a wide variety of things such as checked bags, flight-change fees, inflight food and drinks, fees for traveling with a pet, airport-lounge day passes (if you don't already have complimentary access), and sometimes even things like seat assignments and extra-legroom upgrade fees at one airline.\n\nUp to $200 in Uber Cash each year\n\nThe Platinum Card offers up to $200 in Uber Cash credits** each year. The credit is broken into chunks \u2014 each month, you'll get a $15 credit added to your linked Uber account, with an extra $20 for a total of $35 each December.\n\nIf you travel regularly or live close to a city, this is an easy perk to get value from. You can also put the credits toward UberEats orders for food or even groceries and household supplies.\n\nIn addition, your account will be upgraded to Uber VIP status. There aren't a ton of perks with this, and it's available only in some cities, but you'll only be connected to drivers with at least a 4.8-star rating.\n\nUp to $100 in Saks credit each year\n\nThe Platinum Card offers up to $50 in statement credits when you use the card to make a Saks purchase from January to June, and up to $50 again from July through December each year**.\n\nElite status with Hilton Honors and Marriott Bonvoy\n\nThe Platinum Card comes with Gold-level elite status at both Marriott and Hilton loyalty programs**.\n\nIf you stay at hotels even a few nights a year, these benefits can be extremely valuable \u2014 Hilton offers Gold elites free breakfast for two each morning (currently awarded as a food and beverage credit in the US).\n\nUp to $100 to cover the application fee for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck\n\nTSA PreCheck and Global Entry are absolute musts for just about any traveler. Once you enroll, you can use special lanes to breeze through airport security \u2014 you won't have to remove shoes and light coats, and you can leave your laptop in your bag. With Global Entry, you can use a fast lane when you return to the US from abroad, which makes clearing immigration and customs easy and quick.\n\nThe programs cost $78 to $100, and American Express will provide a credit for that fee every four years (memberships are valid for five years).\n\nUp to $200 hotel credit\n\nCardholders will get up to $200 in credit each calendar year toward prepaid bookings at Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts or Hotel Collection properties (with a minimum of two-night stay) when they book with their card through Amex Travel. This credit expires at the end of every year and doesn't roll over, but you're only required to book by December 31 to receive the credit\u2014 your travel dates can be later.\n\nFine Hotels and Resorts bookings include perks such as free breakfast, guaranteed late checkout, room upgrades and early check-in when available, and a welcome amenity or credit unique to each property. If you would have otherwise paid cash for a luxury hotel stay, this perk can effectively shave $200 off your annual fee cost.\n\nBookings with The Hotel Collection must be for a minimum of two nights, and include benefits like room upgrades and a $100 on-property credit.\n\n$189 CLEAR\u00ae credit\n\nCLEAR\u00ae is an expedited security screening program that can save you time waiting in long lines at select US airports and stadiums. A CLEAR\u00ae membership normally costs $189 per year ($119 for members of the United or Delta frequent flyer programs, and further discounts are available for elite status members), but if you pay with your Platinum Card, you'll receive a credit to offset the CLEAR\u00ae application fee**.\n\nWhen you have a CLEAR\u00ae membership, you can jump to the front of the security line, but \u2014 unlike TSA PreCheck members \u2014you'll still have to remove items like your laptop and shoes before getting screened. CLEAR\u00ae isn't a government program so the application requirements are much less stringent than those of TSA PreCheck and Global Entry.\n\nThe downside is that CLEAR\u00ae screening is only in select locations, so if the airports you travel through don't participate, this benefit is of little use to you. However, the program is also available at a handful of stadiums, so if you're a sports fan who likes to attend live games, this could end up being a good deal.\n\nUp to $240 digital entertainment credit\n\nAccording to Amex, 78% of Platinum Card cardholders took advantage of limited-time statement credits for streaming services that were offered during the height of the pandemic in 2020. These new digital entertainment credits are permanent, and are awarded in chunks of up to $20 per month (maximum $240 per year). Enrollment is required before you can use this perk.\n\nEligible digital subscription services for the credit include:\n\nAudible \u2014 Plans start at $7.95 per month (after free trial)\n\nThe New York Times \u2014 $17 every four weeks for a standard subscription (after any introductory offers)\n\nSiriusXM \u2014 Plans start at $10.99 per month (after any introductory offers)\n\nPeacock \u2014 Plans start at $4.99 per month\n\nDisney+ \u2014 Plans start at $7.99 per month\n\nThe Disney Bundle \u2014 Plans start at $13.99 per month\n\nESPN+ \u2014 Plans start at $6.99 per month\n\nHulu \u2014 Plans start at $6.99 per month\n\nDepending on if these are subscriptions you already have (or would be likely to use), this credit might not make a difference for you.\n\nUp to $300 Equinox credit\n\nCardholders can receive up to $300 annually (up to $25 per month) in credits toward Equinox gym memberships or digital subscriptions to on-demand fitness classes through the Equinox+ app**. Enrollment is also required to activate this benefit.\n\nEquinox is a chain of high-end fitness clubs that are mostly located in large US cities. The company's website lists 106 locations, 40 of which are in Manhattan, and the rest are sprinkled around places like Chicago, Miami, London, and Washington, DC.\n\nAmex recently made the Equinox credit more useful by making it usable toward any membership (previously was restricted to Equinox All Access, Destination, E by Equinox, or Equinox+). In addition, starting in 2023, you can use all $300 of the credit at once \u2014 it will no longer be doled out in $25-per-month increments.\n\nAgain, if this is something you'd pay for anyway, these credits could amount to a nice little discount \u2014 but keep in mind that Equinox memberships are not cheap. For example, with a 12-month commitment, you'd pay $240 per month for membership at the Rockefeller Center location, and $275 per month if you want access to all US clubs.\n\nWalmart+ membership credit\n\nWhen you use your Platinum Card to pay for Walmart's subscription service, Walmart+, you'll receive a statement credit for the cost** ($12.95 plus applicable sales tax each month).\n\nOnly Walmart+ monthly memberships (not annual) qualify for this perk. A Walmart+ membership gets you free delivery, free shipping with no minimums, pharmacy discounts, and other perks \u2014 so if you're already a Walmart shopper it's a no-brainer to use this benefit.\n\n$300 SoulCycle at-home bike credit\n\nIf you're in the market for a SoulCycle at-home bike, use your Platinum Card to make the purchase through your Equinox+ account online and you'll receive a $300 statement credit. These bikes cost about $2,500, so this isn't a massive discount \u2014 but if you're making this purchase anyway, it's a nice deal.\n\nYou can actually redeem this credit for up to 15 separate bike purchases each year, but keep in mind each purchase requires a 12-month Equinox+ membership ($40 per month plus applicable tax) to qualify, and purchases made in-store or through the Equinox mobile app aren't eligible for the credit.\n\nAmex Fine Hotels & Resorts\n\nAmex Platinum cardmembers can access the Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts program. When you book participating hotels through Amex Travel, you'll enjoy perks including room upgrades, free breakfast, late checkout, free Wi-Fi, and a unique amenity at each hotel, like a credit to use at on-property spas or restaurants.\n\nAmex Platinum concierge\n\nPlatinum Card holders also get exclusive concierge service. The concierge service can be helpful for things like getting tickets to shows or helping you plan a trip itinerary. While the services are complimentary, you're responsible for paying for any services booked or purchases made on your behalf\n\nCell phone protection\n\nAmex has added cell phone protection to a number of premium cards, including the Platinum Card.\n\nWhen you use the card to pay your wireless bill, you're covered for the cost of repair or replacement if your phone is damaged or stolen, up to $800 per claim and up to two claims per 12-month period. There's a $50 deductible, and you must file your claim within 90 days of the incident.\n\nCar rental insurance\n\nThe Platinum Card offers secondary car rental insurance when you use the card to pay for your rental in full and decline the rental company's collision damage waiver. Coverage is for theft or damage only (not liability) and some rentals, vehicle types, and countries are excluded, so be sure to read the terms.\n\nTrip cancellation and interruption insurance\n\nSome Amex cards now include trip cancellation and interruption benefits. If you paid for a covered trip with the Platinum Card and it's canceled or cut short for a covered reason, you could be reimbursed up to $10,000 per trip and up to $20,000 per card per consecutive 12-month period.\n\nBaggage insurance\n\nWhen you pay for a covered trip with your Platinum Card, you can be covered for baggage loss or damage, up to $2,000 per person for checked bags and $3,000 per person for carry-on luggage.\n\nThere are exclusions for high-risk items and some states have different limits, so check the terms and conditions for specific details.\n\nTrip delay insurance\n\nYou can get reimbursed up to $500 for meals, lodging, toiletries, medication, and other personal items if you've paid for a covered trip with your Platinum Card and it's delayed by six hours or more, up to two times per consecutive 12-month period.\n\nReturn protection\n\nIf you purchased an eligible item with the Platinum Card and the merchant won't accept your return, you're may get a refund of the full purchase price (excluding shipping and handling), up to $300 per item and a maximum of $1,000 per calendar year.\n\nPurchase protection\n\nWhen you pay for an eligible item with the Platinum Card, you can be covered for loss or damage up to 90 days from the date of purchase, up to a maximum of $10,000 per occurrence and $50,000 per year.\n\nExtended warranty\n\nCardholders can also get an extended warranty on eligible items when they use their Platinum Card to pay \u2014 up to one additional year added to eligible US manufacturer's warranties of five years or less.\n\nPremium Global Assist Hotline\n\nThe Platinum Card comes with an underrated perk that can be a lifesaver if you have an emergency while you're away from home. Cardholders get access to Amex's Premium Global Assist Hotline, which can help arrange things like passport replacement, medical referrals, and translation services.\n\nThe service itself is complimentary, but you may be responsible for any third-party costs. One big difference from the regular (versus premium) Global Assist Hotline is emergency medical evacuation coverage \u2014 Amex may provide emergency medical transportation assistance at no cost if it's approved and coordinated by Premium Global Assist Hotline.\n\nAmex Offers\n\nLike other American Express cards, the Platinum Card includes targeted discounts and bonus rewards at participating merchants through Amex Offers**.\n\nThe Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express 4.75 /5 A five pointed star A five pointed star A five pointed star A five pointed star A five pointed star 4.75 out of 5 Stars Intro offer 80,000 Membership Rewards\u00ae points after spending $6,000 on purchases in the first six months of card membership Rewards Earn 5x Membership Rewards\u00ae Points for flights booked directly with airlines or with American Express Travel on up to $500,000 per calendar year.

Read our review Read Our Review A looong arrow, pointing right\n\nFees and costs\n\nAs discussed above, the Platinum Card has a $695 annual fee. This isn't waived for the first year, so you'll start paying it as soon as you're approved for the card. However, if you're an active-duty servicemember, you could be able to get the Amex Platinum without the annual fee.\n\nThe card doesn't charge foreign transaction fees but it does have the Pay Over Time financing option (rather than paying your statement balance in full each month), See Pay Over Time APR to see your rates. Additionally, there's a late payment fee and a returned payment fee of up to $40.\n\nIf you're considering this card, make sure you're able to pay your statement balance in full each month \u2014 both because the interest fees will rack up quickly if you don't, and there are better cards to consider if you need to carry a balance from month to month.\n\nComparison: Amex Platinum vs other American Express cards\n\nThe Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express American Express\u00ae Gold Card American Express\u00ae Green Card Annual fee $695 $250 $150 Rewards rate 5x points on airfare purchased directly through the airline, and on flights and hotels booked through Amex Travel*** 1 point per dollar on everything else 4x points at restaurants, and at U.S. supermarkets* 3x points on flights booked directly through the airline or Amex Travel 1 point per dollar on everything else 3x points on travel, transit, and restaurants 1 point per dollar on all other purchases Welcome bonus offer 80,000 Membership Rewards\u00ae points after spending $6,000 on purchases in the first six months of card membership 60,000 points after you spend at least $4,000 in your first 6 months of card membership 40,000 points after you spend $2,000 on purchases in the first six months of account opening Statement credits Up to $200 in airline fee credits each calendar year Up to $100 in Saks credits each calendar year** Global Entry or TSA PreCheck application fee credit Up to $300 annually (up to $25 per month) on the Equinox+ app or eligible Equinox club memberships** $189 per year in credits for CLEAR\u00ae membership** Up to $200 in credits per year toward prepaid hotel bookings through Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts or The Hotel Collection (with a two-night minimum) Up to $240 in annual credits (up to $20 per month) toward eligible digital subscriptions***** $12.95 in credits each month toward Walmart+ membership** $300 statement credit toward a purchase of SoulCycle At-Home Bike online Up to $120 in dining credits each calendar year** Up to $189 in CLEAR\u00ae credit per year** Up to $100 in LoungeBuddy credit per year** Other benefits Up to $200 in Uber Cash each calendar year** Gold elite status with Hilton and Marriott (enrollment required) Airport lounge access (Priority Pass**, Centurion lounges, and more) Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts (benefits at exclusive luxury properties) The Hotel Collection (property credits and upgrades) Cell phone protection Secondary car rental insurance Trip cancellation insurance Baggage insurance Trip delay insurance Return protection Purchase protection Extended warranty Premium Global Assist Hotline Discounts and bonuses through Amex Offers** No foreign transaction fees Up to $120 in Uber Cash each calendar year**** The Hotel Collection (property credits and upgrades) Secondary car rental insurance Baggage insurance Trip delay insurance Purchase protection Extended warranty Global Assist Hotline Discounts and bonuses through Amex Offers** No foreign transaction fees Secondary car rental insurance Trip delay insurance Baggage insurance Purchase protection Extended warranty Global Assist Hotline Discounts and bonuses through Amex Offers** No foreign transaction fees Review Amex Gold card review Amex Green card review\n\n*on up to $25,000 spent at U.S. supermarkets per calendar year, then 1x\n\n**up to $10 in statement credits per month when you use the Amex Gold card at Grubhub, Seamless, The Cheesecake Factory, Milk Bar, Wine.com, Goldbelly, and participating Shake Shack locations.

SiriusXM, and The New York Times\n\nAmex Platinum frequently asked questions (FAQ)\n\nIs the Amex Platinum worth the annual fee? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. If you can use the Platinum Card's generous range of benefits, you can get a value that far exceeds the card's $695 annual fee. Even if you don't maximize every benefit, it's fairly easy to at least offset the annual fee between up to $200 in airline fee credits, up to $200 in Uber Cash, up to $100 in Saks credits, and up to $240 in digital entertainment credits each year.\n\nIs the Amex Platinum hard to get approved for? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Because it's a premium rewards card, the Platinum Card is harder to get approved for than some other popular cards. Amex will look at your credit score, income, and other factors when it considers your application. Keep in mind you won't be eligible for the welcome offer if you already have, or have had, the Platinum Card because of Amex's once-per-lifetime rule. However, if you have/had another version of the Platinum, such as The Business Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express , you're still eligible for the bonus.\n\nCan you carry a balance on the Amex Platinum? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. The Platinum Card requires you to pay your balance off in full each month, unless you're enrolled in Amex's Pay Over Time feature. This extended-financing option allows cardholders to pay off qualifying charges over $100 over a longer time period, with interest.\n\nCan you add authorized users to the Amex Platinum card? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. If you want your authorized users to receive select card benefits, including airport lounge access, a TSA PreCheck or Global Entry credit, and hotel/rental car elite status, you can add up to three Platinum authorized users at a cost of $175 total. Any additional authorized users after that cost $175 each. However, if you don't need these benefits for your additional cardholders, you can add up to 99 Gold authorized users at no cost. Authorized user Gold cards are not the same as the standalone Amex Gold Card; in addition, these cardholders will not receive airport lounge access or elite status, but they are eligible for their own TSA PreCheck or Global Entry application fee credit.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Luggage Handlers - We are an unpopular hero at the airport, we are responsible for transferring your luggage from the check-in counter to the aircraft and returning it again.We are responsible for ensuring that your baggage arrives on time - and together - so you can enjoy your holidays. But what happens when things go wrong and your bag doesn't come out? Well, that doesn't mean we just sit up and lift our feet. We try to get your bag right behind the scenes as quickly as possible. I am an airport baggage handler and I would like to give you an insider's view of what is happening at the airport in order to ensure that your luggage arrives from point A to point B. First of all, when your checked baggage is lost, it's not like an airline just swinging its shoulders and spending a day. We will deal with this case right away.We immediately search through the luggage compartment to see if we can find the missing bag.We will also look at the baggage tracking system to see where the last package you see is.

{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nJust seconds after Buffalo Bills player Damar Hamlin collapsed on the field from cardiac arrest on Monday, medical personnel swarmed onto the field in an immediate response that has been widely credited for the player\u2019s steps toward recovery.\n\nBut one Bills team member in particular \u2013 assistant athletic trainer Denny Kellington \u2013 has been praised by head coach Sean McDermott for \u201csaving Damar\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nBills offensive lineman Dion Dawkins said in a tweet Thursday that it was Kellington who administered critical CPR to Hamlin, who doctors say lost his pulse on the field had to be immediately revived through resuscitation and defibrillation.\n\n\u201cFor an assistant to find himself at that position and needing to take the action that he did and step up and take charge like he did \u2013 and there were others on the field as well \u2013 is nothing short of amazing,\u201d McDermott said of Kellington during a news conference Thursday.\n\n\u201cAnd the courage that took - you talk about a real leader, a real hero in saving Damar\u2019s life and just admire his strength.\u201d\n\nHamlin was transported to the hospital, where he was sedated. On Thursday, his doctors announced Hamlin had started to awaken. Though he remains critically ill and on a ventilator, his medical team said the player is showing signs of \u201cgood neurologic recovery\u201d and is making significant improvement.\n\nThe immediate response of Kellington and other medical personnel was vital to \u201cnot just saving his life, but his neurological function,\u201d Dr. Timothy Pritts, one of Hamlin\u2019s doctors at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, said Thursday.\n\nIn cardiac arrest, the heart is no longer pumping blood, which means no oxygen is traveling to the brain or other organs. Seconds matter: The longer a person goes without oxygen, the chances of organ damage increase, and the chances of survival decrease. CPR mimics a pumping heart, which keeps blood flowing, and a defibrillator shocks the heart, which can cause it to start beating again.\n\nKellington has been a member of the Bills\u2019 training staff since 2017. Prior to joining the team, he was an athletic trainer at Syracuse University for 11 years, six of which were spent as the head athletic trainer for the football team, according to the university and Kellington\u2019s LinkedIn. He also previously served as a graduate student athletic trainer at Ohio State University, the school confirmed to CNN.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback If you don't know how to perform CPR, watch this 03:36 - Source: CNN\n\n\u2018We\u2019re going to need everybody\u2019\n\nIn audio obtained by CNN of medical personnel who responded from the sidelines, medical teams can be heard urgently requesting everyone to respond the minute Hamlin collapsed at 8:55 p.m. ET.\n\nAt 8:55 p.m. ET, when Hamlin hit the ground, someone can be heard saying, \u201cGo over to the cot. I don\u2019t like how he went down.\u201d\n\nA few seconds later, another voice says, \u201cWe\u2019re going to need everybody. All call, all call.\u201d Within the minute, several other cries go out for all personnel to rush to the field.\n\nBetween 9:12 and 9:20 p.m., personnel can be heard requesting another medic and emergency equipment for the ambulance.\n\nThe rapid response of medical teams that night has been repeatedly praised by NFL officials, Bills team members and physicians.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly not an exaggeration to say that the skilled and the immediate response by all of these talented caregivers prevented a very tragic outcome at that moment,\u201d NFL chief medical officer Dr. Allen Sills said Wednesday.\n\nSills said that the league holds drills before the season to prepare for medical emergencies and also holds briefing meetings among medical teams before every game.\n\nMcDermott also opened the Bills\u2019 news conference Thursday with a word of thanks for \u201cthe first responders on the field this past Monday evening and the medical teams of the Bills, the Bengals and the staff, doctors and nurses at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center for their work and their care.\u201d", "label": "human"}
{"text": ".. JANUARY 3, 2023 - Goldman Sachs released its top stocks to implement the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed by Congress late last year. The IRA aims to reduce inflation and interest rates across the board, thereby boosting investor confidence and providing more sources of funding. Goldman Sachs believes that the IRA can raise the stock market valuation by 50% next year, giving investors an excellent opportunity to take advantage of this potential. According to Goldman Sachs, potential beneficiaries of the IRA include several of the world's largest banks, technology companies and energy and utility stocks. The Bank's Shares: Bank of America: Bank of America is the largest bank in the United States, and a major provider of capital, credit, and financial services. Goldman Sachs believes that BofA can benefit greatly from IRA because a strong economy and easier access to finance could mean more sources of lending, increased investment in technology, and higher overall profits. JP Morgan Chase is the second largest bank in the United States, with one of the world's largest financial services portfolios. Goldman Sachs expects JPMorgan to benefit from the IRA on two fronts: greater access to capital and increased demand for its services. Inventory of technology: Apple: Apple is one of the most valuable companies in the world and has been at the forefront of technological innovation for decades. With the intervention of the IRA, Goldman Sachs expects Apple to benefit from growing demand for its products as well as lower raw materials and manufacturing costs. Goldman Sachs believes that Apple's stock value could increase by as much as 50% over the next year. Alphabet: Google's parent company, Alphabet, has also been a major tech power. Goldman Sachs believes that the IRA can benefit Alphabet in two ways: by increasing investment in technology (which could lead to higher revenues) and by increasing market competition (which might increase profits). Energy and Public Utilities Unit: ExxonMobil: ExxonMobil is one of the world's largest producers of oil and gas, with record production. Goldman Sachs believes that the IRA can benefit from ExxonMobil in two ways: by reducing customers' energy costs and increasing demand for their services. DUCK ENERGY: DUCK ENERGY is one of the largest power companies in the United States, serving more than 7 million customers. Goldman Sachs believes that the IRA can benefit Duke in two ways: by increasing investment in energy infrastructure (which could lead to higher revenues) and lowering customer energy costs (which might increase demand). In addition to these stocks, Goldman Sachs has recommended several smaller companies such as Tesla, Salesforce, Adobe and Visa, which could also benefit from the IRA. In summary, the IRA has the potential to significantly increase its overall stock valuation. Investors should view Goldman Sachs listed stocks as a potential investment opportunity to capitalize on the potential rise of the IRA.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "As Veterans Day approaches, President Joe Biden on Monday praised a new law that helps veterans with toxic exposure associated with military burn pits that send smoke and toxins into the air. The president made those remarks in a speech marking the holiday, promoting the John S. McCain Burning Pitt Toxic Exposure Compensation Act, which was signed into law earlier this year and went into effect this month. The bill, named after the late Senator John McCain, provides free medical care to veterans suffering from health conditions in burn pits and other toxic substances, and also makes it easier for veterans to prove their exposure to toxic substances and therefore qualify for medical and other benefits. \"The benefits of this law are real,\" Biden said in his speech, \"and it will provide our veterans and their families with the care and support they have received and deserve.\" The new law could benefit thousands of veterans who believe it is due to health problems caused by their exposure to burning pits while deployed in the Middle East and elsewhere to support wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Many veterans said they were exposed to smoke containing toxic chemicals, carcinogens, asbestos and burning human remains during their service, and reported experiencing a range of symptoms, including respiratory problems, cancer and other debilitating diseases. The military insists that the burning pit did not cause health problems, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said there was \"no consistent pattern of increased health risk\" in contact with the military burn pit. But veterans say the issue has long been overlooked, and that the passage of the McCain Act is an important first step toward recognizing the damage caused by burn holes and getting the help they need. \"This day we celebrate is all about our veterans,\" Biden said, \"which is why our government is doing everything it can to ensure that those who have given so much for their country are taken care of - not just on Veterans Day, but every day.\" The law is named after the late Senator John McCain, who died in 2018 during a long battle with brain cancer. Before his death, McCain worked to get the bill through the Senate, and his daughter Meghan McCain said it was a \"strong tribute\" to her father's legacy. McCain's widow, Cindy, joined Biden at Veterans Day on Monday and said she was \"very proud\" of the legislation now named after her late husband. \"Over the years, we've heard stories of sick veterans and their exposure to toxic pollutants in burning pits,\" she said. \"This new law will provide medical care for veterans and their families who have health problems due to this exposure, so it won't be in vain.\" The Act also authorizes the Veterans Health Administration to establish a burn pit registry to track veterans' exposure to burn holes and other toxic substances, and to collect data on the health status of exposed veterans. Biden noted that the registry will \"help us understand the full range of health effects from burn pits so we can better treat and prevent diseases in exposed people and their families.\" In his speech, Biden praised veterans' service and expressed hope that the future will meet and recognize the needs of veterans. \"We should respect your courage and sacrifice whenever and wherever you serve,\" he said, adding: \"That's why as president I will continue to ensure that our nation's veterans receive the care and benefits they deserve.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The Russian forces most often launch Iranian-made kamikaze drones at night along the Dnipro riverbed, because this way, it is harder to detect the UAVs with radar.\n\nSource: Yurii Ihnat, spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force, on the air of Ukrainian Radio\n\nDetails: When asked why the air defence does not shoot down UAVs moving along the Dnipro River, the Air Force spokesman noted:\n\nQuote: \"Because they become less visible on radar the closer they press to the ground. If you want to live, you have to get lower. The radar antenna that detects the target will not see it if the target is flying below the level of the antenna.\"\n\nDetails: When asked whether citizens can help the military, Ihnat explained that the ePPO [a smartphone application that can be used to notify Ukrainian air defence forces about Russian missiles and drones \u2013 ed.] systems are unlikely to provide any information at the time of the attack.\n\nMost often drones fly at night, and Ukrainians can detect them only by sound. However, it is not that simple. While there is a warning system or calls to the police, time will pass and the drone will already be in another place (its speed is 150 km/h).\n\nThe most important thing for citizens is to take care of themselves and stay in shelters, the colonel explains.\n\nQuote: \"Because even with 100% air defence, unfortunately, fragments fall and can destroy cars, buildings and [take \u2013 ed.] people's lives. When the missile hits the target, it does not explode immediately head-on with a Shahed, but next to it.\n\nThis is how anti-aircraft weapons work. Their hitting elements pierce the fuselage of a missile or drone, the missile loses its aerodynamic features and falls down. Its warhead does not necessarily explode upon impact with an anti-aircraft missile. Meaning, this warhead and the fragments of the anti-aircraft missile fall to the ground.\"\n\nBackground: With incredible efforts, the Ukrainian air defence system shot down 84 Russian drones at night of the two days of the New Year celebration, demonstrating 100% results.\n\nAt the same time, the Air Force emphasises that Ukraine will need more air defence systems to effectively counter these weapons with such an intensity of the invaders.\n\nJournalists fight on their own frontline.

{"text": "Boeing's latest 747 Jumbo Jet has been launched from the factory, ending more than 50 years of production, and this iconic aircraft has revolutionized air travel. The last LN-25 chartered cargo plane was delivered from the Boeing plant in Everett, Washington to an aircraft leasing and trading company based in Singapore. Its final journey marks the end of the 747 era, and the iconic aircraft will now be sent to aviation history. The 747 first flew \"Queen of the Sky\" in 1969, and since then has transported millions of passengers around the world, revolutionizing air travel. Due to its huge size, it can introduce the first ever wide-body cabin, allowing passengers to stretch and enjoy more leg space than ever before. The 747 was so popular that, at its peak, Boeing produced more than 1,500 aircraft. This aircraft is a symbol of wealth and luxury, and has been used by celebrities and world leaders, including the President of the United States. As airlines began to focus on shorter point-to-point flights, the 747's position in the market gradually weakened. In 2016, Boeing announced that it had officially ended production of the 747 for nearly 50 years. The last \"Queen of Sky\" will now be assigned to a less charming role, with the new owner planning to use the 747 for cargo and freight transportation. But its legacy will continue in the coming years, thanks to its many contributions to the aviation industry. The delivery of the last 747 was both a sad and joyful moment. While it marked the end of an era, it was also a celebration of the aircraft's achievements in its more than 50 years of production operation. \"The 747 brings people together and changes the way they travel,\" said Mark Allen, president of Boeing Commercial Aircraft. \"It's the most famous aircraft ever built and still holds a special place in the hearts of aviation enthusiasts around the world.\" For all critics, the 747 has left an impressive legacy that will not be forgotten any time soon. Therefore, while it may be the end of the 747, its iconic status as \"the Queen of the Sky\" will remain unchanged for years to come.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Not only did Green Bay Packers take a big step toward the postseason bar on Sunday night - they shouted loudly to let the world hear it. Aaron Rogers threw four touch-to-the-ground passes, Aaron Jones and Jamal Williams combined nearly 200 jump pitches, and the packer's defense made Minnesota quarterback Kirk Cousins look ordinary when he beat the Vikings at 24-17. This victory brings the Packers (11-3) closer to getting a place in the playoffs, and if the team can continue to show the kind of advantage they showed on Sunday night, they can go into deep games in January. Rogers was a Minnesota star, completing 22 of the 28 passes, lasting 230 yards and making four shots down without interception. He did all this without his first two broadband receivers, Davante Adams and Allen Lazard, who were both inactive due to injuries. His favorite target is Robert Tonic, who has won six 98 yards of high-end receptions and two touchdown points in his career. Tonyan, who has been quiet for most of the season, is becoming one of the top tighters in the league, and his performance on Sunday night should help him earn the respect he deserves. Jones, who recovered from an injury last week, carried the ball 15 times and 70 yards, while Williams picked up 79 yards and shot down 15 times. The two maintained Viking defense all night together. After weeks of struggle, they made the attack by their cousins and Vikings look commonplace. The cousins were held in only 172 aisles and one touchdown, while the packers' defense forced three rotations - one weak and two interceptions. The victory for the Vikings was huge for the Packers, which should help them get a place in the playoffs. However, they are far from being locked up right now, as there are still two tough games on their schedule. For now, however, packagers can enjoy the fact that they are only one line away from securing a postseason berth. They did it in style on Sunday night, beating the Vikings.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Elon Musk's SpaceX company is reportedly preparing for a massive financing, which could put the space exploration company at a valuation of up to $137 billion. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, the round of funding led by Andreessen Horowitz could raise as much as $750 million. In addition to Andresson, the report noted that investment companies such as Fidelity Investments, Tiger Global Management and Sequoia Capital are expected to participate in the financing. The money could be one of the largest investments ever made in a private venture capital firm. SpaceX is known for sending satellites, astronauts and cargo into space, but its ambition goes far beyond exploration. According to the report, the company's goal is to use large small satellite networks to build Internet networks in the atmosphere. The report adds that the company's other potential investments include Starship, which hopes to one day be able to transport people and cargo to rocket systems on the Moon, Mars and elsewhere. In addition, the company is developing an advanced version of its rocket launch system that can carry payloads from Earth to the upper atmosphere at speeds of more than 20,000 miles per hour. The company is currently estimated to be worth $74 billion, but a new round of funding could cause its valuation to soar. Some of the company's businesses have come under fire for air pollution, most notably a rocket launched in 2015 that polluted the atmosphere with Nitrogen Oxide and Nitrogen Oxide gas. The company has also faced controversy over its contracts with government agencies such as the National Reconnaissance Service and the U.S. Air Force. However, these criticisms have not slowed the company's progress. Over the past year, SpaceX has made many achievements, including the launch of the world's most powerful rocket Falcon Heavy and the successful launch of the Crew Dragon space capsule to the International Space Station. The company is now looking to expand its business operations, trading with companies and institutions around the world. An increase of $750 million in funding as well as a potential valuation of $137 billion could provide SpaceX with the capital it needs to continue delivering services to stars.", "label": "machine"}

But later, she says, her luck changed: She and Farah found an affordable three-bedroom apartment in the heart of the metropolitan area, close to parks, restaurants and other entertainment venues. \"There's a three-bedroom, at a very reasonable price, and that's exactly what we need to leave our parents' house,\" Gabriela said. Gabriela and Farah are among the many Puerto Rican Millennials facing the housing burden challenge in San Juan. According to reports from El Nuevo Dia and the Institute of Statistics of Puerto Rico, the average rental price for one-bedroom apartments in metropolitan areas was $718 and the average rent for two-bedroom apartments was $955 in 2019. The report also shows that in San Juan, the average cost of a home is about $140,000 and could be as high as $250,000. Gabriela, who currently earns $1,000 a month, thinks the ideal scenario is to find a place where she can save money and eventually become a homeowner. \"We finally found an affordable apartment, we pay a fixed rent of $1,000 per month, and it's a three-bedroom apartment,\" she said. Gabriela said their biggest priority was finding a safe place to live, close to the city centre, and that the price wouldn't leave them with very little money to pay for other expenses. \"We both have plenty of space, and there's also a room that can be used as a family office,\" she said. For those looking for an affordable and flexible lifestyle in the metropolitan area of Puerto Rico, renting is a great option.The most important thing is to do your research and know exactly what you are looking for in apartments. \"It's important to know exactly what you can afford and look for affordable options,\" Gabriela suggests. Gabriela is a living proof that you don't need money to find a safe and comfortable place to call home. For her, the most important thing is to stick to your needs, do your homework, and find the right choice. Now, after living in her own space for two years, Gabriela advises young Puerto Ricans to look for an affordable place to rent a home, considering not only the price but also the location and facilities of the area. \"We're living in the city centre and saving a lot of money and time, which is worth the effort,\" she said. Gabriela and Farah are examples of the young generation in Puerto Rico who are looking for ways to realize their dream of independence.

{"text": ".. According to a report released this morning by energy research firm Platts, gas prices in Europe have reached pre-war levels in Ukraine. The news shows that the European market is emerging from a turbulent period and provides momentum for gas producers in the region. At the height of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Russia cut off gas supplies to Europe in an attempt to gain influence in the dispute. This led to a spike in natural gas prices across the continent as countries scrambled to find alternative sources of fuel. The sharp rise in prices has prompted many European countries to look for new ways to reduce their dependence on Russian gas and invest in alternative energy sources. This has led to a rapid expansion of renewable energy projects, as well as increased investment in shale gas exploration. At the same time, negotiations between the EU and Russia over natural gas supplies continue. While the original agreement was not implemented, a subsequent agreement eventually brought gas supplies back online. The agreement also provides some stability for the European energy market, and Platz now reports that gas prices have returned to pre-war levels. While prices still fluctuate occasionally, the overall trend is positive. Stability in European gas markets has also been welcomed by producers in the region. Restoring confidence in supply has prompted several companies to invest in new projects, including shale exploration and some renewable energy initiatives. This is also good news for European consumers, as lower prices will help reduce their energy bills. In addition, the news may also provide a boost to Europe's economy, as increased investment in energy infrastructure will lead to job creation and economic growth. At present, European energy markets seem to be beginning to recover to pre-war levels in Ukraine, a welcome sign that the region has finally emerged from turbulent times. Many in the energy industry, as well as consumers and governments across the continent, have welcomed this development. While the immediate impact may be limited, restoring stability to energy prices could only be the beginning of a period of sustained economic growth. However, it is important to note that the situation remains fragile and that European energy markets are still likely to be affected by the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Only time will tell if European gas prices can remain stable in the long run. At the same time, today's news is certainly positive for Europe's energy markets.", "label": "machine"}

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nA snowy owl that looks like it should be flying about the wintry wizarding world of Harry Potter has been spotted among the palm trees of beachy Southern California.\n\nSnowy owls are native to the Arctic tundra, where their largely white coats camouflage them in the snow, according to the National Audubon Society, which protects birds across the Americas.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re most common in very, very North Canada,\u201d said Jaret Davey, a wildlife technician and volunteer coordinator at the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center in Huntington Beach, California. \u201cThe southern limit of their winter range is in the northern United States. So it\u2019s not uncommon for them to be in Washington or Minnesota or Maine in the winter. But to be this far south is really exceptional.\u201d\n\nPictured is the snowy owl perched on a rooftop in a neighborhood in Cypress, California, on December 31, 2022. David Crane/MediaNews Group/Los Angeles Daily News/Getty Images\n\nResidents in a neighborhood in Cypress, California \u2014 about 25 miles south of downtown Los Angeles \u2014 got a Christmas miracle when the owl first appeared in mid-December. It has been spotted every day since December 27.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s astonishing to see a snowy owl in Southern California,\u201d said Chris Spurgeon, program chair and member of the board of directors at the Pasadena Audubon Society, a local chapter of the National Audubon Society serving the Greater Pasadena area of California.\n\nSpurgeon and Davey aren\u2019t alone in their excitement. There have been hundreds of people admiring the owl some days, and some have traveled hundreds of miles, Davey said.\n\n\u201cIn February \u2026 I flew to Manitoba (Canada), and then drove several hours north just to see a snowy owl,\u201d Davey said. \u201cIt was 25 degrees below zero in northern Canada. I never thought I\u2019d see one standing in my shirtsleeves on a suburban street in 70-degree weather.\u201d\n\nSnowy owls are classified as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources\u2019 2021 Red List of Threatened Species. There are fewer than 500,000 snowy owls in the world, which isn\u2019t a huge number \u201cwhen it comes to birds,\u201d Spurgeon said.\n\n\u201cWe could be vastly wrong with that number because they do live so far away from most people,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd unfortunately, many birds are threatened by climate change. With the changing conditions in the Arctic, it\u2019s affecting them as well as everyone else.\u201d\n\nOrigin story unknown\n\nNo one knows exactly why and how the West Coast snowy owl got to a place so far from its natural habitat, but bird experts have a few theories.\n\n\u201cBirds that migrate do occasionally do crazy things: go in the wrong direction, go too far, migrate at the wrong time of year, stuff like that,\u201d Spurgeon said.\n\nThis can also happen if a bird is young and hasn\u2019t migrated many times before, Davey said. The brown spots on snowy owls\u2019 feathers usually get wider as they age, so the size of the California owl\u2019s spots suggest it could have been born within the last couple years, Spurgeon said.\n\nThe owl could have hitched a ride on a passing cargo ship while flying across the sea, went all the way to a seaport and found itself back on land, Spurgeon and Davey said. It also could have escaped from being illegally kept as a pet.\n\n\u201cOftentimes with really beautiful animals like the snowy owl, people will get them on a black market and then illegally keep them as pets,\u201d Davey said. However, he said the owl did not appear to have a leg band, clipped talons or clipped wings that would suggest they had been kept in captivity.\n\nThis snowy owl\u2019s future\n\nWhen Spurgeon saw the snowy owl, it didn\u2019t look emaciated or unhealthy, he said. But some birdwatchers did think the owl might have been experiencing symptoms of heat stress during the first couple of days, Davey said.\n\n\u201cIt looked like it was breathing really heavy. Its feathers were all fluffed up to try to shed heat,\u201d Davey added. \u201cSince then, it seems to have been doing just fine.\u201d\n\nSouthern California is relatively cold now, but the owl could be at risk when the weather warms up in the spring, Davey said.\n\nSnowy owls are carnivores and typically eat small rodents \u2014 especially lemmings \u2014 but can eat animals as big as geese, Davey said.\n\nWith parks, open fields and grasslands nearby, experts think the owl shouldn\u2019t have difficulty finding food during its stay. In fact, there has already been evidence that the owl has been eating well \u2014 in a pellet the owl regurgitated, staff at the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center found a whole skeleton of what might have been a gopher.\n\n\u201cAll owls do regurgitate small little pellets just of indigestible material because, unlike us, where (when) we eat a piece of meat we eat around the bone, birds of prey just eat the whole thing,\u201d Davey said. \u201cFor the small little bones they can\u2019t digest, they just cough it back up.\u201d", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI is set to have his funeral on Thursday morning at 9:30 a.m. (CET). He died in Vatican City on Dec. 31 at the age of 95.\n\nBenedict XVI\u2019s body was transferred to St. Peter\u2019s Basilica on Monday, where it will remain for the lying in state through Jan. 4. Hundreds of thousands have already visited and viewing is open until 7 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nPope Benedict XVI\u2019s passing comes after 10 years in papal retirement, during which he lived at the Mater Ecclesiae Monastery in the Vatican Gardens. The pope emeritus was the first pope in 600 years to resign from office in February 2013, saying that he had to acknowledge his \u201cincapacity to adequately fulfill the ministry entrusted\u201d to him.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know about his funeral.\n\nWhere and when is his funeral?\n\nPope Benedict will be interred in a traditional cypress casket, and then carried into St. Peter\u2019s Square on Thursday at 8:45 a.m., for the recital of the rosary about 45 minutes before the mass.\n\nPope Francis will preside over the funeral mass, though Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re will be the main celebrant at the altar.\n\nLive streams of the funeral will be available on the Vatican\u2019s Youtube Channel.\n\nWho is expected to attend?\n\nMore than 60,000 people are expected to attend the funeral.\n\nDelegations representing Germany (Benedict\u2019s home country) and Italy were invited to attend the funeral, per a statement from the Holy See Press Office.\n\nKing Philippe and Queen Mathilde of Belgium confirmed they will attend the ceremony. As did Queen Sofia of Spain, who is going in representation of her son, King Felipe. Other heads of state, including the presidents of Poland, Germany and Hungary are also expected to attend, according to the Catholic News Agency.\n\nJoe Donnelly, U.S. ambassador to the Holy See, will also be present, in a decision that White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said was in line with the wishes of the late Pope and the Vatican.\n\nCardinals and archbishops from several countries will also be expected to attend.\n\nWhat to expect from the service\n\nVatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni told the press that the funeral service will be simple to honor the wishes of Pope Benedict.\n\nAnd since Benedict XVI was not the reigning pope at the time of his death, there will be some changes to his memorial service. Most significantly, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) reports, two final prayers from the diocese of Rome and the Eastern rite churches will not be recited because these are specifically meant to honor a presiding pope.\n\n\u201cThe liturgical celebration follows the model of a funeral service for a supreme pontiff,\u201d Bruni told the press on Tuesday. New elements to the funeral will instead be added to give the ceremony \u2018its originality.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe first reading, for instance, will be from the Book of Isaiah, instead of a passage from the Acts of Apostles, as it was at St. John Paul II\u2019s funeral. The second reading will also be distinct, with a passage from the first letter of St. Peter that discusses the eternal life promised to God\u2019s children.\n\nFollowing the mass, Benedict\u2019s casket will be sealed and wrapped with ribbons before it is placed into two more caskets of zinc and wood, per the USCCB.\n\nWhere is he being buried?\n\nPope Benedict XVI will be buried in Pope John Paul\u2019s II first tomb, which is less than 100 feet from the Tomb of St. Peter. (John Paul II was moved to a chapel in the basilica in 2011 after he was beatified).\n\nA \u201crogito,\u201d or one-page scroll accounting the highlights of Benedict\u2019s papacy will be placed into a metal cylinder and into his coffin for burial, along with medals, palliums and Vatican coins minted during his reign, according to the USCCB..\n\nThe final moments of Benedict XVI\u2019s burial will be done in private.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Authorities said six people were killed in a horrific three-car crash along the Texas Highway on Tuesday morning. The accident occurred on Interstate 10 near Beaumont, about two hours east of Houston. Beaumont Police Lt. Joe Kraly said the crash occurred when a truck carrying five passengers crossed the midline on the West Passage and collided with the SUV's front on the East Passage. The driver of the SUV and all five passengers on board were killed, while the driver of the third vehicle was not injured. Clary said no other vehicles were involved, nor was alcohol considered a factor in the accident. The identity of the victims has not been released, and the cause of the accident is still under investigation. \"This is a tragic event that affects all of us,\" Clary said. \"We would like to express our condolences to all families involved and ask for the public's patience as the investigation continues.\" Kraly said the accident occurred around 5:45 a.m. local time and that the highway was closed for several hours after the crash, as police and emergency personnel were working to investigate the accident and clean up the wreckage. Clary said the van was carrying all five passengers, who were believed to be from the same family. He said the group travelled from Houston to Beaumont, but it was not clear why. He said the SUV was rented and the driver was not in the area. The Texas Department of Public Safety has opened an investigation into the crash, and authorities have said they will work closely with the National Transportation Safety Board to determine the cause of the accident. It is not known how fast the vehicle was driving at the time of the accident, or whether anyone wore a seatbelt. Clary said it was not clear if there were any traffic cameras or other surveillance equipment on the road that might have captured footage of the crash. If such a video existed, he said, it would be used as part of an investigation. The crash is the latest tragedy on Texas Highways this year. In March, a fatal accident at Interstate 35 near Austin left six dead and 11 injured, blamed on an incorrect driver. In April, two people were killed in a car crash on Interstate 30 near Dallas. Clary said the Beaumont accident is another reminder of how important it is to follow road rules and always be vigilant while driving. \"Our roads can be dangerous, and we must always be careful when driving,\" he said. \"We urge everyone to practice safe driving habits and take care of their surroundings whenever they are on the road.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Russian lawmakers appear to be risking an outflow of IT professionals, proposing a new law that could force large numbers of employees to work remotely. On December 29, 2020, the Russian Ministry of Labor and Social Security drafted and submitted to the State Duma a new legislation called the Digital Labour Code, which aims to expand the scope of the labor law to include remote workers and freelancers. Under the bill, employers will be able to require some employees to work remotely, which could affect millions of professionals in the IT industry. The law would also give employers the power to issue decisions on remote work and require workers to compensate for any losses resulting from such work. At the same time, the law also allows employers to impose sanctions on remote workers who do not meet their employer's expectations. These sanctions range from fines to dismissals. The proposed legislation has sparked strong opposition from Russian IT workers, who fear it will lead to lower wages and job security. They fear that the legislation will make it easier for employers to abuse power and exploit remote workers, thereby reducing wages and job security for those who cannot or do not want to move to new locations. The draft legislation has also been criticized for the potential to prevent foreign investment. Allowing employers to force employees to work remotely could lead to a decrease in foreign investment, as investors may be cautious about investing in countries where employees' rights are limited. Opponents of the draft legislation say it not only violates workers' rights but also undermines the competitiveness of Russia's IT sector. If employers can make it easier to hire remote workers, they are more likely to recruit abroad because wages in countries such as India, China and Romania are significantly lower than those in Russia. This could lead to a \"brain drain\" of Russian IT professionals, as those who have the ability to find jobs abroad will leave the country in search of higher wages. The potential consequences of this draft legislation are far-reaching and could eventually lead to a decline in innovation and productivity in the country. The fact that the draft legislation had been introduced during the pandemic would only add to the concerns of those in the information technology sector, since it appeared to be an attempt to perpetuate the remote working arrangements introduced in response to the pandemic. The proposed legislation has been criticized by many different groups, including the business community, trade unions and civil society. These critics argue that the legislation does not take into account the different needs of employers and workers, nor does it provide sufficient protection for workers' rights. Since the proposed legislation appears to be a response to the pandemic, consideration may need to be given to how it can be adapted to address the long-term impact of the pandemic and how it can be implemented in a way that guarantees workers &apos; rights. Russian lawmakers appear to be ignoring IT professionals' concerns and may risk an IT professional exodus by introducing a law that could lead to large numbers of employees being forced to work remotely. If implemented, the law could lead to lower wages, job security and foreign investment in the country, as well as a potential \"brain drain\" of Russian IT professionals. Any teleworking legislation must be accompanied by strong protections for workers' rights to ensure that Russia's IT sector remains competitive and innovative.", "label": "machine"}

The world's seventh-ranked player has long taken control of the situation, maintaining his right to play in the first four games and creating two break points in the opening game. But the Czech veteran immediately broke Sabalenka's right to play, then doubled his advantage by 6:3. But Sabalenka reshaped his state in the second set, hitting a clear shot and finding the corner of the court more accurately as Siniakova struggled to keep up.

{"text": "Mistakes in the management of funds are very common. Whether it's bad decisions, bad advice, or simply not doing research results, these mistakes can be costly - and in some cases even catastrophic. Unfortunately, not learning from your mistakes is not an option, but taking the time to recognize and resolve them is a key step in avoiding more costly mistakes. As we approach the end of the year, this is a particularly important time to reassess your financial strategy and avoid these too common financial errors. Unable to track your expenses The only way to truly understand your financial situation is to track your spending. Of course, this isn't always a simple task and may require some effort and discipline, but this step is crucial for making an informed decision about how to allocate the money you have worked so hard to earn. Not tracking your spending, whether on vacation or at any time of year, can be a costly mistake. Fortunately, budget apps and programs can easily monitor your spending, so there's no reason not to pay attention to your financial situation. By taking the time to track your funds, you will be better able to make sound financial decisions, such as when to invest, save or buy something. No contingency fund available It's important to have a backup plan in the event of life-changing events such as unemployment, medical emergencies or unexpected car repairs. However, a recent study by the Federal Reserve found that 40% of Americans don't have enough money to cover $400 in emergency spending. Financial experts often recommend setting aside living expenses for 3 to 6 months in the contingency fund, which not only provides a buffer against an emergency but also prevents you from paying off debt. To make saving easier, consider setting up automatic transfers to your contingency fund on a monthly basis. Excessive indebtedness. Debt, while sometimes inevitable, quickly spirals out of control. High interest debt such as credit cards is particularly problematic and should be eliminated as soon as possible. In addition, try paying more than the minimum amount each month as this will help you pay off your debt faster and save interest. However, if debt payments become unmanageable, consider seeking help through a non-profit credit advisory organization such as the National Credit Advisory Foundation. Don't Diversify Your Investments Investment is a good way to achieve financial growth and increase net assets, but it's important to be strategic. While significant returns can be made from a single high-risk investment, diversifying portfolios through hybrid investments is often the best path to a solid financial future. When it comes to diversifying your investment, look at different types of investments such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange traded funds (ETFs) and real estate. The idea is to allocate money between different asset classes and industries so that if you have an investment pool, you still have other investments that are more likely to perform well. Retirement is not a priority. Retirement savings should always be a priority, but many Americans delay this important step and instead choose to spend their money on other things. However, failing to prepare for retirement can lead to financial hardship. Fortunately, there are several retirement savings tools that can help you build a nest egg, including 401(k)s, IRA and even a healthy savings account. The sooner you start using these options, the better it will be when you retire. Don't go shopping for the best prices and deals. Whether you are borrowing, registering for a credit card or signing a service contract, it is important to compare different lenders, cards and offers to find the best deals. In the long run, if you don't buy the best prices and benefits, you will end up paying more because some of them have better terms than others. Fortunately, finding the best offer has become easier than ever compared to comparison sites, which allows you to quickly compare multiple offers and make informed decisions.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "MSI today announced the powerful Raider GE78 gaming laptop at CES 2023, and we were able to go hands-on with the system prior to its announcement to bring you our impressions.\n\nThis is a sizable gaming laptop focused on power, so expect a larger chassis with the latest features and powerful components over portability. Check out the video above for our first look, and read on for the details.\n\nA 17-Inch, Performance-First Design\n\nThe Raider GE78 isn\u2019t the most powerful option in MSI\u2019s lineup\u2014leave that to the company\u2019s monstrous Titan laptop (the last Titan model we reviewed is here, and a new edition is also coming in 2023)\u2014but it is the more reasonable next step down. At 17 inches and 6.6 pounds, the Raider is far more about power and performance than portability, so you should eye this as a desktop replacement that can move when you need it to. There\u2019s also a smaller Raider GE68.\n\n(Credit: Kyle Cobian)\n\nBeyond the size, let's first talk about the style. It\u2019s mostly black, though there is some chic copper trim on the rear. The single most eye-catching facet, though, is by far the front-facing LED matrix light bar. This is an evolution of the front edge lighting we've seen before, as on the Raider GE67 HX.\n\n(Credit: Kyle Cobian)\n\nThis light bar is customizable with MSI\u2019s Mystic Light software utility, bringing a load of flash to an otherwise pretty restrained design. The bold LEDs pop more than the traditional style, and while that will probably be divisive to a degree, there\u2019s no denying it will grab the attention of anyone in sight of this notebook. The lid logo is also RGB lit, and the keyboard features per-key customizable lighting as well.\n\nA Spacious Screen and High-End Parts for a Desktop-Like Experience\n\nMoving on to that big display, it\u2019s available with a QHD+ 240Hz panel, or a 4K 120Hz version. The screen is sharp, very roomy, and ready for gaming at either resolution, though you\u2019ll really need to go for broke in terms of top-end components for gaming on a 4K 120Hz panel. And I do mean \u201cgo for broke\u201d: the top configurations for this laptop are around $4,000.\n\n(Credit: Kyle Cobian)\n\nNow, as for what those models will pack inside, precise details aren\u2019t available just yet, but the Raider will feature components from the top half of Nvidia and Intel\u2019s 2023 silicon stacks. Particularly in those souped-up or maxed-out configurations that cost around $4,000, this machine should deliver a high-fidelity laptop gaming experience. We\u2019ll have to test the performance ourselves to confirm that when we can, but it\u2019s clear even on paper that this is far from a budget gaming option.\n\n(Credit: Kyle Cobian)\n\nFinally, the Raider includes some other notable features, like a dedicated MUX switch, which allows the GPU to send display data directly through to the panel for increased performance. This switch also lets you manually toggle the integrated graphics on and off. The Raider is packed with a 99.9 watt-hour battery, though we still wouldn\u2019t expect battery life to be great on this big system, and features a full HD IR camera with Windows Hello.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Idaho Police released shocking court documents revealing new details of the case involving the deaths of three family members. On July 15, 2019, Chad Daybell and Lori Vallow were arrested for the disappearance of her two children, Tylee Ryan and JJ Vallow, who were later found dead in the backyard of Chad Daybell's home in Salem, Idaho. In addition to the missing children, two other deaths - Lori Vallo's divorced husband Charles Vallo and her brother Alex Cox - are also under investigation. Now, the police have released court documents to learn more about this mysterious case. According to these documents, a roommate from the families of the three deceased told police that he heard someone crying and saw a masked man in his residence on the morning of the day of the murder. The roommate said he was living with Charles Wallow, Alex Cox and Lori Vallow at the time of the murder. He told police that on July 11, 2019, around 3 a.m., he heard someone crying in his next room. Then he got up to see what had happened but didn't see anyone. The man said he heard the door shut a few minutes later and went back to bed.The next morning, he told police that he saw a man wearing a ski mask in the driveway. He said the man was tall, short-haired and wore a brown jacket. He said the man was entering a silver car and driving away. The roommate told police he heard Charles Vallow quarrel with a woman that morning. He said he heard the woman say \"Don't do it, don't do it!\" The court documents also show that there was a surveillance camera inside the home in the place of the murder. Surveillance video shows two cars entering the lane shortly after the fight, one of which was a silver car, consistent with the description provided by the roommate. The court documents did not specify who was in the car, and the investigation is still ongoing. Police are also investigating whether there is any link between the deaths of these three family members and Chad Daybell, Lori Vallow's fifth husband, who is currently in prison awaiting trial for concealing the deaths of Tylee Ryan and JJ Vallow. Both Vallo and De Bell are scheduled to appear in court next month for preliminary hearings, and the Tribunal's documents provide prosecutors with another layer of information that can be used in trials. The mysterious case shocked a small community in Salem, Idaho, where the three family members were killed. Residents said the murder caused a wave of panic in the town as police continued to investigate the case. If convicted, both Vallow and Daybell could face the death penalty. At the same time, court documents provide more clues to a case that has drawn national attention.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "It's no secret that universities are expensive. Tuition fees have soared, leaving many students and families in unbearable debt. For some, going to college is simply not economically viable. The rise in tuition fees, coupled with rising costs of living and textbooks and other supplies, may be too heavy for some students and their families. Many potential students are turning to online courses and other forms of education that can provide them with the same value at a fraction of the cost. In addition, some students are looking for alternatives such as coding camps or accelerated degree programs. In an era when technology is increasingly becoming the way of the future, skills such as coding and engineering can be acquired more quickly through training camps and other forms of short-term training. This alternative approach allows students to acquire the skills they need to make an immediate impact in the job market. Some students may find that the traditional college experience is simply not for them. The academic and social atmosphere of a university may not be suitable for some students. For those seeking more focused and specialized experiences, conventional college education may no longer be an attractive option. It's also important to note that some students may skip college because of the stigma that comes with it. For some, college is seen as a measure of success or failure and a reflection of their intelligence or ability. The tendency to drop out is particularly prevalent among minority students, many of whom come from low-income families struggling to make ends meet. Moreover, many of these students may not have access to the same level of academic resources as their peers, leading them to believe that college may not be the best option. As costs rise and attitudes toward education shift, it's clear that traditional college education is no longer the only way to succeed. It's important for students and parents to explore all of their options in order to make the best decisions for their future.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "KUALA - Before Malaysia's much-anticipated national election, political opponents took a straight line in the campaign, with many focusing on the country's biggest scandal - 1MDB. The Development Bank of Malaysia (1MDB) is a government-controlled entity established in 2009 to transform Malaysia into a global financial and investment hub. However, it is heavily scrutinized and accused of mismanagement and corruption. The U.S. Department of Justice said that $4.5 billion was diverted from 1MDB between 2009 and 2014. Since then, the scandal has become a major campaign issue in Malaysia, with both sides accusing each other of being involved in the scandal and not taking enough action to recover funds stolen from 1MDB. The ruling coalition, led by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and his Baqatan Harapan (PH) party, seized the opportunity to demonstrate its commitment to eradicating corruption and mismanagement in the country. It also sought to portray its rival, the Malay National Union Organization (UMNO) and its coalition Barisan National Party (BN), as responsible for the scandal and its aftermath. At the same time, the opposition used the scandal to attack the ruling coalition, accusing them of not doing enough to address the problem. The opposition also tried to distance itself from anyone involved in the scandal. To further demonstrate its commitment to fighting corruption and misconduct, the PH government conducted a series of investigations into 1MDB and its associated entities. The government also pledged to recover some of the funds diverted from 1MDB. The Government also sought to reassure investors that it had taken steps to strengthen corporate governance and address the issue. Meanwhile, the opposition tried to prove that PH was politicizing the 1MDB scandal and did not take sufficient steps to recover the abused funds. The opposition also argued that the government was too slow to act and its investigations were insufficiently comprehensive. They also accused the government of using the 1MDB scandal to divert attention from its own record of corruption and transparency. In recent weeks, the two sides have clashed over how to deal with the consequences of 1MDB. UMNO and its allies have criticized the PH government's efforts to hold accountable those responsible and recover improper funds. The opposition argued that the government's approach was too slow and did not take enough measures to crack down on 1MDB-related corruption. The government countered, accusing the opposition of not taking a hard line on the scandal and trying to shift responsibility to others. In a recent speech, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said the government had done its best to investigate and recover funds stolen from 1MDB. He also said that the opposition has not taken enough action to support the government's efforts to address this issue. As national elections approach, the 1MDB scandal is likely to remain a major pre-census issue. Both sides may continue to use it as an election tool to win public support and denigrate each other's reputation. So far, the 1MDB scandal has cost Malaysia about $7.5 billion, and the country is still recovering misappropriated funds. How both sides deal with the scandal in the coming weeks could have a major impact on the perception of the Malaysian public and its record on corruption and transparency.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "In the world of social media, filters and photo editing apps are the norm, and a new app is opposing the way we present ourselves online. BeReal is a social media application that encourages users to be more authentic by banning edited photos. The app allows users to post only their own unedited photos and share real, unfiltered and heart-filled stories, opinions, and moments. The idea for the app comes from its creator, Shannon Harrington, who wants to create a platform that allows people to express themselves without having to rely on numbers to change their appearance as a stumbling block. \"I'm very frustrated with the way our society views beauty,\" says Harrington, \"I believe everyone is beautiful and editing photos takes that beauty away. I want BeReal to be a platform where people can be 100 percent proud of themselves.\" BeReal's mission is to eliminate filters and editing apps in the platform, which it says makes it difficult for people to truly accept who they are.To ensure that edited photos aren't posted in applications, the company uses sophisticated algorithms to detect and flag edited photos. If a photo is marked as edited, the user can choose to delete or keep it, but not publish it in front of the public until verified as unedited. The idea behind the app is to create a safe space where people can become their true selves without having to comply with social beauty standards. Users can create posts, stories and galleries of their true selves - all without any filters or editing. The app also has a community section where users can connect with each other and share stories and experiences.BeReal hopes that this will give users the opportunity to get to know each other more deeply and support each other's personal journey. So far, the app has received a positive response and is growing rapidly. Although not everyone agrees with this concept, most users seem to think it's a fresh air world where photo editing has become the norm. BeReal is part of a growing app, website and brand movement that encourages users to be more authentic and embrace their true self. This wave of self-love and acceptance is slowly but surely beginning to change the way we watch and present online.", "label": "machine"}

But they are much like ordering fries and a drink to go with a burger. They don't create an ecosystem that Apple can grow. They rely on the iPhone's ecosystem.\n\nIt has long been rumored that Apple will create a car to take on the likes of Tesla. That would be an example of a new market for Apple. But I don't think an Apple car is going to happen, and that's a topic for another time.\n\nWhat does seem likely is that Apple will release augmented-reality/virtual-reality glasses, rumored to be coming in 2023 with an OS called xrOS.\n\nWhile I'm always excited to see what innovations companies like Apple have in store, I have some serious concerns about betting on AR/VR glasses as a growth market.\n\nWe've already seen some attempts in this space, including Microsoft HoloLens and Magic Leap. They have not exactly taken the world by storm. When was the last time you or anyone you know saw someone using those devices at their places of work or out in the wild? Glass from Google, I think it's safe to say, was a failure. And Snapchat's Spectacles are not even for sale to the general public, the company's website says, only to developers.\n\nThen there are VR products like Oculus from Meta and competitors from Valve, Sony, and HP. These have made some inroads with gamers, but years after they were introduced, they're still a small fraction of the enormous video-gaming market.\n\nAs for other uses? We have, so far, seen none, despite Mark Zuckerberg's die-hard belief that the metaverse is the future of our social lives and work meetings and whatnot.\n\nThere is a belief, however, that Apple \u2014 which isn't usually first to market \u2014 can enter a space and succeed where no one has before.\n\nWhen it comes to this market, I'm more than a little skeptical. First and foremost, the battery life of an AR device is a major concern. AR, as Google Glass and Snapchat Spectacles envisioned it, is meant to be worn for long periods of time and superimpose digital imagery and functions onto the real world.\n\nWhile Apple has not released specifications on this front (or any other), it seems highly unlikely that any device in this category will work for extended periods without recharging. Plus, despite all the ways that Apple is a leader in elegant hardware design, battery life is not really its strong point. (In the world of smartwatches, for example, some Garmin devices last as long as two weeks, reviewers found, while an Apple Watch, in my experience, gives a user two or three days.)\n\nThere's also the question of comfort. Glasses are not the most comfortable things to wear for extended periods of time. And when you add the weight and bulk of the technology needed for AR and VR, eyewear like this become more uncomfortable to wear.\n\nThis is not to mention the fact that many people simply do not like wearing glasses at all, which will limit the market for these products.\n\nPrice is another major issue. Microsoft's HoloLens costs between $3,500 and $5,200. Apple's device is widely expected to be in the $1,000 to $1,500 price range, even though Apple is known for selling premium devices with premium price tags. But even on the low end, that's a significant investment for a product that will do far less than a comparably priced MacBook or iPad.\n\nBeyond the practical concerns of battery life, comfort, and price, there's the fundamental issue of the lack of a compelling use case for AR or VR glasses.\n\nWhile these technologies have some exciting potential, it is not yet clear, beyond certain types of video games, what the killer app will be to make them a must-have for consumers.\n\nAll that is to say, while Apple's AR/VR project may be interesting to die-hard Apple fans and tech enthusiasts who buy into Apple's marketing machine and wait in lines to buy its products on day one, I don't believe it's the company's next big thing.\n\nUntil Apple, or any other company, can demonstrate a truly compelling reason for large numbers of people to want to wear AR around, or add VR to their quiver of home-entertainment options, I fear that the tech will struggle to gain widespread adoption. There is a reason Oculus devices have created a category known as \"closetware,\" a gadget that winds up stored and forgotten somewhere in a closet.\n\nMichael Gartenberg is a former senior marketing executive at Apple and has covered the company for more than two decades as a market-research analyst at Gartner, Jupiter Research, and Altimeter Group.

{"text": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Dhara Ranasinghe\n\nForget peak U.S. interest rates for a minute, markets already want to know when the Federal Reserve will start making cuts -- later this year, if money market futures are to be believed.\n\nAny upcoming data, therefore, should be viewed in the context of that debate and the pushback investors are likely to get from Fed officials.\n\nIndeed, minutes from the Fed's December meeting, released on Wednesday, cautioned against expectations for late-year rate cuts that traders have priced in. And Gita Gopinath, a deputy managing director at the International Monetary Fund, warns U.S. inflation has not \"turned the corner yet\" and it is too early for the Fed to declare victory.\n\nMarkets, renowned for running ahead of time, are not buying that argument. They price in roughly 40 basis points worth of rate cuts in the second half of the year and the key is whether inflation will slow enough for the Fed to ease.\n\nEssential to that outlook is, of course, the labour market, putting Thursday's weekly jobs data, a precursor to Friday's closely-watched non-farm payrolls report, in the spotlight.\n\nThe December ADP National Employment report is released later on and economists polled by Reuters expect it to show private employment increased by 150,000 jobs after a 127,000 increase in November.\n\nNote, data on Wednesday showed U.S. job openings fell less than expected in November as the labour market remains tight, which could see the Federal Reserve boosting interest rates even more than currently anticipated to tame inflation.\n\nSo perhaps it is too early to be talking about rate cuts?\n\nMoving on, there are two other noteworthy factors to draw attention to.\n\nThe first is China's battle with COVID and what that means for the reopening of the economy. China on Thursday defended its handling of its raging COVID-19 outbreak after U.S. President Joe Biden voiced concern and the World Health Organization said Beijing was under-reporting deaths from the virus.\n\nSecond is a slump in energy prices. European gas prices are now at their lowest since late 2021, helping ease concern about a deep recession, especially in the euro area.\n\nStill, U.S. stock futures point to a weak start for Wall Street shares , and European shares are a touch softer too. But Asian shares, outside Japan, briefly touched a four-month high, driven by hopes over China reopening (.MIAPJ0000PUS).\n\nGas prices are falling fast\n\nKey developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Thursday:\n\n- U.S. Nov trade data.\n\n- Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic\n\n- Amazon CEO says job cuts to exceed 18,000 roles\n\nReporting by Dhara Ranasinghe; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n\nOpinions expressed are those of the author.

{"text": "Job openings fell in October as the Fed worked to cool a record-breaking labor market. The Labor Department said Wednesday that job openings in October decreased by 389,000, a decrease of 2.9% from the previous month.The number of vacancies in October was 12.87 million, down from 13.26 million in September. The job vacancy rate dropped after the Federal Reserve took a series of steps to cool the hot jobs market, including imposing caps on corporate buybacks and suspending stock dividends. These measures were designed to limit how much companies spend on their own stocks, rather than investing in jobs and wage growth. Last week, the U.S. Department of Labor said that the economy added 638,000 jobs in October, its highest monthly increase since a recovery began in May. The unemployment rate fell to 6.9% from 7.9% in September. But job growth has slowed in recent months, with the number of jobs rising by just 1.8 million over the past three months, down from more than 4 million in the previous three months. The pace of hiring has been hampered by a variety of factors, including a surge in coronavirus cases, electoral uncertainty and the lack of another round of federal stimulus. The number of unemployed in October was close to 11 million, with African American unemployment at 10.8%, Hispanic unemployment at 8.3% and Asian American unemployment at 6.7%. The Federal Reserve's efforts to cool the job market appear to be bearing fruit, with vacancies falling in recent months. It is not clear whether the Fed's efforts will be enough to slow down hiring over the coming months, or whether companies will continue recruiting as the economy recovers. The October job opening report also showed a significant decline in employment in some sectors of the economy. Construction, transportation and retail were hit hard, while jobs in government grew by 8.8%. The report also showed a 4.1 per cent decrease in job vacancies in the professional and business services sector, compared with a 1.2 per cent decline in jobs in education and health services. With fewer jobs, the U.S. economy is entering a period of slowing job growth and weakening wage growth. The economy still has some way to go before it returns to pre-pandemic employment levels, and efforts by the Federal Reserve to cool the job market could further slow down hiring.", "label": "machine"}

In 2018, he was arrested for practicing without a license after working as a doctor and opening a medical office in West Palm Beach, Florida. He was given a three-year suspended sentence and ordered to pay more than $35,000 in damages. In 2019, he pleaded guilty to theft, credit card fraud and practicing without a license for being caught pretending to be a doctor. He was given a two-year suspended sentence, ordered to pay more than $17,000, and banned from doing business using the Internet or any other device. When news of his arrest spread, Robinson became the target of online jokes and memoirs. He was often described as a \"medical school dropout\" and an \"anti-artist\". According to police reports, Love-Robinson has been working as a veterinary assistant at Animal Hospital since February 1. Surveillance video shows him leaving the hospital with a bag containing items belonging to the industry, including masks, antibiotics and $4,800 worth of narcotic drugs. When he confronted police, he admitted to theft and was detained. He is currently being held at Palm Beach County Jail on charges of stealing, indecent assault and burglary for more than $300. Although his lawyer did not comment on the case, Love-Robinson's family issued a statement saying they were \"deeply concerned and saddened by recent events.\" They said: \"We are working to provide all we can to help support our son in this difficult time and ask people to respect our family privacy during this difficult time.\" Robinson's recent arrest is only the latest in a series of criminal activities that have earned his country's attention. Whether it's pretending to be a doctor, fraud, or even stealing from an employer, he has repeatedly shown that he is willing to commit any crime for success. But one thing is certain, and his story is an important reminder: always do your research before you trust someone or hire someone. While not everyone is a liar, there are people who are willing to do anything for success, preferably make mistakes carefully.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Category: Books and books Meghan Markle didn't stop her from telling the story. The former Duchess of Sussex has shown that she had been thinking about writing a memoir to tell everyone, just before her husband Prince Harry's long-awaited book \"Looking for Freedom\" was published. Harry will be releasing his memoirs this summer and is expected to share some insider knowledge of his royal days. The news of Meghan's plan came after it was revealed earlier this week that she had secured a multimillion-dollar book deal for her highly anticipated autobiography. The deal was reportedly negotiated with publisher Penguin Random House, where the Duchess of Sussex is reported to be writing about her struggles during royal times and as a member of the public. The deal was reportedly completed in the early hours of Wednesday after weeks of negotiations. But with Harry's book about to be published, Meghan is reportedly considering spreading the beans on what really happened during her two-year tenure as a senior royal. According to one source, the Duchess is \"considering carefully\" and \"has been exploring various options.\" \"Meghan knows that any personal disclosure of the incident, either by herself or by Harry, could obscure the other party's book release. Both sides must carefully consider their own approach to ensure that each other's publication is not compromised,\" the source told The People. Meghan was reportedly considering the impact of any personal revelation on Harry's book, and the source added that \"the timing of any memoir is critical.\" It is believed that Harry's book, co-written with his friend and journalist Omid Scobie, will reveal many details about him and Meghan during the royal period. These include the couple's move to Los Angeles after serving as a senior royal, and what is known as a crack between Harry and his brother, Prince William. Harry's book is expected to be released in August, while Meghan has yet to announce a release date. Meanwhile, the former actress focuses on her charity's work at the Archival Foundation and spends time with her and Harry's one-year-old son, Archie Harrison. Since moving to Los Angeles at the end of last year, Meghan and Harry have kept a low profile. However, they made several public appearances, including in October when they participated in England's Invictus Games, which was a reason for their heart. It is believed that Harry and Meghan's book will go deep into the couple's royal exit story, but only time will tell which version of the story will be revealed.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "To attract new business to the area around Soldier Field, developers are urging the city of Chicago to explore the possibility of building a new dome stadium. A proposal presented to Mayor Lori Lightfoot by Richard M. Daley, head of the City's Stadium Development Corporation, and his team of investors suggested that a new dome stadium be built that could become the permanent home of the Chicago Bears while also serving as a major commercial hub. If approved, the stadium will be a state-of-the-art facility with a capacity of 65,000 people and has been described as a \"lifetime investment opportunity\" for the city of Chicago. The new stadium will be part of efforts to revive the surrounding area, for which the plan recommends that the city invest $1 billion in the construction of the dome stadium and its surrounding complex. The complex will include restaurants, shops, office spaces as well as entertainment and cultural venues.While the Bears will be the main tenant, the stadium will also be able to host other events such as concerts, conferences and special events. However, critics of the plan argue that the city should focus on other issues, such as public education or infrastructure, rather than investing in the dome stadium. They also point out that the proposed site is located south of Soldier Field, an already highly economically active area, and that the new stadium could adversely affect existing operations in the area. Mayor Lightfoot said in a statement that she was \"pleased to see private investment groups coming forward to create visions for an attractive destination in Chicago,\" but added that any plan of this scale would require thoughtful consideration and consideration from a variety of stakeholders. \"We have to be mindful of the impact on our neighborhoods and work closely with them in this process,\" Lightfoot said, adding: \"I will strive to ensure we make responsible investments that serve the public good and create jobs and economic opportunities for all Chicagoans.\" The proposal is part of a larger effort by Daly and his investment team to increase development in the area around Soldiers Field. It's also part of an effort to keep the Bears in Chicago, which has been considering moving outside the city for years. If approved, the Dome Stadium and its commercial complex could be completed as early as 2026, which is expected to bring hundreds of millions of dollars to the city in the form of taxes and jobs. For now, Mayor Lightfoot says her government will continue to study the proposal and look for ways to make it in the best interests of the city.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "According to Tom Lee, a Global Advisor at Fundstrat, Tesla (TSLA.O) shares have been \"oversold\" and dropped sharply in recent weeks, but it's too early to buy stock from the electric vehicle maker. Tesla's stock price has fallen more than 35% from its historic high of $858.50 on Jan. 26, hitting a six-month low of $553.58 last week. This decline brings the company's valuation closer to what it was a year ago when stocks were trading at around $340. Referring to CNBC's \"trading country,\" Lee said the stock price decline was due to a \"combination of fundamentals and concerns that some investors have begun to worry about\", noting that Tesla had \"not yet fully delivered on all its promises.\" However, analysts say it's too early to buy stocks. \"From my point of view, I think it's still too early to buy. I think we're still too close to the high for sure that Tesla can actually deliver,\" Li said. He pointed out that the company is about to release a revenue report, which will let investors know about the company's sales, production and guidance this year. \"The market needs something tangible to support and I think there's a pretty good chance that when we get this earnings report, it will be a catalyst for stock moves,\" he said. Li said Tesla's goal of producing 500,000 cars this year was \"at risk of being lost\", adding that if the company wants to restore stock prices, it needs to \"fulfill this and other commitments.\" The analyst did not give any specific price targets for the stock, but said: \"If you look at recent developments, I think it's sold too much.\" \"It may be an opportunity to start sliding, but we're not ready for the trigger yet,\" Lee said. Tesla shares fell this year amid concerns about slowing sales, the company's first quarter losses and delays in Model 3 production. Share prices rose slightly higher on Tuesday, up about 0.3%, as investors looked ahead to the company's upcoming earnings report to understand the company's future prospects. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv expect Tesla to lose $1.93 per share and generate $6.08 billion in revenue, and the company is expected to provide updated information on its production and delivery guidelines for this year. Tesla has been a volatile stock for many years, and the recent decline will only increase its reputation for wild fluctuations. Despite some recent declines, this year's shares have risen 81.1% to date, while the S&P 500 index rose 11.2%. Of the 30 analysts surveyed by Refinitiv, 19 were rated \"buy\" or \"strong buy,\" 8 were rated \"hold\", and 3 were rated \"sell.\" For its part, Tesla has been braging about its current production efforts, recently telling investors that it is making \"significant progress\" to reach its target of 500,000 units. The company's chief executive Elon Musk has been defending the company's long-term prospects, but he also acknowledged that Tesla's stock price is \"a bit high right now.\" When Tesla announces earnings on May 3, investors will pay attention to the latest developments in Tesla's production targets. Prior to this, Li said it was too early to buy shares.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Natia and Jervais Seegars both opened their first credit cards when they were college students.\n\nThey racked up debt and had terrible credit, which held them back from buying a home.\n\nThey turned their finances around by tracking their spending and boosting their income.\n\nNatia and Jervais Seegars both opened their first credit cards when they were college students in the early 2000s.\n\nLike many young students, they didn't fully understand how credit worked. In fact, the main reason Jervais got one was because the credit card company was giving away free T-shirts to any student who signed up for a card.\n\n\"I was like, 'Oh, this is a cool shirt. Let me sign up for it,' not really knowing what it actually meant,\" he recalled.\n\nNatia remembers receiving a credit card in the mail without ever applying for one, she told Insider: \"Back then, companies used to send you a credit card in the mail and you would just activate it if you wanted it.\"\n\nShe ended up activating it and using it to pay for books and art supplies for her classes. Even though she consistently paid the minimum on time, she couldn't afford to pay her balance in full every month, meaning she was gradually accumulating interest and going deeper and deeper into debt.\n\nJervais also racked up credit card debt. By the time the couple decided they wanted to buy a home together, they were $8,300 in the red and had \"terrible credit,\" they told Insider. Jervais' credit score was 524 at its lowest.\n\nTheir debt and low credit scores held them back from buying property right away. They didn't qualify for a loan, explained Jervais: \"We got a lot of 'no's' from lenders.\"\n\nThe couple met when they were college students. Courtesy of Natia and Jervais Seegars\n\nThat's when they got serious about turning their finances around. After three years of paying down their debt, increasing their income, and boosting their credit, they qualified for a home loan and bought their first property in 2006 in North Carolina, where they both went to college.\n\nThey have been expanding their portfolio ever since. Today, Natia, 41, and Jervais, 43, own five properties that bring in $30,000 in monthly revenue, according to documents viewed by Insider \u2014 and their credit scores are above 800, they noted. They currently reside in the Bay Area but still own the first home they ever bought and rent it out.\n\nTheir real estate business allowed them to recently quit their 9-to-5 jobs \u2014 Jervais was an engineer, while Natia worked in marketing \u2014 and launch a coaching business, YourLifeStyleStrategy, in 2022 to help other people build wealth through real estate.\n\nAs they learned first-hand, \"if your finances aren't in order, it's going to be a very bumpy road,\" said Jervais.\n\nHere are the three strategies that helped them get their finances in order.\n\n1. They tracked their spending and stuck to a budget\n\nThe first change Natia and Jervais made was tracking their expenses. They started by simply writing down everything they bought.\n\n\"A lot of people think that a budget has to be really sophisticated,\" said Natia. \"Ours was literally handwritten on graphing paper. Back then, it was super expensive to buy Excel for the computer, so we just manually wrote every expense down.\"\n\nTracking their purchases helped them understand where their money was going and where they could cut back. They left room for some discretionary spending, \"because we still wanted to enjoy ourselves,\" said Natia, but they shifted their definition of a \"splurge.\" For example, \"our date night tradition was going to Sam's Club for the $1.50 combo. We'd get a soda and a hotdog for $1.50 and call it a splurge.\"\n\nThey had to make some bigger sacrifices, like skipping family trips and reunions, she added: \"We would have liked to have participated but sometimes it didn't match our budget, and we were very clear on what we wanted to accomplish.\"\n\nPlus, they refrained from upgrading certain aspects of their lives right away. For example, they lived in the off-campus studio apartment Jervais had been renting as a college student for $495 a month and they shared one car.\n\n2. They picked up extra shifts at work to increase their income\n\nIn addition to spending less, Natia and Jervais both picked up extra hours to boost their incomes. At the time, they were both waiting tables. Natia had just graduated from college and was able to work full-time, while Jervais was still in school and worked part-time.\n\nThey also found a promotional gig with a gum company that paid pretty well, said Jervais: \"When Dentyne Ice first came out, it was the new gum. We went to the campuses at UNC Chapel Hill and Duke University to pass out free gum and promote the brand.\"\n\nBesides asking for extra hours and finding side gigs, they were both able to increase their main source of income. After graduating in 2005, Jervais started a full-time engineering job. That same year, Natia started working in marketing and went from an hourly wage plus tips at the restaurant to earning a salary.\n\nLater in their careers, the couple employed what they call \"the 1% rule,\" said Natia. \"We would try to increase our income by 1% a month \u2014 or, 12% a year \u2014 and we would come up with strategies, whether that was asking for a raise from our current jobs, getting a new job, or increasing the rent of our investment property in North Carolina.\"\n\n3. They automated their savings\n\nOnce Natia and Jervais landed their salary-based jobs and were earning more consistent paychecks, they set up automatic transfers from their checking accounts to their savings accounts.\n\nThey picked $300 a month because that's the most they could afford to save at the time, they explained, and automatically transferred it to an account earmarked for their home purchase.\n\nThat's ultimately what helped them save enough money for the down payment and closing costs that came with their first home.\n\nBy putting their savings on autopilot, they couldn't ever skimp out, they explained. No matter what, $300 went into savings each month and, over time, they learned to live without that money.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Pictured here is a science-fiction themed installation at the Maison Hermes in Shanghai, China, on Nov. 28, 2022. Future Publishing | Future Publishing | Getty Images\n\nBEIJING \u2014 Wealthier Chinese were more inclined to spend this year, while poorer people cut back on spending even more, McKinsey and Company found in a survey released Thursday. The divergence contrasts with 2019, before the pandemic, when \"there was little differentiation in spending between the two groups,\" the McKinsey analysts said. They noted an official measure of consumer sentiment in China dropped this year to an all-time low. Lockdowns and travel restrictions to control Covid outbreaks in China grew more widespread this year as the more contagious Omicron variant entered the country. A property market slump also dragged down the economy. However, more than a quarter \u2014 or 26% \u2014 of people with an annual household income above 345,000 yuan ($49,286), said they increased spending by 5% or more from last year, the survey found. Only 14% of that income group said they significantly cut their spending.\n\nThe more affluent group continues to spend, while lower-income groups are more hesitant and hold spending decisions McKinsey and Company\n\nThe trend reversed for those with far lower income, below 85,000 yuan a year. Just 12% said they increased spending, while 27% scaled back, the report said. \"The more affluent population is more confident about their personal wealth and future prospects,\" McKinsey told CNBC in a statement. \"They remain relatively more confident about keeping employed in the future and anticipating salary increases in the future. They also typically already have higher savings.\" \"So, the more affluent group continues to spend, while lower-income groups are more hesitant and hold spending decisions.\" Across all income categories, the majority \u2014 or about 60% \u2014 reported no change in spending this year. The share of the wealthiest that said they spent more was also ten percentage points smaller than the 36% reported in 2019.\n\nwatch now\n\nMcKinsey's survey of more than 6,700 Chinese consumers was conducted in July. In the months since, national data on retail sales has slumped as Covid controls tightened in major cities such as Beijing and Guangzhou. The share of urban households wanting to save \"for a rainy day\" rose to 58% \u2014 its highest since 2014, the McKinsey survey found. On top of reporting higher savings, more than half of the respondents still expected their household income to increase significantly over the next five years. However, the share ticked lower, to 54% this year from 59% in 2019.\n\nMore households grow wealthier\n\nLooking ahead, McKinsey expects the number of urban households in the lower income category to decline in the next three years, while millions more enter a more affluent group. The analysts noted a separate survey in August found that China respondents had far stronger expectations about a post-pandemic economic rebound than consumers in the U.S., U.K. or South Korea.\n\nOnly India and Indonesia had a larger share of optimistic consumers than China, the report said. \"Higher-income earners are reducing their purchase frequency, or changing their preferences in certain categories, rather than switching to cheaper brands or products,\" the analysts said. \"This is facilitated by brands, particularly domestic ones, upping their game and offering more widely differentiated products.\"\n\nWatching more videos", "label": "human"}
{"text": "On Tuesday, fitness celebrity Andrew Tate was arrested and charged with a number of crimes, including six counts of possession of child pornography. His arrest sparked online anger and inspired the spread of misinformation in the online community of Memes and Tate supporters. At one point, the label #FreeAndrewTate became popular on Twitter. The news of Tate's arrest caused a sensation online, sparking hundreds of thousands of tweets from angry public and celebrities. Among those who expressed their anger were actors Seth Logan, Tiffany Hardish and Demi Lovato, who issued statements condemning Tate and calling for justice for the victims. The news also immediately sparked myths and jokes about Tate, who gathered more than a million social media followers on YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. Many of the memoirs mention Tate's arrest and charges against him. However, in addition to the voices of anger and justice, there are a few who have come to defend Tate, claiming his innocence and declaring him a victim of \"witch hunting.\" Many Tate supporters consider the charges against him false, or at least exaggerated. While it's understandable that some people may be attracted to defending someone they like and support, it's important to remember that these types of crimes require a high burden of proof, and evidence must be presented to prove guilt. Therefore, those who currently claim his innocence do so without any substantial evidence and should not be taken seriously. In addition to Tate's supporters, some media outlets have begun to spread information about his arrest. A popular meme circulating on Twitter claims that Tate is accused of possessing child pornography only because he is a \"well-known person\", while other \"less-known people\" will not face similar charges, and several news outlets report that the charges are based on \"misleading information\". Tate's arrest is a very serious matter that requires swift justice and should be taken seriously by all parties. His alleged crimes are extremely serious, and he could face significant jail time if convicted. Tate and his supporters should keep this in mind and focus on the potential consequences of their actions rather than continuing to spread misinformation and memes. At the same time, it is important to acknowledge the impact of Tate's arrest on the public, and take into account that many of his fans - mostly young people - may not be fully aware of the implications of the charges against him. Many of them may not have sufficiently understood the details of the crime and its seriousness, which can cause some confusion and incomplete understanding of the situation. Therefore, it is important to ensure that any discussion of the case in question is civil and does not involve any malicious attacks or misinformation. It is also important to remember the victims of these crimes, and to ensure that their voices are heard and justice is done for them. The victims are those who have suffered most in this case, as well as those who have suffered the most from Tate's alleged crimes. This can be done by helping others understand the details of the case and not participating in any attempt to downplay or minimize the seriousness of the charges against Tate. It is essential that everyone take this case seriously, and oppose any attempts to spread misinformation or normalize this type of crime.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "OnePlus today fully revealed(Opens in a new window) its 2023 flagship smartphone, the OnePlus 11 5G, which goes on sale in its home market of China this month.\n\nA new set of headphones, the OnePlus Buds Pro 2, join the phone to make for a compelling, made-for-each other duo. OnePlus hopes the refined design and renewed partnership with famed camera maker Hasselblad will sway consumers away from phones made by competitors Apple, Google, and Samsung.\n\nReturn to Form\n\nWhen one pictures a black hole, the general idea that comes to mind is a vast swirl of bright gaseous material forming an accretion disc around a spherical black mass\u2014not a rectangular smartphone. Despite the obvious dissimilarity, OnePlus says its new \"black hole aesthetic\" is what sets the OnePlus 11 5G apart from its predecessor, the OnePlus 10 Pro 5G. Where the 10 had a squared-off camera module on the rear panel, the 11 features a circular camera module made of \"chromed-out\" stainless steel in order to stand apart from other smartphone designs.\n\n(Credit: OnePlus)\n\nBeyond the design, OnePlus is aiming high with a top-rated spec sheet. To start, the phone has a 6.7-inch LTPO 3.0 AMOLED 2K screen at 120Hz, which means it can rev the refresh rate up and down to conserve power while also offering a pleasing experience.\n\nThe phone is among the first to be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 Mobile Platform and it can be configured with up to 16GB of RAM and an unspecified amount of storage. The dual-cell battery measures 5,000mAh and supports 100W SuperVooc rapid charging. OnePlus didn't spell out just how quick the charging times will be. Last year's OnePlus 10 Pro supported 80W charging and powered up fully in about 30 minutes.\n\nOnePlus says its partnership with Hasselblad is back. The phone has a trio of rear cameras, including a 50MP main sensor, a 32MP portrait sensor, and a 48MP ultra-wide camera to cover the gamut of mobile photography. A 13-channel, multispectral sensor for light-color identification should provide improved color in photos. OnePlus didn't provide specifics on the selfie camera, nor the phone's video capture capabilities.\n\nThe phone ships with Android 13 and the latest version of OnePlus' OxygenOS user interface skin, but the phone maker shied away from detailing any features of the software, nor did it say anything about system updates and security support.\n\nNow Hear This\n\nThe OnePlus Buds Pro 2(Opens in a new window) join the 11 5G with a range of fresh features. OnePlus highlights the buds' customized spatial audio experience, which has a wide sound field and multi-dimensional sound. Even stereo sources can be rendered with a spatial effect via OnePlus' own stereo upmixing algorithm. Real-time head tracking is made possible by a high-precision, six-axis IMU sensor built into the buds to monitor head positioning. This allows the buds to recalibrate audio in real time to ensure the user is always placed in the center of the sound stage.\n\nInternally, the buds have MelodyBoost Dual Drivers for better frequency response. The 11mm drivers handle lower frequencies and the 6mm drivers handle mid and higher frequencies. OnePlus says the crystal polymer diaphragms improve overall balance and tone.\n\n(Credit: OnePlus)\n\nActive Noise Cancellation (ANC) is on board. The OnePlus Buds Pro 2 have smart ANC that can eliminate ambient noise up to 48dB, and can create personalized user profiles to provide the best possible noise reduction for each individual owner. The buds connect via Bluetooth 5.3 LE audio and deliver up to 39 hours of playback per charge, with additional charges available in the case.\n\nThe OnePlus 11 5G phone and OnePlus Buds Pro 2 earbuds will go on sale in China starting Jan. 3. OnePlus plans to detail global availability of both at an event planed for Feb. 7 in New Delhi, India.", "label": "human"}

{"text": ".. Hong Kong's stock market rose sharply on Monday, December 28, 2022 as CEO John Lee announced more Covid easing measures that would help stimulate the city's economic growth. On Monday, the Hang Seng index rose 2.7% to 33,743.85 points and climbed to 3.3% earlier in the day. The Hang Seng China Enterprise Index also jumped 2.7%, reaching 12,285.12 places. At a press conference on Monday, Mr Lee said the city was making progress in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic and that he was lifting certain restrictions on activities and commerce. These measures will lead to the closure of the city's main entertainment center in Causeway Bay and the removal of other restrictions, such as the reopening of night clubs, karaoke bars and Mahjong lounges. \"The third wave of the Covid-19 outbreak has been brought under control, and I believe that this epidemic will be brought under control in the near future. At the same time, we must take into account the needs of the public and issue some restrictions accordingly, starting today,\" Li said in a speech on Monday. The CEO also said his government would launch a relief fund to support businesses affected by the pandemic and would take additional measures to encourage people to shop and eat in local shops and restaurants. The announcement was welcomed by investors and analysts, who said relaxing restrictions would help boost sentiment among consumers and investors. \"The announcement is encouraging and will boost consumer confidence,\" said Francis Lun, CEO of GEO Securities, in an interview with CNBC. \"In addition, it will provide more support for the retail and tourism sectors that have been hit hard by the outbreak.\" The additional measures announced by Mr. Li came after the Hong Kong government announced in November a $400 billion stimulus plan aimed at revitalizing the city's economy. These measures have also been welcomed by the Hong Kong business community, which has been severely hit by the epidemic. \"The Chief Executive's announcement today is good news for Hong Kong businesses. We have been under a lot of pressure, which will help us to recover and get back on our feet,\" said Kitty Tse, executive director of the Hong Kong Retail Management Association. \"We hope that these measures will help increase consumer spending and stimulate economic activity in the city. It will also help restore investors' confidence in the city, which is essential for a healthy economy,\" she added. The measures announced by Lee Kuan Yew are expected to have a positive impact on Hong Kong's economy, which has been affected by the outbreak. Analysts expect these measures to help the city resume growth in 2021. \"These measures will help create much-needed economic activity in cities and will boost investor confidence. We expect the economy to return to growth in 2021, and these measures will help drive that growth,\" said Jackson Wong, an analyst at Tanrich Securities, in an interview with CNBC. The measures announced by Lee Kuan Yew were welcomed by investors who have pushed the Hang Seng Index higher in recent weeks. \"The relaxation of restrictions and the launch of the bailout fund is very encouraging and should help support the economy and stock markets in the long term,\" Kenny Yung, a core Pacific Hills international analyst, said in an interview with CNBC. The measures announced by Mr. Li are expected to help Hong Kong's economy achieve a strong recovery in the coming years. \"The measures announced by Mr. Lee are expected to have a positive impact on the economy and will be key to Hong Kong's strong recovery in the coming years,\" David Ng, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said in an interview with CNBC.", "label": "machine"}

He was 90.\n\nNASA confirmed Cunningham\u2019s death in a statement but did not include its cause. His family said through a spokesman, Jeff Carr, that Cunningham died in a hospital \u201cfrom complications of a fall, after a full and complete life.\u201d\n\nCunningham was one of three astronauts aboard the 1968 Apollo 7 mission, an 11-day spaceflight that beamed live television broadcasts as they orbited Earth, paving the way for the moon landing less than a year later.\n\nCunningham, then a civilian, crewed the mission with Navy Capt. Walter M. Schirra and Donn F. Eisele, an Air Force major. Cunningham was the lunar module pilot on the space flight, which launched from Cape Kennedy Air Force Station, Florida, on Oct. 11 and splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean south of Bermuda.\n\nNASA said Cunningham, Eisele and Schirra\u2019 flew a near perfect mission. Their spacecraft performed so well that the agency sent the next crew, Apollo 8, to orbit the moon as a prelude to the Apollo 11 moon landing in July 1969.\n\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Tuesday that Cunningham was \u201cabove all\u201d an explorer whose work also laid the foundation for the agency\u2019s new Artemis moon program.\n\nThe Apollo 7 astronauts also won a special Emmy award for their daily television reports from orbit, during which they clowned around, held up humorous signs and educated earthlings about space flight.\n\nIt was NASA\u2019s first crewed space mission since the deaths of the three Apollo 1 astronauts in a launch pad fire Jan. 27, 1967.\n\nCunningham recalled Apollo 7 during a 2017 event at the Kennedy Space Center, saying it \u201cenabled us to overcome all the obstacles we had after the Apollo 1 fire and it became the longest, most successful test flight of any flying machine ever.\u201d\n\nCunningham was born in Creston, Iowa, and attended high school in California before enlisting with the Navy in 1951 and serving as a Marine Corps. pilot in Korea, according to NASA. He later obtained bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in physics from the University of California at Los Angeles, where he also did doctoral studies, and worked as scientist for the Rand Corporation before joining NASA.\n\nIn an interview the year before his death, Cunningham recalled growing up poor and dreaming of flying airplanes, not spacecraft.\n\n\u201cWe never even knew that there were astronauts when I was growing up,\u201d Cunningham told The Spokesman-Review.\n\nAfter retiring from NASA in 1971, Cunningham worked in engineering, business and investing, and became a public speaker and radio host. He wrote a memoir about his career and time as an astronaut, \u201cThe All-American Boys.\u201d He also expressed skepticism in his later years about human activity contributing to climate change, bucking the scientific consensus in writing and public talks, while acknowledging that he was not a climate scientist.\n\nAlthough Cunningham never crewed another space mission after Apollo 7, he remained a proponent of space exploration. He told the Spokane, Washington, paper last year, \u201cI think that humans need to continue expanding and pushing out the levels at which they\u2019re surviving in space.\u201d\n\nCunningham is survived by his wife Dot, his sister Cathy Cunningham, and his children Brian and Kimberly.

The news of Hamlin's health panic caused a sensation in the sports world, as both athletes and fans sent messages of support and prayer on social media. Steelers players such as quarterback Ben Roethlisberger and center Maurkis Pouncey were among the first to show support, posting tweets of their concern and good intentions. In a statement, Steelers said: \"At this moment, our thoughts and prayers are with Damar and his family. The Brown organization also issued a statement saying: \"Our thoughts are with Damar and his family, and we hope he recovers quickly.\" The National Football League (NFL) said in a statement that they are \"deeply saddened to learn of the medical incident involving Damar Hamlin. We wish him a full and speedy recovery, and our thoughts and prayers go out to him and his family.\" Many other prominent sports personalities also expressed their support on Twitter, including UFC chairman Dana White, who tweeted \"pray for Damar Hamlin and his family\".

{"text": "\"? Over the past few years, restaurant chains have been investing heavily in robotics and automation technologies. From big brands like McDonald's to smaller chains like Wendy's, they are investing in these technologies to accelerate production, improve efficiency, reduce costs, and maintain consistent quality. The shift to robotics and automation is most evident in the fast food industry, where robots are used to help prepare food. Restaurants have also begun trying to automatically order and pay, robot kitchen assistants, and even robot servers. But what does this mean for workers? Restaurants are now replacing these workers with robots, completely eliminating the need for labor. This can reduce labor costs and increase efficiency, allowing restaurant owners to focus on growing their business without relying on expensive labor. At the same time, robots can improve the quality of food services because they are able to prepare meals accurately and consistently for a fraction of human workers' time. This can increase customer satisfaction and reduce food waste. Moreover, robots can work around the clock with minimal maintenance, which means restaurants don't have to worry about labor supply or costs associated with hiring and training new employees. Despite these potential benefits, the impact of robots and automation on workers is still worrying. Automation has the potential to cause unemployment and displacement, which could have a significant economic impact on the restaurant industry. Automation can increase inequality among workers, because some people are better equipped to adapt to these new technologies than others. Robots could also lead to increased repetitive work and an overall decline in creativity and innovation. The restaurant industry must be aware of the potential consequences of adopting robotics and automation technologies, and ensure that any changes are made in a way that is fair to workers. This includes providing training and retraining opportunities for those affected by automation, as well as considering other measures such as minimum wages and benefits. Overall, robotics and automation in the restaurant industry offer some potential benefits that can improve efficiency and quality while reducing costs and waste. However, these benefits must be balanced against the potential negative impact on workers.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Four months have passed since the launch of XBB.1.5, a new artificial intelligence-driven search engine that promises to make it easier for people to find the information they need. Since then, this new tool has become increasingly popular, with some tech commentators claiming it is revolutionizing the way people search for information. Some have raised questions about what it means to let AI-powered search engines determine what information people can access. How will this change the way we consume and create content? Are we sacrificing privacy and autonomy in exchange for having all the information we need conveniently? The short answer is that no one really knows. It's too early to say what the long-term effects of using XBB.1.5 will be. But experts say there are certain things we should definitely be aware of when using new search engines. When XBB.1.5 collects user data, it can be used to create personalized feeds for use by marketers or politicians. This could lead to the creation of \"filter bubbles\" or \"echo chambers,\" which reinforce existing biases rather than introduce new ideas to us. In addition, there are concerns that XBB.1.5 may lead to a review of certain topics because it is designed to show only what it considers \"appropriate\" information. This could lead to a narrower perspective and less diversity in the content available on the Internet. Since XBB.1.5 is an AI-powered search engine, it may require users to provide them with large amounts of personal data, such as the type of content they search for and the websites they visit. This data can be collected, shared, and used for a variety of purposes without the user's knowledge or consent. Of course, many of these problems also exist in other search engines, and XBB.1.5 is not the only problem with these potential traps. But in fact, it's an artificial intelligence-driven tool, which means that these problems may be more obvious in XBB.1.5 than in other search engines. For example, AI-powered search engines can quickly collect and process large amounts of data, enabling them to provide more accurate search results than human-driven search engines. It could also open up new opportunities for e-commerce, as AI-powered search engines help online retailers better target their audiences and advertise. It is everyone's responsibility to decide whether the advantages of using a new search engine outweigh any potential risks or concerns. But it would be wise to act cautiously until we better understand the long-term implications of using XBB.1.5.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".. When the tech world explodes due to layoffs in 2020, the industry's future seems uncertain. Hundreds of thousands of skilled workers suddenly lose their jobs, and open software engineering positions are few and far between. As technology professionals reassess their career prospects, a trend begins to emerge - many are accepting roles that offer greater job security and longer lives. For some, this means moving out of the tech world and working in other industries. As a result, software engineers and other technical professionals are employed in a range of non-technical positions. For example, software engineers may work for law firms, accountants, or business analysts. After seeing that layoffs hurt the job market, many tech workers have become more cautious and take less risk when making career decisions. Many are no longer choosing to enter the latest busy start-ups or work for companies with stock fluctuations, but instead choose positions at established firms that offer greater stability. There is a new understanding of job safety and stability for tech professionals who have been burned by layoffs. The technology industry may not be as resilient to economic downturns as it used to be, but many professionals are still determined to create a successful career for themselves - which often means playing roles outside the realm of traditional technology. At the same time, many tech professionals are becoming more self-aware, spending time evaluating their skills and taking computational risks to get a better role. This shift in risk aversion can also be seen in how many professionals choose projects for research. The job market is more competitive than ever, but many people remain committed to building successful and secure careers - which often means accepting roles outside the traditional tech industry. By taking the time to assess their skills and risk computing, technology professionals can find jobs that provide stability and security - something many lack after 2020's layoffs.", "label": "machine"}

My father recently retired after a long career in banking, and although he was doing well at the time, he now lives on a fixed income that is barely enough to meet his basic needs. Over the past few years, I've been supplementing his retirement fund - groceries, monthly bills and occasional overeating. My own financial situation has been difficult for the past few years. I found a new job at a lower salary, and my savings decreased when I helped my father. Now I can't continue to do this, there are things that have to change. I had a serious discussion with my father about his finances, and he was aware of my situation. We both understood that I couldn't continue to support him as before, and he accepted it too, but this is still a difficult topic. My family has always been very close, and I worry about how they will respond to the news. While I know it's going to be a tough conversation, I believe the best way is to be honest and open with them. The first step is to talk to my father and make sure he knows that I can no longer provide him with financial assistance. I will explain to him why my situation has changed, and make it clear that I did so out of love, not out of selfishness or lack of care. The next step is to tell the family. I'm not sure how this conversation will go, but it certainly will be difficult. I know that some of my family members will understand why I made this difficult decision, while others may not. I plan to have an open and honest discussion that explains my situation as clearly as possible. I also want to explain to them that although my father may need to change his lifestyle, I am not asking them to step in and fill the financial gap. My best advice is patience and understanding. This conversation will be difficult, but ultimately it will be better for everyone. While this decision may not be easy to make, I believe that in the long run it will be best for my family and myself.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": ".. In the era of TikTok and Instagram, it has become commonplace for people to record their lives on social media. From cute, interesting moments to intense beauty, people are increasingly relying on capturing their daily lives so that the world can see them. A growing number of people are being diagnosed with a condition known as \"transformational mirror gaze\" (DMG), which is defined as excessive attention to their image in the mirror. It is understood that DMG patients spend several hours each day carefully examining their appearance and become so obsessed with their reflections that they forget to eat, sleep or anything else. The disease is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic, environmental and psychological factors, such as physical deformities, depression or obsessive disorder. But regardless of the cause, its effects are severe.DMG patients are often isolated from friends and family, and persistent stress and anxiety due to obsession can seriously damage their physical and mental health. Cognitive behavioral therapy has proven to be an effective treatment for this disease, as it can help patients learn to recognize and manage anxious thoughts and behaviors. In addition, patients can learn healthy coping mechanisms to deal with their forced thoughts and feelings and stop fixing their appearance. At the same time, those with DMG need to be aware of the real risks associated with prolonged and excessive mirror staring. Research shows that individuals who are often exposed to their own image may have unrealistic expectations about their bodies, leading to self-conscious distortions. In addition, people with DMG need to seek help from a mental health professional because this condition can have serious negative effects on their lives. It is important that individuals do not ignore the symptoms of DMG, as it often gets out of control and becomes a major obstacle in their lives. By talking to a therapist, patients can begin to take back control of their own lives and take the first steps toward recovery. Although DMG is a relatively new disease, it is rapidly gaining acceptance and helping more than ever for those with the condition. With the right treatment, people with DMG can learn how to manage their obsession with their image and regain control over their lives.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "You don't need to know about people's disabilities to make your meetings more accessible to everyone. An estimated one in four adults in the US lives with a disability(Opens in a new window), according to the CDC, and many of those disabilities are invisible. Plus, people have temporary or situational disabilities. Being in a noisy environment can situationally affect a person's hearing, for example, so that they need closed captioning to follow along in a meeting.\n\nAdditionally, you'll have more inclusive and more productive meetings if you increase people's comfort level and ability to participate, even if they don't have a disability. There are simple ways to make meetings more comfortable for introverts, people who don't speak English as a first language, and others.\n\nWhile having the right video conference software and technology goes a long way to making meetings more accessible, they're hardly the only things you need to consider. Your organizational culture plays a role. So does the way in which hosts and participants speak, act, and interact. With that in mind, here's some guidance for making meetings more accessible. I focus more on virtual meetings than in-person ones because they are by their very nature more accessible and more easily made accessible, as you'll see.\n\n1. Create a Culture of Speaking Up\n\nThe most important step you and your organization can do to make meetings more accessible is to create a culture where people feel comfortable speaking up. No matter how hard you try to make meetings inclusive and accessible, it's impossible to please everyone all the time. But if your meetings are safe spaces where people can ask for what they need when they need it, you'll be in an ideal position to make adjustments and provide access to people as needed. If a participant feels comfortable saying or typing into the chat, \"I can't see your screen-share clearly. Can you zoom in please?\" or \"Your ceiling fan in the video is causing me problems. Would you please change your camera angle or blur your background?\" then everyone is in a better position to succeed.\n\n2. Provide an Agenda and Materials in Advance\n\nEvery meeting needs to have a clear agenda. For recurring meetings, the agenda may be baked into the name of the meeting (weekly check-in, for example) but really, it helps everyone if they know in advance what the meeting is going to cover. Adding an agenda makes everything clear, and it helps participants know what they need to do to prepare. If someone with a disability thinks they are going to be a passive attendee in a meeting and then they're called on the spot to participate, they may not be adequately set up to do so.\n\nSimilarly, provide attendees a copy of any materials, such as presentations, before meetings\u2014or at least hand them out right at the start. When you give people a copy of your presentation, they can use screen readers on them, zoom in as needed, follow along at their own pace, make notes on a local copy, and not lose their place or get distracted if a technological glitch interrupts the real-time presentation.\n\n3. Add Alt Text to Images in Presentations\n\nBefore you circulate meeting materials (which you'll do before the meeting now), make sure to add alt text for all important images. Alt text allows people who can't see the image, whether because of disability or technical problems, to get a brief description of what they're missing. For example, if you include a financial chart, the alt text should briefly summarize what you're trying to highlight, such as \"Chart showing 50% growth from January to June 2022.\"\n\n(Credit: PCMag)\n\nIn some meeting software, you may not be able to add alt text to some images, like those shared via chat. In those cases the presenter can give a brief verbal description if the image is important to the meeting, or someone can type into the chat a short description: \"Alt text: a room on fire and a dog sitting in a chair saying, 'This is fine.'\"\n\n4. Make Some of the Meeting Asynchronous\n\nSending your slides or meeting materials before a meeting is one way to make part of the meeting asynchronous (meaning people are not interacting in real time). When meetings have an asynchronous component, you waste significantly less time in meetings and give people an opportunity to process information, think, and brainstorm before discussing it live. People who are introverted, don't have a firm command of the meeting language, have speech impediments, and many others find it incredibly helpful to come to meetings having already done some of the work that the meeting seeks to accomplish.\n\n5. Record the Call\n\nFor important meetings, large meetings, and webinars, record the call and make the video available to people afterward. Having a video means your meeting is now accessible to anyone who couldn't attend. It also lets people rewatch important parts of the meeting, take better notes, and clarify anything they didn't understand the first time. People watching the video can also slow down or speed up the playback, turn on closed captioning (many video conferencing tools include them\u2014more on that in a moment), and sometimes even download a transcript of the audio.\n\n6. Enable Closed Captioning\n\nThe biggest players in video conferencing\u2014including Zoom Meetings, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams\u2014all have an option to enable automated, machine-generated closed captioning during a meeting. In Microsoft Teams, it's called Live Captions(Opens in a new window), and it includes a setting for participants to have their captions translated into one of 34 languages (counting several dialects of English among them). Live Captions is part of Windows's accessibility-first approach. Google Meet can likewise transcribe a variety of languages and translate between them.\n\n(Credit: PCMag)\n\nAuto-generated captions always fall short, however, so Teams now has an option for you to invite a professional stenographer to transcribe meetings in real time and have the more accurate closed captioning appear to participants\u2014it's called CART captions(Opens in a new window), and you have to provide your own stenographer.\n\n7. Make Accessibility Features Opt-Out, Not Opt-In\n\nA crucial step that many people overlook when running virtual meetings is getting to know the software they use. (It was a prime reason so many Zoom bombings happened early in the COVID-19 pandemic; few people knew what options they had to make meetings secure. Zoom was culpable, too and should have made security features more prominent.) As you explore your software and learn what accessibility features exist, see which ones you can enable permanently so that they're on by default. This way, accessibility features become opt-out for people in meetings, not opt-in.\n\n8. Brush Up on Best Practices for Slideshows\n\nBefore presenting materials in a virtual meeting, review best practices for creating and presenting slideshows(Opens in a new window) because they improve accessibility, too. For example, one best practice for slideshows is to set the type much bigger than you might expect: 40pt for in-person meetings and at least 24pt for virtual meetings. Making the font that big forces you to keep the text on the page to a minimum, which is another best practice. Don't clutter your slides. Always show the full written name of important products, places, and people (including their titles) that you reference. Not everyone knows who Gary is, and some people might hear \"Cary.\" Write it down.\n\nIf you use Microsoft Teams, look into using the feature PowerPoint Live, which allows participants to activate a screen reader on PowerPoint presentations; screen readers don't work on presentations shown via screen sharing. You should still make a copy of the presentation available to meeting participants either before the meeting or at the very start of it, but using PowerPoint Live is helpful if someone didn't receive it.\n\n9. Presenters: Enable Video and Center Your Face\n\nIf you are presenting during a meeting, enable your video and center your face. Make sure your face is taking up the majority of the screen. That way, people can see your lips as you talk and read your facial expressions, both of which can help people understand what you're saying. The exception is if you're using sign language while presenting, in which case back away from the camera enough to show yourself from at least the torso up.\n\n(Credit: Getty Images)\n\nPresenters should have their video cameras on while speaking. As to whether other participants should enable their cameras, I believe it's a personal choice. Presenters and meeting hosts typically find it useful to see the audience's faces during a meeting because it gives them feedback\u2014not only if the meeting is engaging and people are understanding the material, but also if something goes awry. If a presenter's microphone suddenly cuts out, for example, the muted participants may cup a hand around their ear or wave to indicate there's a problem.\n\n10. Speak Clearly, Slow Down, and Repeat Important Information\n\nSpeak clearly and remind yourself to slow down from time to time during meetings. People will be able to hear you better and closed captioning will be more accurate. Also, repeat important information in case people missed it the first time. This advice is applicable in any kind of business situation, and it's especially relevant in virtual meetings where technology hiccups and other issues can impede the flow of conversation.\n\n11. Use Headphones and a Mic\n\nUsing a headset and microphone is a standard tip for improving video calls, but it also matters for accessibility. The headphones eliminate any chance of feedback, and the microphone makes it easier to hear your voice. A microphone built into a headset is fine, and even an inexpensive set of headphones with an inline mic is better than nothing. Bluetooth devices are usually fine, but when they get old and start to degrade, they may create static or garbled sounds for other meeting participants, so be sure to occasionally ask for a thumbs-up if everyone can hear you clearly.\n\n12. Blur or Neutralize Your Background\n\n(Credit: PCMag)\n\nA cluttered and chaotic background can make it difficult for people to focus. When you're speaking, make sure you either have an uncluttered and neutral space behind you, or enable a filter that blurs or blocks out your background. All major video conferencing software has this setting.\n\n13. Passive Participants: Mute Yourself\n\nNot muting your microphone when you are a passive participant in a meeting is slightly unprofessional but also bad for accessibility. Accidental noises coming from your end can interrupt other people's hearing and compromise the quality of any closed captioning being used.\n\n14. Put Your Full Name and Pronouns in Your Profile\n\nMost meeting software lets you add your name to your profile so that meeting participants can know who you are. Make sure you fill it out with your full name as you are known by your colleagues and your pronouns. Zoom Meeting has a separate field for adding pronouns. Your name helps other people identify you and including your pronouns helps them refer to you correctly. Clarifying pronouns also normalizes doing it, which can help other people feel comfortable sharing their pronouns and create a more inclusive environment.\n\nSimilarly, when you speak in a large meeting or in a meeting where not everyone knows you, state your full name clearly and slowly so people can hear it and know how to pronounce it.\n\n15. Schedule Breaks for Long Meetings\n\nWhenever a meeting is scheduled to run longer than 45 minutes or so, schedule breaks. Everyone will appreciate them, but it's especially important for people who are or were recently pregnant, have chronic pain, or are in a situation where sitting still for long periods of time is difficult and therefore distracting.\n\nFor more advice on meetings and remote work, see our 20 tips for working from home and 5 tips for more productive meetings.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Washington's Republicans announced today that, after months of negotiations, they have finally reached a plan to save the legacy of former President Donald Trump. The deal is mediated by conservative and center-party Republican lawmakers, including an extensive effort to save the political career of one of Trump's Chief of Staff, Michael McCarthy. McCarthy served as Trump's top adviser until his controversial departure in 2020, but the Republican Party has largely been turned away since leaving the White House. But as McCarthy's star fades, so does its record on governance, with its weak majority in both the House and Senate struggling to pass major legislation. To reverse these trends and restore some kind of bipartisan image in Washington, the GOP coalition today announced a wide range of policy measures aimed at rebuilding McCarthy's political influence - and ensuring that the GOP is more than just a \"no\" party. At the heart of the plan is the party's commitment to implement a comprehensive immigration reform bill, which McCarthy's long-term goal. The legislation will include ways for \"dreamers\" to gain citizenship - undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children - as well as greater border security measures and simplified visa regimes. The proposal also calls for expanding legal protections for LGBTQ Americans, increasing funding for opioid addiction treatment, and funding research on innovative new healthcare solutions such as telemedicine. It also promises to pass much needed infrastructure funding, an area that Republicans have largely missed at the national level in recent years. The party's commitment to working with Democrats on these issues, in addition to the proposal's strong focus on economic opportunity, is seen as a direct attempt to restore McCarthy's position within the party. \"Michael McCarthy has been an active advocate of ensuring that our parties don't just talk about issues but take action to get things done,\" said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA). \"This plan is the way we express it, and we recognize and appreciate his important contributions and are committed to doing what is necessary to build a strong, prosperous and secure America.\" While the proposal is widely seen as a sign of the party's willingness to work together and compromise, some key Republicans have voiced concerns that these measures could leave them without support from Trump's loyal voters. \"There are some who worry that the party's new direction may alienate Trump's base,\" said Rep. Jim Jordan, a ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, \"but I think the reality is we have to accept that our ex-president has passed away and we have to move on to make sure our party succeeds in the long run.\" Still, even if Jordan ultimately supported the plan, he said he believed the party's commitment to true governance and a bipartisan system would eventually win. \"It's not about ideology or party, it's about doing the right thing for the country,\" he said. \"It's an opportunity for us to show that we are serious about governance and seriously about delivering results. I hope colleagues on both sides of the Strait join our efforts.\" As the party moves into the 2024 election season, it seems that the Republican Party will finally put aside its ideological differences to save its former leader - and in the process itself - from political status. Time will tell if this strategy succeeds, but for now, Republicans seem to agree that a fresh start is exactly what their party needs.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": ".. When it comes to business and problem solving, sometimes your team finds itself in a situation where they can't find solutions. This is especially true when problems require creative thinking or ask the team to look at things from a different perspective. In this case, it may be beneficial to get the team out of the box to come up with a successful solution. Here are three tips for when your team needs to think outside the box. Let the team have a brainstorm. In a brainstorm, the team should first write down a list of potential solutions without any judgment or criticism. No matter how bizarre or stupid these ideas may sound, they should be encouraged. 2. Encouraging critical thinking Another way to get a team out of the mind is to encourage critical thinking. Critical thinking allows your team to analyze problems from multiple perspectives, which helps them see things from different perspectives, leading to more creative solutions. Encouraging teams to come up with exploratory questions and challenge assumptions, while teaching them how to evaluate available data, will allow the team to make informed decisions and propose effective solutions. 3. Setting aside dedicated time for creativity When your team is in trouble, giving them time to solve problems uninterruptedly allows the team to really focus on the task at hand without any interference. During this time, the team can brainstorm, experiment, explore different ideas and solutions that can help them come up with something creative and innovative, while also teaching them how to work together and think critically. When your team needs to think outside, these three tips can help them find a successful solution. Brainstorming, critical thinking, and dedicated time for creativity are great tools that allow your team to think in novel and exciting ways. These techniques help break down psychological barriers and encourage collaboration, ultimately enabling your team to find creative and effective solutions.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The fall of former Illinois lawmaker and longtime House Speaker Michael Madigan opens up a new career for one of his former senior aides: selling weeds in Michigan. Rodney Wilson, who served as Madigan's chief of staff for eight years before the speaker was ousted in 2020, is now the owner and operator of The Good Herb, a cannabis pharmacy located in Lansing, Michigan. Wilson played a major role in the passage of Illinois' 2019 recreational marijuana bill, opening The Good Herb to steady customers who were eager to try his product last weekend. \"We are delighted to finally be able to provide our customers with the best recreational marijuana,\" Wilson said in a statement. \"We have spent several months sourcing only the highest quality flowers and essential oils to choose from, and we believe that our products are of excellent quality. We are also very proud to offer outstanding service to our customers and ensure that their experience at The Good Herb is both enjoyable and educational.\" Good Herb offers a variety of products, including flowers, ingredients, flavorings and oils, from local licensed growers in Michigan.The pharmacy also provides educational seminars on the science behind cannabis, proper storage and use, and its benefits to medical patients. Wilson's adventure with the cannabis industry was far removed from his days as Madigan's senior aide. During Madigan's reign, he took root in national politics, helping the former speaker legislate and shape the nation's agenda. However, Madigan's fall in 2020 was rapid and dramatic. Nearly half a century after serving as the longest sitting House Speaker in U.S. history, he was removed from office by his own party on suspicion of involvement in a series of scandals over bribe-support schemes. After his expulsion, Madigan's former senior aide chose a different path, one that would take him to the Great Lakes state and the emerging cannabis industry. \"I'm passionate about marijuana and its potential to improve people's lives,\" Wilson said, \"and I'm excited to be part of Michigan's growing industry and help others access the therapeutic benefits of cannabis.\" Michigan was a pioneer in the cannabis industry, becoming the first state east of Mississippi to legalise recreational use of marijuana in 2018. Since then, the industry has exploded in the state, creating thousands of jobs and generating millions of dollars in tax revenue. Wilson's decision to move to Michigan and open a pharmacy was praised by many in the industry, including state attorney general Dana Nessel. \"Rodney's experience and knowledge will be a major asset to the Michigan cannabis industry,\" Nessel said in a statement, adding: \"I am delighted to have him as part of our team and look forward to seeing the development of The Good Herb and its many benefits for the people of Michigan.\" For Wilson, the move is an opportunity to restart and become part of a growing industry. \"I'm looking forward to helping people discover the amazing benefits of cannabis,\" he said. \"This is an exciting time for this industry, and I am eager to see what the future holds.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Laura: Right.\n\nAlex: Now you tell us.\n\nGil: My prediction is that she will be Chesa Boudin, and she\u2019ll realize that this is the situation you have. Because, I mean, I\u2019ve been on campaigns\u2014you promise all this stuff, then you get in the office, like, holy crap, there are all these problems, obstacles, rules, things you can do, things you can\u2019t do, so it\u2019s not as easy as giving a speech. I think the legacy of it will be that the D.A. will get a lot more scrutiny going forward. But I also think some interesting things have turned up in the polls that have been conducted here over the past few months, which is that people are conflating homelessness and disorder and mental illness on the streets with crime. The fact that we are statistically much safer from violent crime than we\u2019ve ever been in recent history doesn\u2019t matter as much. I think the real problem that Democrats in California are responsible for and have to face is, why do so many people live on our streets? To me, that\u2019s not a problem you solve with jails, though that is what some people are proposing. It\u2019s a problem you have to solve with housing and with care and with empathy. When you do the research here and you look at what people like Brooke Jenkins are proposing, it\u2019s really infuriating because it\u2019s all the broken stuff that doesn\u2019t work. Most voters fell for this line, and I think they\u2019re gonna be sorely disappointed. Then the question is gonna be what do we really do, and, again, there\u2019s no path forward that doesn\u2019t lead you back to the very reforms that got Chesa Boudin crucified in San Francisco. By the way, he didn\u2019t even do those reforms. That was Jerry Brown. That was Gavin Newsom. People act like Boudin did those reforms. I was a part of those reforms. I had more to do with them than Boudin did. He was in Venezuela or somewhere. And the voters voted for these things. We supported these things. So what was scary to me is how you could really channel that kind of public anger at somebody who had nothing to do with it. But again, he wasn\u2019t a great politician. He was too honest. Another legacy of Chesa Boudin\u2019s recall: Don\u2019t be too honest. Kind of lie. It\u2019s working for Jenkins. She\u2019s lying her way to victory today.\n\nAlex: All right. Well, great advice. If you\u2019re listening, that\u2019s great advice for any politicians listening at home.\n\nGil: They already know.\n\nAlex: Gil, thank you so much for that edifying conversation.\n\nGil: Thank you.\n\nLaura: After the break, we\u2019ll look into who was behind Boudin\u2019s recall. The backers of the recall campaign wanted him out. But they may have had a bigger political project too.\n\nLaura: We\u2019ve been talking about the way crime in San Francisco appeared in the media and how those stories played with voters and with other Democrats. But this is also a story about a few individuals who invested heavily in removing Boudin from his position. The recall campaign raised $7 million, more than double the amount Boudin\u2019s supporters raised. One of Boudin\u2019s earliest and most vocal opponents was the Silicon Valley investor David O. Sacks. He called Boudin \u201cthe killer D.A.\u201d and told The Megyn Kelly Show he thought Boudin was to blame for \u201cchaos and lawlessness\u201d in San Francisco. At one point in the campaign, nearly one-third of all donations against Boudin came from him. We\u2019re talking now with Jacob Silverman about David O. Sacks\u2019s involvement in the recall and his larger political agenda. Jacob, thanks for joining us.\n\nJacob Silverman: Thanks for having me. Glad to be here.\n\nLaura: David O. Sacks is a fascinating figure. He\u2019s connected to a lot of other powerful figures in Silicon Valley who are also increasingly politically active. Can you tell us a bit about him?\n\nJacob: Sure. Right now I suppose you\u2019d call him a member of the PayPal Mafia, as it\u2019s pretty widely known.\n\nLaura: OK, and just remind us: What is the PayPal Mafia?\n\nJacob: It\u2019s basically the core early employees of PayPal\u2014who were all men\u2014and the most well known of whom are Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and, as I argue, David Sacks. And you\u2019ve got companies like YouTube and many others that came out of there and the whole Musk and Thiel empires. They\u2019ve all gone on mostly to huge amounts of wealth and a lot of influence in the Valley. But Sacks\u2019s association with these folks goes back to Stanford in the early \u201990s, where he met Peter Thiel, Keith Rabois, and some other folks who would be early PayPal employees at Stanford. A lot of them wrote for or worked on the Stanford Review, which was the conservative publication that Thiel founded. Basically it was an era where they were doing a lot of the same culture warring that we see today, but at the time, what they were worried about was issues of multiculturalism\u2014that was the big bogeyman, that word specifically\u2014and diversity in general. If you look at their writings then and the battles they\u2019re having then compared to now, it\u2019s a lot of the same issues, with a lot of the same crude talking points.\n\nLaura: Right. The way I knew of Sacks from that period was that he was actually the co-author of a book with Peter Thiel called The Diversity Myth. And just for our listeners, they weren\u2019t advocating for diversity. This wasn\u2019t like a group of people who were drawing attention to like, \u201cOh, there\u2019s like rape on campus. This is something we should do something about.\u201d They were the backlash to people who were making those arguments.\n\nJacob: Very much so. They were part of this conservative counterreaction or backlash at Stanford that was, in part, people were sick of hearing about the \u201960s from their professors. It was early \u201990s, Clinton era. It was just its turn, I suppose, for conservative counterrevolution, and they were doing things like testing the bounds of free speech by yelling at people with bigoted slurs and stuff like that. There was an issue of the Stanford Review called \u201cThe Rape Issue.\u201d But in general there was this disgust with what they saw around them which was lots of efforts at diversity inclusion. There would be ethnic affinity halls on campus, a lot of cultural-based campus organizations, things like that. They thought everything was being divided among racial lines and it was sort of like, \u201cOh, the anti-racists have become the real racists\u201d thing that you hear now.\n\nLaura: It\u2019s funny because the way that we mostly know of these figures now is that they are investors, CEOs. Thiel founded several successful companies, but most notably PayPal. David O. Sacks was the CEO of Zenefits, which kind of blew up in a crazy way a few years ago. They\u2019re known as business figures, but really they were activists from the beginning, and they continue to be politically active. There\u2019s kind of a straight line between those campus cultural war days and what David Sacks has been doing in San Francisco.\n\nJacob: When some of the comments, especially about rape in The Diversity Myth appeared, they disavowed them. They said, \u201cOh, those are just impetuous thoughts of my youth.\u201d But look, we could argue about whether they still believe these things, but they were political animals from the beginning and they were very preternaturally aware of how to operate within political milieus. And so Sacks and Thiel were co-writers from an early age in college. They wrote pieces for Wall Street Journal and National Review and other political publications. Their book was sponsored by the Independent Institute, which was a libertarian think tank. They were well connected from the beginning, and so I\u2019d say that the business has been pretty good for both of them. And of course PayPal was the core of that. But the politics have always been there. I think what you see more in recent years is that the ideology probably has been pretty consistent, but in terms of inserting himself more into the public sphere and having a more perhaps coherent though still murky, I\u2019d say, political program, and being willing to donate money and be loud about it\u2014that\u2019s where Sacks is at now and where things have changed. Thiel is a little bit of a quieter figure, but he\u2019s certainly been a force for years politically.\n\nAlex: On the one hand, anytime you look into the history of reaction and the history of the right in this country, it\u2019s dispiriting how reliably it can be traced back to the hangups of college Republicans on elite college campuses. We just can\u2019t get away from that.\n\nJacob: It\u2019s crazy. From Buckley to Thiel.\n\nAlex: It\u2019s just a story that repeats itself over and over again. But from what you\u2019re describing, it seems like there was this little bit of these guys making their money and then now in this political environment, for a variety of reasons, deciding to let the mask slip, and after being apolitical for a while, reverting back to the reactionary politics they were forged in and being much more open about pursuing them.\n\nJacob: Yeah. I think you certainly saw that earlier with Thiel and his support of Trump and his writings basically against democracy and women\u2019s suffrage. Someone like Sacks donated to Hilary Clinton and some mainstream Democrats, but what basically has happened in the last few years, is that they\u2019ve given up on, I\u2019d argue, democratic governance, probably with a big D and small d. And San Francisco is the core of that\u2014 the emblem of everything that\u2019s failed in urban governments in America. They don\u2019t necessarily have a positive economic or policy program, but they are willing to spend a lot of money on recalls and on reactionary figures. So that\u2019s what brings us to today is that people like Sacks and him in particular: Every major recall that\u2019s happened either in the Bay Area or recall attempt, or statewide, he\u2019s put money into all of those.\n\nAlex: How much money are we talking for Sacks in this one recall for Boudin?\n\nJacob: It\u2019s mid-to-high five figures. There are other people like William Oberndorf, who is a billionaire, who put in more. But I would argue two things. One, you don\u2019t know, as actually Boudin himself said in an interview, you don\u2019t always know where the money is going with some of these organizations. Sacks certainly was very influential in terms of the sheer dollar-to-dollar but also the role he played of bringing tech people into this and being a propagandizer against Boudin.\n\nLaura: Why do you think he focused on Boudin so much? I mean, he wrote this piece calling him \u201cthe killer D.A.\u201d on Medium. Why Boudin? Why pick that fight?\n\nJacob: I think he cares about San Francisco because he lives there and one of his at least three mansions is there. He\u2019s been there a long time. And I think also he is just rather draconian law and order, seemingly, in his politics, and he doesn\u2019t like what he sees from the criminal justice reform movement. I\u2019ve seen interviews where he\u2019s barely paid lip service to it, like, \u201cOh, maybe people shouldn\u2019t be arrested for smoking weed,\u201d or something like that. But he is part of this trend, I\u2019d say, both legally and culturally, to criminalize homelessness and to see homelessness as synonymous with crime, even though a lot of homeless people are crime victims. So Boudin was a ripe target. They had some success with the school board recall, which he put money into. The Newsom recall did not work, but he put money into that too. He\u2019s willing to take his swings, and I think Boudin was a good target with this alliance of billionaire developers and tech people who were disgusted with what they saw. In his own telling, he thinks that Boudin was basically more sympathetic to criminals than to crime victims. He\u2019s pretty unequivocal about that.\n\nAlex: Something I find interesting about this political moment\u2014because I have this feeling that they are meddling in San Francisco because they think of it as their fiefdom to an extent and they should be able to control what\u2019s going on there\u2014but these are the sorts of people, people with these backgrounds, who for much of my adult life we would have described as being libertarian. They would have been promoting anti-government, John Galt-y, Randian libertarianism\u2014that was the flavor of Silicon Valley giving for so many years. But it seems like the new style is pretty straight up law-and-order authoritarianism. I would say that seems like a shift, but I don\u2019t know how much of a shift it actually turned out to be.\n\nJacob: Yeah, I think there are a couple things going on there. One is just day-to-day stuff, what they see\u2014like, \u201cLook, there are a lot of homeless people around the Twitter offices and open-air drug use.\u201d But I think some of these people have also realized it doesn\u2019t take necessarily a lot of money to buy an election. Like Sacks himself, he gave $1 million to J.D. Vance, to his PAC, but he can afford it. The stuff in San Francisco, he has probably donated in the hundreds of thousands of dollars collectively, I would think, so you can get something for your money there, and yeah, I think in the end they also are just not interested in noncarceral solutions to this stuff.\n\nAlex: You get rich enough, your attitude just becomes, \u201cI can pay to make this thing that I don\u2019t like go away.\u201d\n\nJacob: Yeah.\n\nLaura: A lot of his contributions have been focused in California. Do you think that the recall of Boudin and the success that that campaign had heralds more activity like this on a national level? What do you think is next for Sacks and the group of like-minded activists?\n\nJacob: I do. I think a couple things are going to happen. One, I ended my article with a quote from him saying, \u201cThis model needs to be replicated across the country.\u201d\n\nLaura: That\u2019s a direct quote.\n\nJacob: Yeah. I think [it] somewhat depends on their commitment. Thiel has recently said that \u201cwe\u2019re a little too negative. We don\u2019t really have a positive program.\u201d Big surprise, they need that. They need some positive program. But they all seem to like DeSantis as the more respectable alternative perhaps to Trumpism. During the elections or as votes were being counted, Sacks basically posted some stuff about DeSantis, \u201cProud of his reelection. It\u2019s time for DeSantis in 2024.\u201d I think \u2026 what you\u2019re gonna see is both an attempt to roll back criminal justice reform, recall who they can just by using their money, and then [push] their crew. I mean, some of them lost, like Oz, who they\u2019ve raised money for, and Blake Masters\u2014\n\nLaura: Another Thiel co-author.\n\nJacob: Yeah, another Thiel employee. But J.D. Vance, they\u2019re gonna push their guys who made it in. Then I think DeSantis is going to be their stalking horse who they\u2019ll try to assemble behind for 2024.\n\nLaura: Thanks so much, Jacob.\n\nJacob: Sure thing. Glad to do it.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "In a landmark ruling, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) rejected Google's request to suspend an antitrust ruling on the tech giant's Android operating system. The decision marks a major setback for the U.S. tech giant, which has been at the center of antitrust investigations since 2018. The company sought to ban CCI from enforcing its November 2020 decision that it abused its market power by requiring phone manufacturers to preinstall certain Google apps. In its ruling, the Competition Commission of India found that Google's Android operating system was used to give its search engine an unfair advantage over its competitors. The CCI further argued that Google's use of its App Store as a monopoly forced device manufacturers to install Google apps suppressed competition in the market. Google tried to block the ruling, arguing that allegations of anti-competitive conduct were \"unfounded\" and did not receive a fair hearing before the CCI. However, the CCI ruled against Google, stating that it had conducted a thorough investigation before deciding on the tech giant. Google said in a statement that it was disappointed with the decision and \"will continue to defend our ability to freely develop and deliver products to users, and ensure that Android remains an open platform.\" The Competition Commission's ruling is a major victory for the antitrust movement and could have far-reaching implications for other tech giants, such as Amazon, Apple, and Facebook. It also warns technology giants that they must comply with antitrust laws or face consequences. Both the United States and the European Union have launched antitrust investigations against some tech giants. Google is facing antitrust investigations in the US and Europe, and the U.S. Department of Justice recently filed a lawsuit against the company. In July 2018, the European Commission imposed a fine of EUR4.3 billion ($5.1 billion) on Google for abuse of its Android operating system's market power. The commission also ordered Google to stop requiring device manufacturers to preinstall Google Search and Chrome on their devices. In response to CCI's ruling, Ajit Mohan, CEO of Google India, said the company respected the committee's decision and was committed to \"a commitment to an open, competitive and vibrant application ecosystem.\" He added that Google would continue to work with partners to ensure Indian users had access to a range of products and services. The CCI's ruling is a landmark decision that could have far-reaching implications for the way tech giants do business in India. It sets an important precedent, and sends significant signals about the vibrant antitrust movement in India.It will be interesting to see how this decision affects the future behavior of technology giants in India and around the world.", "label": "machine"}

Read our review Read Our Review A looong arrow, pointing right\n\nReview: Is the Discover it Cash Back the best credit card for you?\n\nIf you prefer earning cash-back credit card rewards without paying an annual fee, the Discover it\u00ae Cash Back is a great choice. The card offers a solid 5% cash back in popular rotating quarterly bonus categories when you activate, on up to $1,500 in combined spending (then 1%). You'll also earn 1% back everywhere else (from January 1 to March 31, 2023, you can earn 5% cash back at grocery stores, drug stores and select streaming services on up to $1,500 in purchases after enrollment, then 1%).\n\nWhile the card doesn't offer a traditional welcome bonus, Discover will match all of the rewards you earn from the Discover it\u00ae Cash Back after the first 12 months through its Cashback Match program, so your 5% rewards are effectively worth 10% cash back in the first year. That's an amazing deal for a card with no annual fee.\n\nFor 2022, the Discover 5% quarterly bonus calendar categories are as follows:\n\nQ1 (January - March): Grocery stores and fitness club/gym memberships\n\nQ2 (April - June): Gas stations and Target\n\nQ3 (July - September): Restaurants and PayPal\n\nQ4 (October - December): Amazon.com and digital wallets\n\nThe Discover it\u00ae Cash Back is great for those who don't want to pay an annual fee, and it also comes with a 0% intro APR for 15 months on purchases and balance transfers, then an APR of 15.74% - 26.74% Variable (as of 12/15/2022). That's a nice feature if you have purchases coming up that you want to pay off over time without accruing interest.\n\nKeep in mind that Discover cards are not quite as widely accepted as those from larger issuers, so you may want to carry this card and a backup if you can't use it. However, acceptance has grown in recent years, and with no annual fee, there's little harm in pairing your Discover it\u00ae Cash Back with another cash-back card.\n\nFor example, you could look at a no-annual-fee card that offers a flat cash-back rate on all purchases, like the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card, which earns 2% cash rewards on spending. Or, consider the Chase Freedom Flex\u2120 , which also offers quarterly rotating 5% bonus categories with the same spending cap when you activate.\n\nThere's also the Citi Custom Cash\u2120 Card, which earns 5% cash back on up to $500 spent in your top eligible spending category (from a list) each billing cycle (then 1%), and 1% back on everything else. This card doesn't require you to activate the bonus, so it may be a better choice if you prefer a hands-off approach.\n\nWe're focused here on the rewards and perks that come with each card. These cards won't be worth it if you're paying interest or late fees. When using a credit card, it's important to pay your balance in full each month, make payments on time, and only spend what you can afford to pay.\n\nHow to earn rewards with the Discover it Cash Back card\n\nTo earn the most cash back with the Discover it\u00ae Cash Back, you'll have to activate the rotating bonus categories each quarter through your online Discover account.\n\nOnce you've activated the bonus, you'll earn 5% cash back on up to $1,500 in combined spending (then 1%) in that quarter's categories (from January 1 to March 31, 2023, you can earn 5% cash back at grocery stores, drug stores and select streaming services on up to $1,500 in purchases after enrollment, then 1%). All other purchases earn a flat rate of 1% cash back.\n\nDiscover will automatically match, dollar-for-dollar, all the cash back you've earned at the end of your first year (even on bonus categories). You don't need to do anything to activate this match.\n\nHow to use Discover cash back rewards\n\nThe best way to redeem your Discover it\u00ae Cash Back rewards is usually as a statement credit, which lowers your balance, or simply take the cash as a direct deposit to your bank account. You can also redeem your rewards directly when you check out at Amazon. In any of these cases, the minimum redemption amount is 1 cent.\n\nYou can also use your rewards, starting at $5, for gift cards or eCertificates from partner retailers. As long as your account is open, your cash-back rewards will not expire.\n\nOne somewhat unique redemption option is the ability to donate your rewards to select charities, with a minimum of 1 cent. While this could make it more complicated to get a charitable donation tax deduction compared to writing a check or making a donation directly with a card, it's nice to see the ability to use your cash to support causes close to your heart.\n\nDiscover charity partners: American Cancer Society\n\nASPCA\n\nAmerican Red Cross\n\nCarbonfund.org\n\nChildren's Miracle Network\n\nJunior Achievement\n\nJuvenile Diabetes Research Foundation\n\nMake-A-Wish\n\nOperation Homefront\n\nWorld Wildlife Fund\n\nDiscover it Cash Back benefits and features\n\nThe Discover it\u00ae Cash Back is a fairly straightforward card.

{"text": "Authorities said eight people, including five children, were found shot dead in a house in Utah on Saturday. Officials have not released the identity of the victim, but police are looking for a person in connection with the case, which reportedly took place around 5:30 p.m. in the small town of Springville. According to police, the police responded to a domestic violence phone call from one residence and found several people dead in the home. Lieutenant Cory Slayton, spokesman for the Springville Police Department, said investigators had identified a family incident at his home. He said police were looking for Joshua Boren, a 44-year-old man linked to the shooting. \"He may be armed and dangerous, so if anyone has any information about his whereabouts, or if someone knows or sees him, please call 911,\" Slayton said. Slayton said police had not yet determined the motive for the shooting and that an investigation was still ongoing. He said five children and three adults were found dead at his home, while another adult was taken to a hospital in an unknown condition. \"This is a very tragic event and we are shocked by the loss of so many community members,\" Slayton said. Slayton said detectives have been in contact with the victims' families and are providing them with counseling resources. \"This is a tragedy that has far-reaching implications for families, friends and the community as a whole, and we are trying to give them all the support we can,\" Slayton said. Springville, located about 45 miles south of Salt Lake City, is a small city of around 30,000 people. Local residents were shocked by the shooting and expressed their thoughts and prayers to the families of the victims. \"It's heartbreaking. This community is so connected that we take care of each other,\" said Alena Hawks, a Springville resident who lives near the shooting site. Utah Governor Spencer Cox issued a statement Saturday night saying he felt \"destroyed\" by the news. \"Tonight, the 1.3 million residents of Utah are saddened by the families affected by this terrible tragedy,\" Cox said. \"Like all of you, I'm shocked by the news from Springville,\" he said, \"the lives lost in this terrible tragedy are in our thoughts and prayers, and we're trying to understand how that happened.\" Local and state law enforcement officials have yet to provide further details in the investigation, nor have they released a motive for the shooting. The Springville Police Department urged anyone with any information about the incident to contact them. \"Our thoughts and prayers will be conveyed to the families affected by this tragedy,\" Slayton said. \"Our hearts are heavy, but our mission and commitment remain strong.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The world's leading economist said the global economy could face a decade of slowing growth as central banks around the world are still struggling to find ways to spur a slow recovery. Princeton University professor Paul Krugman said at the World Economic Forum in Davos this morning that many countries are stuck in a \"low growth balance\" as global economic efforts re-establish themselves, making it difficult for governments to achieve their economic goals. The economist warned that despite a modest rebound in the U.S. in recent months, much of the world is still in a \"serious recession,\" and warned that global economic growth could take as long as 10 years to return to pre-epidemic levels. \"There's a sense that we see some kind of trap in the world economy, but the fact is that growth rates in many countries are still far below pre-epidemic levels,\" he said. He cites a number of factors to explain why the global economy is unlikely to return to pre-epidemic levels in the near future. These include uncertain political and economic prospects for the United States, continued restrictions on international travel, and the continuing impact of the coronavirus pandemic. \"It's not just the epidemic itself, it's how it reshapes our understanding of the global economy,\" he said. Krugman also pointed out that globalization has \"slowed\" and that countries are moving inward, increasingly adopting protectionism. He argued that this is creating a drag on growth as countries focus more on protecting their domestic industries than promoting global trade. Many countries in the world still face economic uncertainty, high unemployment and slow economic growth. The International Monetary Fund recently warned that global economic output will not return to pre-epidemics levels until 2024, and that the global recession will be longer and more devastating than previously thought. The World Bank has also revised its global growth forecast for 2021, which expects GDP to grow by 4.3%, down from the previous 5.2%. The potential for a decade of low growth has led to a reassessment of economic policies, and global central banks have turned to unconventional methods to stimulate the recovery. For example, the United States Federal Reserve recently announced a new round of quantitative easing, while other countries such as Japan have introduced fiscal stimulus to boost economic activity. However, Krugman warned that these measures are unlikely to have a significant impact in the short term and argued that the only way to achieve sustained economic growth is through \"structural reform\" of the global economy. In order to achieve sustained economic growth, governments need to focus on promoting global trade, reducing inequality and investing in education and infrastructure. \"We are in a situation where the global economy is facing huge headwinds, and it will take a lot of effort and a lot of innovation to ensure that growth returns to pre-epidemic levels,\" he said. The economists' warning comes from the World Economic Forum in Davos, where world leaders gather in Davos, where economic growth and global recovery will be at the top of the agenda. As policymakers try to find new ways to kick-start a recovery, low growth issues are likely to become the main focus of the conference.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The longest-lived animals on Earth have been around for centuries and live longer than any human ancestor, leaving many of us in awe of their incredible lifespan. From sea turtles to lobsters, from turtles to corals, many are found to be living over 100 years old and have thrived in the environment for more than a century. We rank some of the oldest animals by age to commemorate their incredible longevity. 1. Ocean Quakers Ming, discovered off the coast of Iceland in 2006, was estimated to be 507 years old and was born in 1499. Ming is named after the Chinese dynasty that was then considered its birthplace. Ming's age is determined by the shell that grows each year. This incredible discovery may be a record, but it still isn't the oldest living thing - the title belongs to coral species. 2. Representative, Giant Tortoise The representative, one of the oldest living creatures on Earth before his death in 2019, is believed to have been born at the end of the 19th century and has always lived in a Seychelles reserve, estimated to be over 125 years old by the time of his death. The representative was part of a herd of turtles brought to the island by the Seychellois government in the 19th century and is considered the last surviving member of the colony. 3. Giant lobster In 2007, an estimated 140-year-old giant lobster was discovered off the coast of Australia. This incredible creature, known as \"George\", weighs more than 20 pounds and is believed to be the oldest living thing on Earth, except for some coral species. 4. Matthew Sela tree The Matuselah tree, an ancient species of brown pine found in White Hills, California, is estimated to be more than 4,600 years old and is the world's oldest single living organism. This tree was discovered by a botanist in 1957 with a diameter of more than 4 feet and is believed to be the oldest living tree on Earth. 5. The Mind of the Gorillas In 2006, an incredible animal was discovered off the coast of Iceland, which is estimated to be over 405 years old. Its age is determined by calculating its shell, and they are growing every year. This incredible discovery may be a record, but it's still not the oldest living thing - this title belongs to a coral species. 6. The sea lobster of Posidonius The marine lobster Posidonius (Posidonius) is the oldest recorded living crustaceans on Earth. It was discovered near the Norwegian coast in 2007 and is estimated to be 140 years old. The coronavirus is named after Bosideng, a Greek philosopher and scientist who lived around 150 BC. 7. Tui Malira Tui Malila is the world's oldest known living tree, found in the island nation of Tonga and estimated to be more than 3,000 years old. The tree is a very rare palm tree that has existed since at least the 8th century and is the oldest living thing in Tonga. 8. The Seychelles Giant Tortoise Jonathan Jonathan was discovered in 1789 and died in 2018 at an estimated age of about 185. Jonathan is believed to be the oldest living creature on Earth for some time, many years longer than his peers. 9. Galapagos sea turtle It is believed that she was born in the early 20th century and lives on Santa Cruz Island in the Galapagos Islands. The island has exceeded its species' average life span by about 80 years, making it one of the oldest living creatures on Earth. 10. Shark A Greenland shark was discovered in 2016, estimated to be more than 400 years old. This incredible shark can live longer than other vertebrates, and scientists believe that this particular specimen is one of the most common species found in a tropical region around the world.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "As the coronavirus epidemic continues to damage the travel industry, experts warn travelers to be extra careful and prepared when booking flights. The days when the airport takes off at will and has a relatively carefree experience are now past. Travelers now need to have a backup plan in case of flight cancellations or delays, and be prepared to face new challenges as they navigate the airport. \"Airlines can't save you,\" said Seth Miller, founder and editor of the travel blog The Wandering Aramean, \"you have to take more responsibility for your journey.\" The epidemic is catastrophic for airlines, many of which are struggling to stay afloat amid travel restrictions and declining demand. As a result, some operators are slashing services or completely cutting routes. The aviation industry has been hit particularly hard by the epidemic, with passenger numbers falling to their lowest level in more than 40 years. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, in November 2020, U.S. airlines had only 40 percent capacity compared with a year ago. This has led to more flight cancellations, longer ticket refund waiting times and stricter security protocols. The airport experienced a sharp drop in traffic and decreased funding, leading to reductions in personnel and resources. The epidemic is catastrophic for airlines and airport operations, with many struggling to survive. While some travelers have begun planning to travel again, experts are urging caution and preparation. \"Airlines can't save you,\" said Michael Gold, founder and president of The Points Guy, a website dedicated to helping travelers maximize their mileage and points. This means conducting research and selecting airlines and airports that have a good safety and reliability record. The Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) reports that its agents have begun to measure temperatures at certain airports, so travelers should check their destinations' guidelines and protocols before departing. Another issue to consider is the backlog faced by many airlines due to this epidemic. Experts advise travelers to consider options such as flexible ticketing and rebooking in order to avoid waiting. \"You have to think about this process carefully,\" Gold said, \"and if you're booking flights, you should always have a backup plan.\" Experts also recommend making a contingency plan in case your flight is canceled. For example, if you're traveling with family members, consider having them book a flight at another airline in case your flight is canceled. This also applies to hotels and other bookings, Miller said. \"You want to make sure you have a backup plan in case the person you're referring to fails,\" he said. Finally, experts recommend that travellers be kept informed of the latest developments in their destinations, especially any epidemic-related restrictions and policies that may affect their travel. \"The key is to keep abreast of the situation,\" Kim said, \"know what happened, know what your rights are, and have a backup plan.\" Although the epidemic has been a major setback for tourism, experts say it is possible to return to the road with careful preparation and planning. \"You've got to be smart, you've got to be clever, you've got to be ready,\" Miller said, \"but if you do all these things, you can still enjoy the journey.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Up to $140 million Indonesia's ride-hailing and food delivery giant GoTo plunged 6 percent on Thursday as the company revealed a record nine-month financial loss of $140 million. The company's losses were almost double the $73 million it lost in the same period last year, and the company said that its losses were due to rising costs, competition from other companies, and challenges from local governments. The Jakarta-based GoTo is Indonesia's largest ride-hailing company and operates the country's largest food delivery service, GoFood. Since its launch in 2015, it has raised $3.5 billion in investment. GoTo CEO and co-founder Nadiem Makarim said in a statement that the company faces significant challenges in its current competitive environment, such as increased costs associated with customer acquisitions and increased competition from rival companies. He added that the company also faced challenges from local governments over its business model, including proposed regulations requiring its drivers to obtain a license. Makarim also referred to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, saying that declining demand for travel and leisure services had an impact on its results. The announcement caused GoTo's stock to drop 6.4 percent on the Jakarta Stock Exchange to Rs 3,175.00, its lowest closing level in nearly a month. GoTo has struggled to compete with rivals such as Grab and Uber, which have greater influence in the region. To stay competitive, GoTo announced in August a strategic alliance with Chinese taxi company Didi Chuxing that will invest up to $500 million in the company. The alliance also includes joint plans to expand services to other Southeast Asian countries. However, analysts remain skeptical of the company's prospects, saying it has fierce competition in the region and rising costs. In addition, the company has been working to comply with local regulations, particularly recent rules that require its drivers to obtain a local license. This has led to a decline in the number of drivers using its platform, further limiting its growth potential. Despite the challenges, Makarim said he remains confident in the company's ability to adapt to the current environment and remain competitive. \"Our operational excellence, customer and driver engagement, technical and financial strength allows us to chart our own course and control our destiny despite external challenges,\" he said. He added that the company will continue to invest in its core business and focus on improving efficiency to stay competitive. \"We will continue to reduce costs, improve operational efficiency and strengthen the overall financial health of our business,\" he said. Analysts say that in order for the company to reverse its financial performance and maximize its growth potential, it will need to take more aggressive steps to compete with competitors, such as expanding into more markets, launching more services, and investing more in technology and marketing. GoTo has been a huge success in Indonesia, and it's become a household name. But the company faces a tough battle because it wants to expand and become a global player.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": ".. Robert Duncan has been sitting for several weeks. He collected 78 rpm old records - the kind that played songs from the 1920s and 1930s. Duncan has been slowly making some antique records since he was a teenager. But with unexpected career changes and the recent pandemic, Duncan's hobby has retreated into the back seat. So, when he turned to clean the floor, he was shocked to find dozens of records hidden in the dark cracks. As he said, \"I completely forgot them!\" With the discovery of his long-forgotten gems, Duncan decided to do something with them. He contacted a friend, Joanna White, who was a producer at the local NPR affiliate. White advised him to digitize the records and sell them online as part of his digital collection. Duncan was very interested in the idea, and he immediately started work. He collected his own records and began to classify them so as to prepare for a digital recovery. Using specialized software and equipment, Duncan recovered the audio from the record.To his surprise, the recording sounded very lively. \"It's like the first time I heard these songs,\" Duncan said. Over the next few weeks, Duncan worked on making tapes a reality. He picked up artwork for each record, wrote line notes, and then uploaded them to websites he designed with White's help. The response to the album was immediate and overwhelming. These records quickly sold out, and people from all over the world began sending Duncan stories about their memories of these songs. Duncan was very moved by this response, and he decided to donate his collection of recovered records to the National Register of Records. \"It feels like doing the right thing,\" he said, \"These records shouldn't just be lost in my broadcasts - they should be shared with others who appreciate them.\" The National Record Registry, managed by the Library of Congress, is dedicated to preserving historical records for future generations; Duncan's collection is currently the only one of its kind. \"We are honored to keep Robert's collection in our archive,\" said Melanie Brynn, director of the National Record Registry. \"This is a testament to his dedication and passion for protecting these beautiful recordings. We are very grateful that he has entrusted us with these precious songs.\" Duncan's passion for music has inspired countless people around the world. His story reminds us that even in these turbulent times, a little creativity and effort can help protect our past - and shape our future.", "label": "machine"}

She peeked outside her bedroom door a second time when she heard crying coming from the bedroom of her other roommate, Xana Kernodle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok, I\u2019m going to help you,\u201d Mortensen told authorities she heard a male voice say.\n\nShocked Neighbors of Idaho Suspect Say He Was a \u2018Lone Wolf\u2019\n\nThe third time Mortensen opened her bedroom door to a far more terrifying sight: \u201ca figure clad in black clothing and a mask that covered the person\u2019s mouth and nose walking toward her.\u201d But the masked man just walked past her and left the home from the back sliding glass door as she stood there in \u201cfrozen shock.\u201d\n\nHours later, Mortensen would learn that three of her roommates\u2014and one of their boyfriends\u2014had been brutally murdered.\n\nThat\u2019s according to a probable cause affidavit unsealed Thursday, which lays out previously unknown details about what happened in the Moscow, Idaho, rental home the night of the shocking murders that have since captured national attention.\n\nInvestigators \u201cbelieve the homicides occurred between 4:00 a.m. and 4:25 a.m.,\u201d the affidavit states.\n\nOne of the surviving roommates\u2014it has not been revealed which it was\u2014called 911 at 11:58 a.m., police revealed more than a week after the deadly scene unfolded. Cops said \u201cmultiple people\u201d spoke to the dispatcher on that call, which is not mentioned in the affidavit, but was made from one of the roommates\u2019 phones.\n\nIn the document, authorities lay out various details into the killings of four University of Idaho college students\u2014Madison Mogen, 21; Ethan Chapin, 20; and Kernodle and Goncalves. Last week, a team of local, state, and federal law enforcement officers arrested Kohberger, a 28-year-old first-year PhD student in criminology at Washington State University, at his parents\u2019 home in Pennsylvania.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe was extradited back to Idaho on Wednesday and is set to face 2nd District Magistrate Judge Megan Marshall today on four counts of murder in the first degree and a burglary charge.\n\nProviding new details about the lengthy investigation that led to Kohberger\u2019s arrest, investigators detail how authorities found the eerie scene, and eventually matched DNA from a knife sheath found in a bedroom to Kohberger himself.\n\nInvestigators obtained that DNA sample two days after Christmas, when cops \u201crecovered the trash from the Kohberger family residence located in Albrightsville, PA,\u201d and sent it to the Idaho State Lab for testing, the affidavit reveals.\n\nKohberger\u2019s phone had pinged off cell towers near the home \u201con at least twelve occasions prior\u201d to the killings, almost exclusively in the late evening and early-morning hours, the affidavit states.\n\nThe affidavit also provided additional details about Kohberger, including that he applied for an internship with the Pullman Police Department in 2022. In his application, Kohberger wrote an essay expressing his interest \u201cin assisting rural law enforcement agencies with how to better collect and analyze technological data in public safety operations.\u201d\n\nThe probable cause affidavit states that investigators entered the Moscow home on the bottom floor\u2014before walking up stairs to find Kernodle just outside her bedroom door. Authorities say that she had wounds that \u201cappeared to have been caused by a edged weapon.\u201d\n\nInside the room, authorities found Chapin, who sustained deadly \u201csharp-force injuries.\u201d On the third floor, authorities found one bedroom with a dog, where both Goncalves and Mogen were \u201cdeceased with visible stab wounds.\u201d Authorities later noticed a \u201ctan leather knife sheath laying next to Mogen\u2019s right side\u201d bearing the U.S. Marine Corps insignia and crucial DNA evidence on the button snap.\n\nAuthorities also found a latent shoe print at the scene, which showed a \u201cdiamond-shaped pattern (similar to the pattern of a Vans type shoe sole) just outside\u201d Mortensen\u2019s door. Upon reviewing several surveillance cameras on the area, investigators were able to also determine that a white sedan was seen by the house around the time of the murders.\n\nEventually, authorities were able to connect the car to Kohberger\u2014whose license photo revealed he had the same physical description, including his \u201cbushy eyebrows,\u201d that Mortensen detailed to police. The affidavit states that the license plates of the car had been switched shortly after the murders. Kohberger\u2019s phone also pinged off of cell towers near the murder house immediately before and after the killings, but not between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m.\n\nWhile a motive is still unclear, Joseph Giacalone, a former NYPD detective sergeant who now teaches at New York City\u2019s John Jay College of Criminal Justice, sees the fact that two of the six people inside the house were spared, as a possible key insight.\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he kill the eyewitnesses?\u201d Giacalone said Thursday. \u201cWas it \u2018mission-complete\u2019 [for Kohberger]?

{"text": "Someone made the right call. The human call. The only call, really.\n\nWhen it mattered, when only the compassionate decision made sense, the show did not go on.\n\nInstead, Monday Night Football ended in a maelstrom of agony, frustration and 1,000-yard stares. We watched as two teams locked arms in a cocoon of humanity around Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin, who was receiving CPR compressions after colliding with Cincinnati Bengals wideout Tee Higgins and then falling unconscious in front of a national television audience. Nearby, players and staffers cried and held each other. Others pulled at their jerseys and clothing, or simply put their face into their hands and melted.\n\nIn a league that has come to stretch the boundaries of what we accept as normal and part of the gladiator sport, this moment was something different than anything we\u2019ve seen in the social media age of the NFL. The veneer of an impenetrable facade fell way, exposing limitless vulnerability and a reality that has stalked this league forever: There is a line. A brutal, awful line. And the discovery of it was every bit as horrific as we presumed it would be.\n\nAs witnesses, that\u2019s what Monday night represented to us. Something different. A significant inflection point for the NFL, when all the talk about players putting their lives on the line suddenly coalesced into a collective image that won\u2019t soon be forgotten. One that underscored what we\u2019ve learned in so many ways over so many decades: That inside this vicious form of entertainment, every hit carries an inherent danger of changing someone\u2019s life forever. Or ending it altogether.\n\nWe absorbed that Monday night. The brutal, awful line that finally became so clear that someone involved \u2014 maybe nearly everyone involved \u2014 understood that no game should be unstoppable. Not for our entertainment. Not for ratings and commercial sponsors. Not for the trivialities of sports betting and fantasy football. Not even for the long-embraced tradeoff that we\u2019ve been sold for so long, that risking life and limb is simply an extension of a football contract.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bills' Siran Neal (33) and Nyheim Hines react as medical personnel attend to teammate Damar Hamlin on Monday night. (AP Photo/Jeff Dean)\n\nWe\u2019ve always known there is such a thing as too far, even in the NFL. What we didn\u2019t know is what it would look like or how it would make us feel. When we wake up Tuesday, we won\u2019t be able to say that anymore. Instead, players will know that it feels like losing a sense of invincibility, resilience and control. Fans will know it feels like staring at an image and begging for a player to simply move, anything that returns the moment back to the warped relief of the phrase \u201che has feeling in his extremities.\u201d\n\nPerhaps most important, the NFL will know what it\u2019s like to have every part of the machine simply refuse to respond in the face of a nightmare. The league got a good look at players who were never going to play again that night. Coaches who were never going to coach. Fans and journalists who \u2014 for the most part \u2014 refused to engage in absurd rationalizations about what a cancellation could mean for logistics or playoff implications.\n\nFor once, maybe the first time since the NFL shut down briefly in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, something else had to be more important than the product. That something was the safety of Damar Hamlin and the well-being of everyone around him. If that wasn\u2019t more important than finishing a prime-time football game, it would validate the criticism of everyone who framed the league as a soulless money machine.\n\nThis is why we scoffed when the ESPN broadcast suggested play would go on after a 5-minute warmup. Nothing about that made sense. The grief and backlash after hearing it \u2014 everything about that made sense. The NFL has denied knowing where that suggestion came from, but it certainly didn\u2019t end up on the broadcast from nowhere. For a league reputation dogged by skeptics and conspiracy theorists, the moment will never truly be settled.\n\nIn the end, what matters most is that the machine stopped. The line was recognized by someone, somewhere. And when that happened, it allowed us to turn all of our attention to Hamlin, which is where it belonged from the moment he collapsed on the field from cardiac arrest.\n\nDamar Hamlin, pictured here on Dec. 1, is fighting for his life in a Cincinnati hospital after suffering cardiac arrest during a game Monday night. (AP Photo/Greg M. Cooper)\n\nAs former Pittsburgh Steelers safety Ryan Clark framed it on ESPN on Monday night, \u201cFor over 100 grown adult men, who their entire lives have put on pads and understood the risk you take every time you do it, to be speechless, to be in tears, to be gathered in prayer, that tells you how significant this moment was. \u2026\n\n\"In truth, if the NFL cares about the players, this is the first time I believe the NFL truly had to care about the players\u2019 emotional and mental health as well. This is the first time we got to watch those emotions, we got to watch that type of thought process right in front of us.\u201d\n\nThe unfolding of this lesson has long seemed inevitable. And as we imagined, the cost to learn it was as awful as it was predictable. Damar Hamlin is fighting for his life in the hospital and the moment that may have changed his life now resides in our memory forever.\n\nThis was the most terrible way to learn where the NFL\u2019s line between entertainment and humanity gets drawn. Not to mention how much is actually being risked on either side of it.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN \u2014\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un is calling for an \u201cexponential increase\u201d in his country\u2019s nuclear weapons arsenal in response to what he claims are threats from South Korea and the United States, Pyongyang\u2019s state media reported Sunday.\n\nKim\u2019s comments come as North Korea twice over the weekend tested what it claimed was a large, nuclear-capable, multiple-launch rocket system that could put all of South Korea in its range, according to a report from the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).\n\nSpeaking on New Year\u2019s Eve on the final day of a six-day plenary session that reviewed 2022, Kim said South Korea has become an \u201cundoubted enemy\u201d and its main ally, the US, has increased pressure on the North to the \u201cmaximum\u201d level over the past year by frequently deploying its military assets to the Korean Peninsula.\n\nNorth Korea's leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday praised the country's \"super-large\" Multiple Rocket Launcher (MRL), which he claims will put all of South Korea within range and can be loaded with tactical nuclear warheads. KCNA\n\nIn response, Kim said in the coming year that Pyonyang must mass produce tactical nuclear weapons while developing a new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that would give the North a \u201cquick counterstrike capability,\u201d according to the KCNA report.\n\nKim\u2019s comments come at the end of a year that saw his regime test more missiles than at any time in North Korean history, including an ICBM that could in theory strike the US mainland.\n\nOn Saturday, in its 37th day of missile tests in 2022, North Korea fired at least three short-range ballistic missiles from a site south of Pyongyang, according to South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nIt followed that early Sunday with another test. North Korea said both Saturday\u2019s and Sunday\u2019s tests were of a 600mm multiple-launch rocket (MRL) system. Most multiple-rocket launch systems in service around the world are around 300mm in size.\n\nThe 600mm MRL was first introduced three years ago, and production has been increased since late October of 2022 for deployment, Kim said in his speech to the plenary session on Saturday, according to KCNA. He later added that an additional 30 of the 600mm MRL will be deployed to the military simultaneously.\n\nKim said the weapon is capable of overcoming high landforms, can consecutively strike with precision, has all of South Korea in its shooting range and can be loaded with tactical nuclear warheads, according to the KCNA report.\n\n\u201cProspectively, as a key offensive weapon of our military forces, it will carry out its own combat mission to overwhelm the enemy,\u201d Kim said.\n\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, pictured on November 2, 2022, said his country should respond with clear retaliation to North Korea's provocations. Yonhap/Reuters\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry later responded to Kim\u2019s comments, calling them \u201cprovocative language that seriously harms peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula.\u201d\n\nThe ministry urged Pyongyang to \u201cimmediately stop\u201d developing nuclear weapons and return to the path of denuclearization, warning that the \u201cKim Jong Un regime will come to an end if North Korea attempts to use nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\nThe ministry vowed to maintain its military readiness posture to \u201cfirmly respond\u201d to any North Korean threats, adding that the military will strengthen its \u201cthree-axis\u201d defense system designed to counter North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile threats.\n\nThe three-axis defense system consists of the Kill Chain preemptive strike system, the Korea Air and Missile Defense system and the Korea Massive Punishment and Retaliation plan, an operational plan to incapacitate the North Korean leadership in a major conflict.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s President Yoon Suk Yeol said on Sunday during a phone call with military chiefs that North Korea will continue to conduct constant nuclear and missile provocations, and South Korea\u2019s military should respond with clear retaliation, his office said.\n\nExpert: North Korea expanding capabilities\n\nLeif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said Pyongyang has used the past year to demonstrate its ability to perform a range of military strikes.\n\n\u201cIts recent missile launches were not technically impressive. Instead, the high volume of tests at unusual times and from various locations demonstrate that North Korea could launch different types of attack, anytime, and from many directions,\u201d Easley said.\n\nEasley also noted that it\u2019s not just missiles that North Korea is using to up the military pressure on the South. Last week, Pyongyang flew five drones into South Korean airspace, forcing Seoul to scramble fighter jets and helicopters to track them and later to send its own drones into North Korean airspace.\n\nIt all leads to an escalation of tensions, according to Easley.\n\n\u201cSuch provocations, including drone incursions, appear excessive for deterrence and may be intended to scare South Korea into taking a softer policy. But with Kim disavowing diplomacy and threatening to mass produce nuclear weapons, the Yoon administration is likely to further increase South Korea\u2019s defense capabilities and readiness,\u201d Easley said.\n\nFor its part, South Korea is beefing up forces, too.\n\nSeoul\u2019s Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) announced last month it will spend more than $2.7 billion over 10 years to strengthen the mission capabilities and survivability of its fleet of F-15K fighters, jets that would play a key role in any possible strikes on North Korea.\n\nWashington is also not standing still. As well as deploying assets like F-22 fighters and B-1 bombers to the exercises around the Korean Peninsula, the US military recently activated its first Space Force command on foreign soil in South Korea, with the unit\u2019s new commander saying he is ready to face any threat in the region.\n\nThe new unit \u201cwill be tasked with coordinating space operations and services such as missile warning, position navigation and timing and satellite communications within the region,\u201d according to US Forces Korea.\n\nEven before Kim\u2019s latest remarks, experts had noted the big strides Pyongyang had made in its missile forces over the past year.\n\nAnkit Panda, a nuclear policy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told CNN in mid-December that Pyongyang has emerged as a missile power.\n\n\u201cThe bigger picture is that North Korea is literally turning into a prominent operator of large-scale missile forces,\u201d Panda said. \u201cThe word test is no longer appropriate to talk about most North Korean missile launches.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost of the missiles they\u2019ve launched this year are parts of military exercises. They are rehearsing for nuclear war. And that, I think, is the big picture this year,\u201d Panda said.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Saving a pet may be one of the most rewarding experiences, but it can also come with some unexpected consequences. Last month, when I and my partner decided to buy a dog instead of saving one, I learned it for myself. It made us lose a friend. We've been talking about adopting pets for a while, and we have some options. We can go to the shelter looking for the perfect match, or we can buy from the breeder.We decided to go with the breeder. The breeder had a bunch of puppies, they were lovely. We settled down on a golden hound and took him home. The dog was amazing. We called him \"Taz\", he fits our family, we love him and are happy to have him. But there's a problem. Our friends are dissatisfied with our decision to buy a dog instead of saving one. They insist that we should go the rescue route, and they are very disappointed with our choice. They say that buying a dog will only make the inhuman industry last, as if they were judging us. We had endless conversations about it, but there seemed to be no way of changing their minds. Eventually we stopped talking altogether and decided to focus only on Taz and our shared lives. But a few months later, I began to feel uneasy about our decision. As someone who cares deeply about animal welfare, I can no longer ignore this issue. I realized that I had to take action to make up for our choices. So I started researching shelters and rescue organizations in our area. I also contacted friends and family who adopted pets to ask for their opinions. After a lot of research and conversation, I decided to volunteer at the local animal rescue activities. I was hesitant at first, but it wasn't long before I really enjoyed it. I started taking part in adoptions and helping rescue organizations spread the word about magical animals that needed a home. I was also able to take away the animals that I felt needed a home and find an everlasting family for them. I'm glad I decided to give back. But even though I love volunteering, that doesn't make up for the choice we made to buy tazz from breeders. I still feel guilty and our friends are disappointed. We donate to animal shelters, talk with friends about the importance of adoption, and even share our stories on social media that encourage people to save rather than buy. Finally, it worked. Our friends saw that we were trying to help them and they appreciated it. We also had a better understanding of the problem, and we knew that buying pets was not the right choice. Saving pets is one of the best ways to bring new life to neglected animals, and it can be very beneficial. I learned from my experience that it can also have unexpected consequences. I encourage everyone to think carefully about their decisions and consider their impact, whether good or bad.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Jan 4 (Reuters) - Myanmar's military government will release 7,012 prisoners under an amnesty to mark the country's independence day, state broadcaster MRTV reported on Wednesday, as the junta chief praised some countries for maintaining support for his nation.\n\nThe Southeast Asian country has faced international isolation and Western-led sanctions since the military seized power from a democratically elected government led by Nobel laureate Aung Sang Suu Kyi nearly two years ago.\n\n\"I want to say thank you to some international and regional countries and organisations and individuals who positively cooperated with us... in the midst of all the pressure, criticisms and attacks,\" Senior General Min Aung Hlaing said in a speech to mark Myanmar's 75th independence day.\n\n\"We are closely working with neighbouring countries such as China, India, Thailand, Laos and Bangladesh. We will work together for border stability and development,\" Min Aung Hlaing said in a speech at a parade in the capital Naypyitaw, complete with flag-waving civil servants, marching soldiers, tanks and a flypast by military jets.\n\nMyanmar has been in chaos since the army took power from Suu Kyi's government on Feb. 1, 2021, detaining her and other officials and responding to pro-democracy protests and dissent with brutal force, displacing hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nWhile street protests are now rare after bloody crackdowns, the military is involved in almost daily clashes with minority ethnic forces and insecurity has spread to swathes of the country as members of a so-called People's Defence Force have taken up arms to fight for a return to democracy.\n\nMeanwhile, Suu Kyi was recently convicted of five counts of corruption and jailed for seven more years, wrapping up a marathon of trials condemned internationally as a sham designed to keep the junta's biggest threat at bay amid widespread domestic resistance to its rule.\n\nSuu Kyi is being held in a jail in Naypyitaw in solitary confinement and the military insist she has received due process by an independent court.\n\nAuthorities typically release some prisoners to mark the day when Myanmar declared independence from British rule.\n\nMRTV said the latest amnesty would not include those convicted of murder and rape, or jailed for charges related to explosives, unlawful association, weapons, drugs, natural disaster management and corruption.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if any political detainees would be freed.\n\nThe United States, the European Union and countries such as Britain and Canada, have imposed sanctions on Myanmar's military and individuals deemed to have helped the junta come to power.\n\nIn a further rebuke, the U.N. Security Council last month adopted its first resolution on Myanmar in 74 years, demanding an end to violence and for the junta to free all political detainees.\n\nReferring to international pressure, Min Aung Hlaing hit out at what he said were \"disruptions from countries and organizations who want to intervene in Myanmar's internal affairs.\"\n\nStill, the junta has maintained some international support. The U.N. Security Council remains split over how to deal with the Myanmar crisis, with China and Russia arguing against strong action. They also abstained from last month's vote on a resolution, along with India.\n\nThailand also hosted regional talks last month to discuss the crisis, including rare international appearances by junta ministers, even as several key members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, vocal in their criticism of the junta, did not attend.\n\nASEAN is leading diplomatic peace efforts and Myanmar's generals have been barred from the bloc's high-profile gatherings for failing to honour promises to start talks with opponents linked to Suu Kyi's ousted government.\n\nReporting by Reuters Staff Writing by Ed Davies Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "label": "human"}

It comes at a time of significant volatility and uncertainty in global energy markets, with the IEA stating that Russia's invasion of Ukraine in Feb. 2022 had \"sharply altered the dynamics of coal trade, price levels, and supply and demand patterns in 2022.\" \"Coal markets have been shaken severely in 2022, with traditional trade flows disrupted, prices soaring and demand set to grow by 1.2%, reaching an all-time high and surpassing 8 billion metric tons for the first time,\" the IEA said in its Coal 2022 report, published Dec. 16. The price of fossil fuels saw a substantial jump this year, the agency said, \"with natural gas showing the sharpest increase.\" \"This has prompted a wave of fuel switching away from gas, pushing up demand for more price competitive options, including coal in some regions,\" it added.\n\nDespite the increase in coal demand, the picture is a complex one. The IEA noted that \"higher coal prices, strong deployment of renewables and energy efficiency, and weakening global economic growth are tempering the increase in overall coal demand this year.\" It said that coal use in electricity generation was set to rise by a little over 2% this year. Coal usage in industry is actually slated to fall by more than 1%, with this decline attributed to lower steel and iron production. \"The world is close to a peak in fossil fuel use, with coal set to be the first to decline, but we are not there yet,\" IEA Director of Energy Markets and Security Keisuke Sadamori said in a statement. \"Coal demand is stubborn and will likely reach an all-time high this year, pushing up global emissions.\" \"At the same time, there are many signs that today's crisis is accelerating the deployment of renewables, energy efficiency and heat pumps \u2014 and this will moderate coal demand in the coming years,\" he added. Government policies would be \"key to ensuring a secure and sustainable path forward,\" he said.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "In late August this year, Sergey Brin headed to Burning Man.\n\nThe billionaire Google cofounder is no stranger to the hedonistic festival \u2014 he's attended for years \u2014 but 2022's gathering was the first official \"Burn\" since the pandemic upended the world.\n\nThe 49-year-old tech titan traveled to the festival in style, island-hopping across the Pacific Ocean in a modified seaplane. Once he got to the \"playa\" \u2014 the roughly 7-square-mile patch of desert in northwestern Nevada where Burning Man takes place \u2014 Brin, topless and festooned with a space-age, bandolier-style necklace, partied alongside the other 80,000 festivalgoers.\n\nBut the eight-day celebration in the sand isn't the only psychedelic gathering that Brin has attended over the past year, Insider found in an investigation into Brin and fellow cofounder Larry Page's lives since stepping back from Google's parent company, Alphabet, in 2019.\n\nDespite Brin's divorce from the lawyer and philanthropist Nicole Shanahan, which became tabloid fodder after lurid (and disputed) allegations surfaced that Shanahan had a secret tryst with Brin's fellow billionaire and onetime confidant Elon Musk, he still made time for a whirlwind of social engagements, parties, and impromptu concerts. A spokesperson for Brin declined to comment on the record.\n\nBrin spent his Thanksgiving holiday in 2021 with a member of the Russian punk band Pussy Riot, who shared on Instagram a since-deleted video of Brin hula-hooping. And according to people in attendance, he swung by a Burning Man-themed event earlier this year at Wilbur Hot Springs, an exclusive resort in Northern California owned by a coterie of space entrepreneurs. Brin has been spotted more than once at house parties at NeoGenesis, a coliving space for entrepreneurs in the Bay Area.\n\nA post shared by Ben Holfeld (@benholfeld)\n\nOver the summer, in the weeks after the Musk allegations emerged in The Wall Street Journal, Brin was photographed at dinner with the illusionist David Blaine and a \"mystery blonde woman,\" The Daily Mail reported. He found himself onstage with a middle-aged math teacher's rock band in New York City. (It's unclear how this surreal jam session came about.) Earlier in the year, he hobnobbed with the Hollywood elite at Vanity Fair's exclusive Oscars party in Los Angeles.\n\nHe also stopped by a launch party in July celebrating the mushroom startup Shroomboom in the Topanga hills just north of Los Angeles, where a DJ duo created experimental electronic music by wiring up fungi to a sound system and guests openly consumed psychedelic mushrooms. As for the bigger psychedelic party, when Burning Man reopened in August after its pandemic hiatus, Brin stayed at First Camp, a VIP community frequented by festival organizers and their friends.\n\nBut for all the partying, boats, and personal turbulence, associates insist Brin still has time for more industrious pursuits. The Wall Street Journal this summer reported that the former Ph.D. candidate was spending some time writing a physics textbook. (It's not clear what its focus will be.) He is fascinated by climate technology, including carbon-trading networks, and has a keen interest in psychedelics, peers say. He also has time for athletic pursuits: Brin once dedicated a year to learning all the sports in the decathlon, from the shot put to hurdles. And he was once a regular at the Mavericks surf contest in Half Moon Bay near San Francisco, where he would sometimes hitch a ride in a rescue boat. In his remaining downtime, Brin enjoys juggling.\n\n\"If he could live like a normal guy, I think he would prefer to do that,\" a former colleague told Insider. \"He's a tech nerd at heart and probably wickedly smart and genius. You mix that with some good luck and timing, you end up with Sergey Brin.\"\n\nHugh Langley is a correspondent at Insider covering Alphabet and Google.\n\nRob Price is a correspondent at Insider, writing features and investigations about the technology industry.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "OpenAI logo seen on screen with ChatGPT website displayed on mobile seen in this illustration in Brussels, Belgium, on December 12, 2022. Jonathan Raa | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nYou may have heard the recent buzz around ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence chatbot that was released to the public at the end of November. I've read about people using the service to write their school essays and I was curious as to how it could help me in my daily life. The technology was developed by OpenAI, a research company backed by Microsoft and others. ChatGPT automatically generates text based on written prompts in an advanced and creative way. It can even carry out a conversation that feels pretty close to one you'd have with a human being.\n\nChatGPT homepage.\n\nThis got me wondering -- is ChatGPT smart enough to change how we find information online? Could it someday replace Google and other search engines? Some Google employees are certainly worried about the possibility, At a company all-hands last week, CNBC's Jen Elias reported, employees recently asked execs if an AI-chatbot like ChatGPT was a \"missed opportunity\" for the company. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and Jeff Dean, the long-time head of Google's AI division, responded by saying that the company has similar capabilities, but that the cost if something goes wrong would be greater because people have to trust the answers they get from Google. Morgan Stanley published a report on the topic on Monday, Dec. 12 examining whether ChatGPT is a threat to Google. Brian Nowak, the bank's lead analyst on Alphabet, wrote that language models could take market share \"and disrupt Google's position as the entry point for people on the Internet.\" However, Nowak said the firm is still confident in Google's position because the company is continuing to improve search, and creating behavioral change is a huge hurdle -- a lot of internet users use Google as a habit. Additionally, Google is \"building similar natural language models such as LaMDA\" which could find their way into new products. For now, OpenAI's creators are cautious about making any big claims. Generally speaking, the more users employ ChatGPT, the better it gets. But it still has a lot to learn. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a tweet on Dec. 10 that ChatGPT is \"incredibly limited\" and \"it's a mistake to be relying on it for anything important right now.\" Either way, I wanted to see how well the chatbot would work as an alternative to Google's search engine. Instead of Googling my questions throughout the day, I asked ChatGPT. Here are some of the questions I asked and how ChatGPT responded compared with Google .\n\nChatGPT vs. Google\n\nIt's easy to sign up for ChatGPT \u2014 all you need is an email address. Once you've registered, the webpage is very simple to navigate. There's an area where your results will populate and a text box where you'll type your inquiries. OpenAI says to put in a statement for the best possible result. I recently purchased my second Fiddle Leaf Fern plant for my apartment because the first one died. Now the new one is dying after just a few days. I normally would have asked Google what to do. Instead, I asked ChatGPT. \"How can I keep my Fiddle Leaf Fern plant alive?\"\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards\n\nThe results lined up with the instructions I received from the plant company, Easy Plant, which is where I bought the new Fiddle Leaf Fern. I also liked that I didn't have to go to various different websites like I would have if I'd Googled this question. When I Googled the same question, the top result gave me detailed instructions in an article that included pop-up ads and a way more information than I needed, like links to buy new soil. Winner: ChatGPT. Next, I tried something where more shopping links would actually have been beneficial. I am still trying to find a present for all 8 nights of Hanukkah for my husband, so I decided to ask ChatGPT for some ideas.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards\n\nI didn't give it any information about my husband, besides the fact that the gifts were for Hanukkah. The chatbot then assumed that my husband is kosher and that he's into tech and watches. The latter isn't wrong, but it's not the answers I was hoping for. When I Googled this question I got access to hundreds of articles with different gift ideas and links to websites. For example I got ads to Lululemon and Bombas, which are both companies I've used to buy him gifts before. So in this case, Google used its personalized knowledge of me to find more targeted results from around the web. Winner: Google Next, I decided to ask ChatGPT a question with higher stakes. \"Is it safe to take Benadryl while pregnant?\" I am currently expecting my first child, and I know that taking Benadryl is safe in pregnancy based on information I've received from my doctor. Still, I wanted to see what the chatbot would say.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards\n\nI appreciated that ChatGPT gave me the correct answer, while also noting the importance of consulting a doctor before taking any medications during pregnancy. When I Googled the same medical question, the results were all over the place. At quick glance, one article from TheBump.com quoted a doctor saying \"Generally, it's safe to take Benadryl in the first trimester.\" While other results said similar information to what I received on ChatGPT, without the explicit warning to discuss with my healthcare provider (unless clicking into a specific link). Winner: ChatGPT\n\nCould it replace me?\n\nOne of the claims (or concerns) around ChatGPT \u2014 and artificial intelligence in general \u2014 is that it will replace human workers. So I decided to see if ChatGPT could write this article for me. The results were pretty astonishing. Here's what the chatbot said after I told it to \"write an article about whether or not ChatGPT is a good alternative to Google as a search engine.\" As a large language model trained by OpenAI, I am not capable of conducting research or browsing the internet to gather information on ChatGPT or other search engines. I am only able to provide information based on what I have been trained on, which is limited to the knowledge that was available up until my training cutoff date of 2021. With that being said, it is worth considering the potential advantages and disadvantages of using ChatGPT as a search engine compared to other options, such as Google. One potential advantage of using ChatGPT as a search engine is that it is able to provide more personalized and conversational results. Because ChatGPT is a language model, it is able to understand and respond to natural language queries, allowing users to ask questions and receive answers in a more intuitive and human-like way. This can make the search experience more engaging and interactive, and may be especially useful for users who have specific or complex information needs. On the other hand, there are also potential limitations to using ChatGPT as a search engine. Because it is a large language model and not a traditional search engine, ChatGPT may not have access to the same breadth and depth of information as other search engines. This means that it may not be able to provide as comprehensive or up-to-date results, and may not be as effective for certain types of searches, such as those that require a large amount of data or real-time information. In conclusion, whether or not ChatGPT is a good alternative to Google as a search engine will depend on the specific needs and preferences of the user. It may be a useful option for those who value a more personalized and conversational search experience, but it may not be as comprehensive or effective for certain types of searches. Ultimately, the decision to use ChatGPT or another search engine will depend on the individual user's needs and preferences. What impressed me most about ChatGPT's response is that it was pretty subjective and explained its limitations.\n\nThe verdict\n\nChatGPT's value really lies in its ability to explain complicated topics as if you were talking to a human, and to do simple writing tasks. For example, I asked ChatGPT to explain concepts like the stock market and internet to me, and the responses were as if I was talking to an expert on the matter. Unlike the case on Google, I didn't have to filter through unnecessary results. I also asked it to write a letter to my landlord asking for an early end to my lease, and I'd be happy sending the results directly to my landlord, almost word for word. On the other hand, Google knows more about us and tailors the results to our interests and behaviors. Google also acts as a gateway to the internet, leading users to a plethora of different websites with more information than one could possibly digest. That's helpful if you want a range of voices, or if there's no single simple answer to your question -- like if you're looking for gift suggestions. Google is also great for certain types of questions where it scours the web to provide a brief but simple answer right in line. For instance, if you search \"Apple stock ticker\" or \"Cheap flights to Aruba,\" it will show you a ticker chart with up-to-the-minute price info, or a calendar with the most likely cheapest days to fly and a dialog box that connects you to multiple web sites to shop for tickets on your chosen date. ChatGPT does not scan the internet for real-time information, and has only been trained on data through 2021, so it's totally useless on these kinds of queries. And sometimes, ChatGPT is strangely close yet totally wrong. My editor asked it for the lyrics to \"The Ballad of Dwight Fry\" by Alice Cooper. It somehow knew the song was about a man having a mental breakdown, but then returned completely invented lyrics about that subject, rather than the actual lyrics. Google nailed it. Google is also incredibly reliable, thanks to the company's massive operations budget and years of expertise. ChatGPT is still in testing and goes down from time to time. So I'll definitely continue using Google for most of my search queries for now. But if I'm not happy with the results, now I have a useful alternative. And if I ever need to dash off an angry letter, ChatGPT could be a huge help there.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "London CNN \u2014\n\nThe global economy has endured a tough year, with decades-high inflation sapping post-lockdown spending and pushing central banks to hike borrowing costs at an unprecedented clip to bring it under control.\n\nTheir campaign to manage prices may be working \u2014 but potentially at a sizable cost in 2023.\n\n\u201cIt is likely that the world economy will face recession next year as a result of the rises in interest rates in response to higher inflation,\u201d Kay Daniel Neufeld, director and head of forecasting at the Center for Economics and Business Research, said this week.\n\nNot everyone agrees the global economy is heading for a recession. Yet with growth expected to slip even lower after a sharp slowdown in 2022, it\u2019s a possibility.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund projected in October that global growth will fall to 2.7% in 2023. Excluding the global financial crisis and the worst stage of the pandemic, that would be the weakest year for the world economy since 2001.\n\nIn November, the group warned the outlook had turned even \u201cgloomier\u201d since it published that forecast.\n\nWhether a global recession materializes may come down to three factors: what central banks do next, the consequences of China\u2019s nascent reopening and energy prices. Here\u2019s how each of these variables could dictate the year ahead.\n\nCentral banks\n\nThe IMF has called inflation \u201cthe most immediate threat to current and future prosperity.\u201d And while it\u2019s started to drop in the United States and Europe as energy prices pull back and higher interest rates feed through the economy, central banks have made clear they do not intend to stop hiking soon, even if they\u2019re more comfortable with smaller increases.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not pivoting,\u201d European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said earlier this month. \u201cWe\u2019re not wavering.\u201d\n\nCentral bankers are operating on a meeting-by-meeting basis as they parse through the latest data. They have stressed they don\u2019t know how high they\u2019ll need to raise rates, or how long they\u2019ll need to keep them there, in order to get inflation back near 2% and keep it there. If prices continue to rise by more than they\u2019d like, central banks may be more aggressive than planned, putting further pressure on the global economy.\n\n\u201cWe think that we\u2019ll have to maintain a restrictive stance of policy for some time,\u201d US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said after the central bank\u2019s December meeting.\n\nChina\n\nFor almost three years, the Chinese government has limited the spread of Covid-19 using centralized quarantines, mass testing and rigorous contact tracing. Now, following protests across the country against the stringent restrictions, it is abruptly rolling back these measures.\n\nThe imminent reopening of the world\u2019s second-largest economy could spur growth. But it also carries risks.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s current depressed state suggests that the potential for lift is large,\u201d Bruce Kasman, head of economic and policy research at JPMorgan Chase, said earlier this month. \u201cHowever, recent experience also shows that significant setbacks normally occur when openings are premature and healthcare systems are overwhelmed.\u201d\n\nA wave of coronavirus infections is currently sweeping China, but so far, Beijing is pushing ahead with plans to loosen its rules. This week, it announced it would drop quarantine requirements for international arrivals starting in early January in a major step toward reopening its borders. Other countries, meanwhile, are instating restrictions on travelers from China, fearing the development of new variants.\n\nEnergy prices\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine continues to add uncertainty to forecasts, especially for countries in Europe, which are weaning themselves off Russian energy, but could still face shortfalls.\n\nA report from the International Energy Agency found that Europe could face a natural gas shortage in 2023 if Russia cuts off all gas exports to the region and the weather turns colder.\n\nAnother wild card: The potential jump in demand for energy from China as its economy ramps back up.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re interlinked,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG. \u201cOne of the reasons energy prices are [lower] is because China is unusually weak.\u201d\n\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development indicated its latest round of economic projections could require revisions if shortages of energy supplies push prices even higher, or if governments in Europe need to enforce rationing to lower demand for gas and electricity this winter and next.\n\nWhat a global recession means\n\nWhether the world falls into recession or not, the next 12 months are likely to be difficult.\n\n\u201cIt remains a challenging backdrop,\u201d said Guillaume Menuet, Citi Private Bank\u2019s head of investment strategy and economics in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\n\nHis team predicts the world will experience the slowest economic growth in the last 40 years, aside from 2020 and the 2007-2008 financial crisis.\n\nEven if a global recession is averted, many countries could still endure downturns accompanied by painful rises in unemployment, though economists don\u2019t agree on how severe and long they might last.\n\n\u201cThe worst is yet to come, and for many people 2023 will feel like a recession,\u201d the IMF said in October, noting the slowdown \u201cwill be broad-based\u201d and may \u201creopen economic wounds that were only partially healed post-pandemic.\u201d", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The 30-year-old couple had a low credit score, few savings, and large amounts of credit card debt. Four years later, they quickly set out on their path to financial independence. \"It has been a very difficult journey,\" Tess said, \"but it's totally worth it. We have achieved so much that gives us a lot of peace.\" Price's goal is to reach a total net worth of $500,000 over the next five years. To get there, prices have to start somewhere, so they set up a plan to improve their finances. Here are three strategies to help them raise their credit scores and get out of debt. 1. Access to the budget Prices begin their financial health journey by creating a budget. They track their spending and create categories for their spending that reflect their financial priorities. \"It's a bit overwhelming at first, but it helps us better understand where our money is and where we need to make changes,\" Lee said. Prices began to focus on reducing spending and putting more of their income toward paying off debt. They realized they were overspending in some areas, such as eating out and having fun, and started cutting expenses. 2. Negotiations with creditors Once prices have identified areas of overspending, they focus on paying off debt. They call creditors to negotiate lower interest rates and payment plans. \"We have a number of creditors willing to work with us to lower interest rates,\" Li said. \"It's comforting that we know we can pay affordable amounts, and it starts releasing more money for other purposes.\" 3. Use of tools and resources Price uses a number of tools and resources for those who want to improve their financial situation. They use budget apps to track their spending, use cash refunds and incentive programs to reduce their spending, and join financial forums to gain insights from others. \"One thing that really helped us was finding a great support system, and these like-minded people went through the same struggles we faced,\" Tess said. Today, prices have paid off nearly $35,000 in debt, raised credit scores from 524 to 818, and are building wealth through investment and by-business. They're moving toward their goal of financial independence. \"It takes a lot of effort, but now we're in better financial shape and it feels good to have a plan and be able to stick with it,\" Tess said. \"We are excited to embark on this journey and can't wait to see what the future holds!\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Mastodon homepage is seen displayed on a mobile phone screen held by hand. It has been reported that more than 200.000 new users flocked the social media app after the takeover of Twitter by Elon Musk.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards\n\nLots of people are looking for a Twitter alternative after Elon Musk bought the social media site last month, changed the site's rules on impersonation, fired half of the site's staff, and announced plans to sell \"blue check\" verification badges for $8 per month. One of the fastest growing alternatives is Mastodon, which looks and feels a lot like Twitter. But Mastodon isn't a Twitter clone. It's a free open-source platform, originally launched in 2016 by developer Eugen Rochko, and it's made up of many different instances, or servers, instead of being managed by one company on one domain name. This makes signing up and finding your friends a little bit harder. There are also strange little quirks as well. Tweets are called \"toots.\" Retweets are called \"boosts.\" Because it's an open-source project, it doesn't have the same level of polish as social media sites like Twitter that are owned and operated by professionals. Emails and loading can be slow. It's a little bit like using Linux versus Windows or MacOS. Mastodon has been growing fast. In the 12 days after Musk bought Twitter, Mastodon app downloads on Apple App Store and Google Play for Android surged more than 100 times previous rates to 322,000 installs during the period, according to analysis by Sensor Tower, an app analytics firm. On Nov. 7, Mastodon founder Rochko tooted that there were over 1 million monthly active users of the service. That's still a lot lower than the over 245 million daily active users of Twitter that CEO Elon Musk tweeted about this week. Here's what you need to know about Mastodon:\n\nFirst, you need to pick a server, or instance\n\nMastodon homepage is seen displayed on a mobile phone screen held by hand. It has been reported that more than 200.000 new users flocked the social media app after the takeover of Twitter by Elon Musk. Davide Bonaldo | Lightrocket | Getty Images\n\nBecause anyone can set up their own Mastodon server, there's no central place to sign up like twitter.com. You have to find a server to sign up for. They're known as \"instances,\" and you can think of them like e-mail providers. A user on one instance can interact with users on other instances, including following, replying, and boosting. All instances taken together are called \"the fediverse.\" (The term comes from \"federated,\" which refers to the loosely connected way the servers work together \u2014 again, similar to email.) Each instance has its own URL, which comes after your username, sort of like an email domain. There are over 5,000 instances, according to a site tracking Mastodon use, and they often follow a particular theme, such as geographical region or topic. Some require you to fill out a short application form with information like your interests or why you want to join that instance. Some servers are small and only for a small handful of friends. There's even a quiz that you can take to find which instance might be right for you. The most popular instance is mastodon.online, which is also administered by the service's founder. Bigger instances mean many of the best or shortest usernames on the server have already been taken. There's also a list of instances you can join on Mastodon's website. Unlike Twitter, many of the instances that Mastodon runs on are not-for-profit, and some raise money for server costs and other expenses on sites like Patreon. It's possible that some instances could stop operating because their administrators lose interest. All instances have a feed just for people on that server that shows all toots posted in that instance in chronological order. But you can also just look at your personalized feed, which shows only toots from the people you follow \u2014 that's the experience that's most like Twitter.\n\nYour username includes your server's name\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards\n\nFollowing isn't as simple as it is on Twitter. If you want to follow someone on the same instance as you, press the plus button next to their username. But if they're on a different instance than you, it's best to copy and paste their entire username into Mastodon's search box\u2014 including the part after the second \"@\" symbol that denotes which server they are on. For example: @Gargron@mastodon.social is how to follow the CEO of Mastodon. Users who are not on Mastodon.Social need to copy and paste that entire string into their search box. You can follow me at the address @kif@cybervillians.com. There's no verification on Mastodon, and DMs are viewable by the instance administrator. Content moderation is also up to the instance administrator \u2014 Mastodon.Social, for example, bans Nazi imagery. Other servers may have looser rules.\n\nHow to find friends\n\nMastodon can be a bit of a ghost town when you first log on, but there are a few ways to find your old favorite tweeters on the platform. Whether they post a lot is a different question. One of the easiest ways to find people to follow is to search \"Mastodon\" on Twitter, where people who have created new accounts often post their new handles. Copy and paste it into the Mastodon search box to follow them.\n\nYou can also copy and paste your Mastodon handle \u2014 with the @ symbol and domain \u2014 into your Twitter account to get your existing followers to try to join you. There are several directories that list interesting people to follow on Mastodon. If you'd like to try to follow the same people on Mastodon as you did on Twitter, there are several third-party apps that will try to import your follow list, although they require access to your Twitter account -- be aware that you're giving that information away to a third party.\n\nGet tootin'", "label": "human"}
{"text": "(Reuters) - Iranian chess master Dorsa Derakhshani was warned not to return to Iran after participating in the trade Gibraltar Chess Festival competition without wearing a head scarf, a source close to his family said on Saturday. The 22-year-old woman made headlines in 2017 when she attended the Trade Gibraltar Chess Festival without wearing a headscarf, in violation of a ban imposed by Iranian authorities in 2017 that required women to cover their hair when they went out. At the time, she was immediately removed from the national team and told to go home, although she chose to stay in Europe. Draghisani is now stationed in Spain and has been competing in the Spanish League for the past two years. The unnamed source said Drahsani had recently returned to Tehran to visit her family, but was warned by officials not to return. The source added that Drahsani received numerous threats from Iranian officials warning her not to continue her professional chess career without a head scarf. \"Dossa is very scared,\" the source said, \"the government has been extremely upset by her decision not to wear a headscarf and they have warned her not to return to Iran or she will face severe punishment.\" Drahshani's case has been widely condemned by human rights groups and international chess players around the world, who have called for her to be allowed to continue her career in Iran. The tournament's governing body, the World Chess Federation (FIDE), has also criticized Iran for \"unreasonable treatment\" of Drahsani and called on the Iranian government to end discrimination against female chess players. In response, the Iranian Chess Federation denied Derakhshani's claims and said she had never been sanctioned for not having a head scarf. However, the source said that Derakhshani and her family were still threatened by authorities. \"Dossa was very scared and she was explicitly warned not to come back,\" the source said, adding: \"So far, she has been following orders. Derakhshani is one of many Iranian women who have been targeted by authorities for challenging the country's traditional gender norms. Last December, Iranian actress Sadaf Taherian was sentenced to one year in prison and 90 flogging for her public appearance without a head scarf. Last November, a group of young Iranian women were arrested for dancing in videos posted on Instagram. The Iranian authorities claim that Islamic dress codes are necessary to protect the country's culture and morality. But the hardliners' restrictive regulations have met with growing resistance and protests from a generation of young Iranians who are increasingly opposed to authorities trying to control their behavior and appearance. Sources said the Drahshani family felt increasingly vulnerable and did not know what would happen next. \"We are all very concerned,\" the source said, \"that Dossa's situation is a very sad example of the Iranian government's attempts to control the behavior of its citizens.\"", "label": "machine"}

A resolution to the Russia-Ukraine conflict would also remove the war-related risk premium from energy costs, causing prices to fall.\n\nThe crude benchmark currently trades at just over $80 a barrel, so a slide to $40 would mean a 50% decline.\n\nThe convergence of a global recession, continued zero-COVID lockdowns in China and a ceasefire in Ukraine would unleash the \"perfect storm\" for oil markets, sparking outsized declines in prices, according to the bank.\n\n\"China experiences a surge in COVID cases, leading to nationwide lockdowns and significantly delaying its economic reopening,\" Robertson's team said, describing the surprise scenario. \"The global recession spreads, with even previously resilient economies succumbing to a protracted decline in consumer and business demand.\"\n\n\"The decline in oil prices is exacerbated by the end of the military conflict in Ukraine,\" the strategists added. \"With oil prices falling quickly, Russia is unable to fund its military activities and agrees to a ceasefire. The end of the war causes the risk premium that had supported energy prices to disappear completely.\"\n\nCryptocurrencies could suffer again in 2023, with one of Standard Chartered's upsets seeing bitcoin fall a further 70% to just $5,000 \u2013 with the largest token by market capitalization already losing 64% of its value this year.\n\nThe spectacular collapse of the FTX exchange last month could trigger a further rout for digital assets that could otherwise be supported by central bank pivots, according to the bank.\n\nHere are five other potential upsets Standard Chartered said could shock markets in 2023:", "label": "human"}
{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nBroadway babies, we\u2019ve reached that spectacular segment of the theatrical season in which musicals and plays open in droves and vie for a chance to win a Tony Award \u2013 or 11.\n\nThere are tigers and murderous barbers and cookouts and corn-centric fables opening on Broadway this year, and those are just the ones that will open early enough to be considered for a 2023 Tony. Later in the year, the music of Britney Spears gets its due and a DeLorean will delight fans of a certain \u201980s franchise.\n\nAll that to say, we devotees of the stage are in for several theatrical treats this year. Here are a few of the musicals and plays set to premiere in 2023 that already have Broadway fans buzzing.\n\nFamiliar IP, new medium\n\n\u2018Life of Pi\u2019\n\nHiran Abeysekera (left) performs alonside the several puppeteers who power Richard Parker the Bengal Tiger at the 2022 Olivier Awards. Jeff Spicer/Getty Images\n\nYann Martel\u2019s beloved novel gets the theatrical treatment this spring, and it continues the new Broadway tradition cemented by \u201cInto the Woods\u201d of an animal puppet stealing the show out from under its human co-stars. How will Pi\u2019s sea-set journey with Richard Parker the Bengal tiger translate on stage? If its London reviews are to be believed, it works effortlessly.\n\nPerformances begin: March 9\n\nOfficially opens: March 30\n\nWho knew? It took seven people to bring the Richard Parker puppet to vivid life in the West End production, all of whom shared the Olivier Award for best actor in a supporting role. There are actors crouched underneath his spine and head who walk for him, another who provides his voice and more who control his limbs and tail.\n\n\u2018Back to the Future: The Musical\u2019\n\nThe DeLorean featured in \"Back to the Future: The Musical\" was on display during New York Comic Con 2022. Roy Rochlin/Getty Images\n\nDoc Brown\u2019s DeLorean is careening onto Broadway this summer. A hit in London\u2019s West End, \u201cBack to the Future: The Musical\u201d promises sci-fi spectacle, \u201980s nostalgia and attempted unintentional incest. The musical retains all the signature moments from the original movie, from Biff\u2019s bullying to Marty\u2019s \u201cJohnny B. Goode\u201d performance, but jazzes them up with extended dance sequences and soaring solos.\n\nPerformances begin: June 30\n\nOfficially opens: August 3\n\nWho knew? The DeLorean seen onstage in the British production isn\u2019t a real vehicle \u2013 less than 10,000 DeLorean cars were ever made, so the musical\u2019s crew painstakingly recreated one for the production. As for what it\u2019s capable of onstage\u2026 well, we\u2019ll let audiences discover those delights for themselves.\n\nBold new musicals and revivals\n\n\u2018Bad Cinderella\u2019\n\nThere is an unofficial rule in musical theater that Andrew Lloyd Webber must always have a show running on Broadway. And when his long-running musical \u201cPhantom of the Opera\u201d closes later this year, his new spin on Cindy\u2019s rags-to-royalty tale will carry the mantle. Webber\u2019s new version of \u201cCinderella,\u201d with a book by Emerald Fennell (\u201cPromising Young Woman,\u201d \u201cKilling Eve\u201d), paints our protagonist not as a faultless princess-to-be but as a grungy and headstrong heroine.\n\nPerformances begin: February 17\n\nOfficially opens: March 23\n\nWho knew? Webber ruffled feathers this summer when he called the London production a \u201ccostly mistake\u201d in a letter the West End cast read aloud after their final performance. (Webber opted to forgo an in-person appearance at the show.) His letter earned him boos in absentia, for which he later apologized.\n\n\u2018Sweeney Todd\u2019\n\nIf you can, attend the tale of Josh Groban-as-Sweeney Todd. One of the late Stephen Sondheim\u2019s darkest works (and that\u2019s saying something), this revival follows the \u201cDemon Barber of Fleet Street,\u201d his lovesick and deranged assistant, a pair of innocent lovers and an evil judge who lords over them all. Expect spilled blood and turned stomachs, especially if you get a whiff of one of Mrs. Lovett\u2019s meat pies.\n\nPerformances begin: February 26\n\nOfficially opens: March 26\n\nWho knew? This production stars a number of TV stars, including Gaten Matarazzo (the lovable Dustin from \u201cStranger Things\u201d), Annaleigh Ashford (Paula Jones in \u201cAmerican Crime Story: Impeachment\u201d) and Jordan Fisher (various Disney Channel series and Netflix originals), though Ashford outnumbers them all in Broadway credits.\n\n\u2018Shucked\u2019\n\nThis new country-tinged musical invites audiences to embrace their inner \u201cCorn Kid.\u201d Yep, the title is a reference to the process by which corn husks are stripped from cobs, though the show\u2019s vague description promises to provide a \u201ckernel of hope for our divided nation.\u201d\n\nPerformances begin: March 8\n\nOfficially opens: April 4\n\nWho knew?

When \u201cFat Ham\u201d begins previews, it\u2019ll be one of two Pulitzer winners on Broadway (the other is the indomitable hit \u201cHamilton\u201d). Another Pulitzer Prize-winning play, \u201cBetween Riverside and Crazy,\u201d is scheduled to close in February, and the musical \u201cA Strange Loop,\u201d which also won a Pulitzer, will close this month.\n\n\u2018A Doll\u2019s House\u2019\n\nJessica Chastain stars in this new adaptation of Henrik Ibsen\u2019s landmark play about a wife and mother whose delicate existence begins to crack under the weight of societal expectations.

{"text": "The city of Chicago has delayed the opening of a new southern shelter for asylum seekers due to strong opposition from local residents and elderly Leslie Hairston. The shelter, originally intended to provide temporary housing and services for asylum seekers, was scheduled to open this month but has been delayed due to a lack of community approval. \"We understand the concerns of the community and we have decided to delay the opening of shelters until a solution is reached,\" Ald.Gearston said in a statement. \"The city has been working with local stakeholders over the past few months to ensure that the interests of all participants are taken into account.\" The city initially planned to open a shelter on the site of an abandoned church near the South Bank, but local residents and Ald.Gearston expressed concern about the location. Residents are also concerned about the influx of asylum seekers and its potential impact on local housing markets and public safety, while others are concerned about possible conflicts between asylum seekers and local communities. The city has proposed several new locations for shelters and asked residents and the elderly to provide additional feedback. \"We are currently researching a number of new locations and continue to engage in dialogue with local communities to better understand their concerns,\" the city's spokesman said. To address these issues, Ald.Gearston has been working to ensure that the needs of both local communities and asylum seekers are taken into account. \"We want to ensure that everyone's rights and needs are respected, and all parties involved feel safe and inclusive,\" said Ald Gearston. The city said it would continue to work with local communities and stakeholders to reach a resolution and develop the best course of action for all involved. The delay in opening the South Side Shelter has come as the Trump administration dramatically cuts down on the ability of asylum seekers to seek asylum in the United States, with the number of asylum applications accepted falling to an all-time low in 2020. As the city strives to determine the best way forward for a shelter on the south side, both local residents and asylum seekers are watching this process closely. \"We will continue to work with the local community to reach a solution that is in the best interests of all involved,\" said Ald.Gearston.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "As we enter a new year, impact marketing and the creator economy will usher in another exciting year of growth and transformation. In 2020, the popularity of influence marketing and the creator economy has increased unprecedentedly as many people around the world turned to social media to stay connected during a pandemic. From TikTok to Twitch to podcasts, creators have found novel ways to interact with their fans, while companies are increasingly adopting influencer marketing strategies. Looking ahead to 2023, industry insiders are forecasting some of the major trends that could impact influence and creator markets. From new platforms and technologies to audience engagement, there are five key trends to watch this year. 1. Increased focus on authenticity This means that creators need to be more aware of how their content is perceived and how it aligns with individual brands. Companies and influencers need to focus more on creating authentic content that resonates with their target audiences. The rise of \"micro-impactors\" As a result, companies are increasingly turning to micro-influencers to help promote their products and services. As micro-impactors become more popular, larger influencers may differentiate themselves through exclusive content and experiences. 3.Increased value of personal brand construction As platforms like Instagram and YouTube continue to evolve, the ability to stand out from the competition will become more important than ever. Creators need to focus on creating unique and authentic content that resonates with their target audiences, which can include creating videos and podcasts, interacting with fans on social media, and developing a comprehensive brand strategy. Enhance the integration of AR and VR technologies Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are becoming increasingly popular in the realm of influencers and creators. These technologies are being used to create immersive, engaging experiences for audiences, and can be used to extend content to new platforms and audiences. In 2023, we may see more influential people and creators integrating these technologies into their content and strategies as they look to further engage with fans and reach new audiences. 5. Growing demand for remunerated cooperation In 2023, we may see more influencers and creators turning to paid collaborations to monetize their content. Brands and influencers have begun to recognize the potential of working together in paid partnerships, and this is likely to become increasingly common this year. Companies and creators need to be proactive in staying ahead of the curve and adapting to changing environments. By keeping a close eye on these five trends, companies and influencers can ensure they remain at the forefront of their industry in 2023.", "label": "machine"}

Battleships\n\nOnce thought to be the cornerstone of naval power, the advent of naval aviation and the rise of the aircraft carrier in WWII was the beginning of the end for the large-gunned ships of the line.\n\nThough battleships saw continuous combat in WWII and Korea, the US Navy was left without an active battleship upon the decommissioning of the USS Wisconsin in March 1958; the first time since 1895.\n\nMost military enthusiasts are familiar with the Reagan administration's 600-ship Navy and the reactivation of the battleships USS Iowa, Missouri, New Jersey and Wisconsin.\n\nUSS Wisconsin firing its 16-inch guns during the Korean War. US Navy\n\nUSS New Jersey would be the first to fire her massive 16-inch guns at enemy targets again during the Lebanese Civil War from 1983-1984.\n\nUSS Missouri and Wisconsin would return to combat in 1991 during the Gulf War. However, USS New Jersey was brought back into active service once before.\n\nFollowing the beginning of Operation Rolling Thunder in 1965, the loss of US aircraft over Vietnam increased exponentially.\n\nThe planes that took part in the sustained aerial bombardment campaign were exceptionally vulnerable to sophisticated Soviet-made surface-to-air weapon systems provided to the North Vietnamese.\n\nUSS Missouri fires a Tomahawk cruise missile at an Iraqi target in January 1991. US Navy\n\nIn an effort to alleviate these air losses while still delivering ordnance payloads, USS New Jersey was brought out of mothballs in April 1968 and modernized for active service in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe only active battleship in the world, New Jersey joined the gun line off the Vietnamese coast on September 25.\n\nFive days later, she fired her first shots in over 16 years during an engagement against PAVN targets near the DMZ at the 17th parallel. She would go on to fire 14,891 5-inch shells and 5,688 16-inch shells during the war in support of ARVN, US and even Korean troops.\n\n2. M14 rifle\n\nUS troops with the M14 Enhanced Battle Rifle. US Army\n\nAn evolution of the famed M1 Garand of WWII and Korea, the M14 battle rifle became the standard-issue rifle for the US military in 1959.\n\nFiring the 7.62 x 51 mm NATO round, the M14 was meant to streamline logistics efforts by replacing the M1 Garand, M1903 Springfield, M1917 Enfield, M1 carbine, M3 submachine gun, M1928/M1 Thompson submachine gun, and M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle.\n\nWhile the M14 exhibited outstanding accuracy and stopping power in its semi-automatic setting, its full-power cartridge was deemed too powerful for the submachine gun role and its light weight made it difficult to control during automatic fire as a light machine gun.\n\nAn infantry marksman provides security in the Spin Boldak district of Afghanistan in July 2012. US Army\n\nThough the M14 was replaced by the M16 as the standard-issue rifle in 1968, it found a new role as a precision rifle platform. It served as the basis of the M21 Sniper Weapon System introduced in 1968 and M25 Sniper Weapon System introduced in 1991.\n\nThough both weapon systems have been largely replaced by the M24 Sniper Weapon System, the M14 lives on as the Mk14 Enhanced Battle Rifle. Introduced in 2002, the Mk14 is a truer reincarnation of the M14.\n\nWhere the M21 and M25 were restricted to semi-automatic fire, designated as Sniper Weapon Systems and saw more restricted issuance as a result, the Mk14 sees the return of selective fire, the designation as a battle rifle for both designated marksman and close combat roles, and issuance by the Army to two riflemen per infantry platoon deploying to Afghanistan.\n\n3. Guns on fighter planes\n\nAn F-35A uses its 25 mm cannon during training in Utah in August 2018. US Air Force/Todd Cromar\n\nWith the advent of radar-guided and heat-seeking air-to-air missiles, like the AIM-7 Sparrow and AIM-9 Sidewinder, and the new threat of high-altitude, long-range Soviet bombers, US air-combat doctrine called for the elimination of gun armament on fighter-interceptor aircraft.\n\nThough dedicated attack and fighter aircraft like the A-4 Skyhawk, A-7 Corsair II and the F-8 Crusader retained 20mm cannons for ground attack and close-range aerial combat, interceptors like the F-86D Sabre, F-102 Delta Dagger and the F-4 Phantom II dispensed with any type of gun armament in favor of rockets and missiles.\n\nThe idea during the late '50s and early '60s was that these types of aircraft would engage in long-range combat without visual contact of their target and even if they did get close enough to see the enemy that the new Sidewinder missile would be able to dispense with a hostile fighter with ease.\n\nA US airman inspects an M61A1 Vulcan cannon on an F-16 at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska in March.

According to the US Naval Institute, the Navy's kill ratio in Vietnam was just 2.5:1. The drop in kill ratio was attributed to poor missile accuracy at just 10% and lack of dogfighting skills.\n\nThe latter resulted in the creation of TOPGUN while the former resulted in the addition of an external gun pod to the Phantom II.

{"text": "Graham Cochrane, Founder of The Recording Revolution, started his business in 2009 during The Great Recession.\n\nWhen starting a business, it's sometimes hard to know what to prioritize, and going at it alone can be overwhelming. But there are strategies you can use to avoid common pitfalls. My mission is to teach people how to earn money from their passions. It's what I did: I went from living on food stamps to building two online businesses. Today, I run a music blog, The Recording Revolution, and a entrepreneurship coaching company. I work just five hours a week from my home office and make $160,000 a month in passive income. Here's what I tell my 3,000 clients to think about in the first 30 days of starting a business:\n\n1. Be clear about how you want to spend your time.\n\nMany new business owners I meet know only one thing: how much money they want to make. While that's a great starting point, it's incomplete. Your business should serve your life, not the other way around. So make sure it aligns with your hopes, dreams and goals. To get clear about the type of business and life you want, ask three questions: What does a perfect day look like to you? Don't just think about your typical workday. Consider other life activities you want to fit into your day, like exercising or spending time with family. How many hours do you want to work a week? You don't have to follow the standard 40-hour workweek. Knowing exactly how many hours you want to work will help you better prioritize tasks. How important is time off? Some people don't care much about taking time off, as long as they love what they do. Others value extended time off. In order to have money flowing in when you're not working, you'll need to have some sort of passive income stream.\n\n2. Simplify your business model.\n\nWhen I started my music education business, people told me I needed to test my sales pages, throw launch parties and pre-record a bunch of ads in order to grow. Rather than stretching myself thin doing things that didn't make sense to me, I kept it simple and focused on three things: creating weekly content for my blog and YouTube channel, growing my email list from that audience, and promoting the paid products I created to that list. If you're just starting out, develop content around your expertise to grow an audience. It doesn't have to be perfect. You can iterate as you go and design new products based on what your customers want more of.\n\n3. Cut out unnecessary daily tasks.\n\nIdentify what daily activities will help you earn more. Don't waste time or burn yourself out focusing on unimportant tasks. It might feel good to get to inbox zero or change the color of the buttons on your website, especially in the early days where you want to feel like you've achieved a goal. But neither of those things will make you money. Before you start a new task, ask yourself three questions: What's the expected outcome for doing this task? Does it lead to more money? Can I point to a direct link between doing that task and earning income? What's the cost of doing this instead of something else?\n\n4. Prioritize having fun.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Illustration: Benjamin Currie/HuffPost; Photo: Getty Thirty-nine percent of American Jews have changed their behavior out of fear of antisemitism, according to a 2021 report by the American Jewish Committee.\n\nFor American Jews, the threat of antisemitism has become increasingly worrisome over the last few years.\n\nThough they make up less than 3% of the U.S. population, Jews are disproportionately targeted in hate crimes in America. Last year, 1 in 4 American Jews said they had experienced antisemitism in some form, according to a survey by the American Jewish Committee. Meanwhile, one-third of Jewish students experienced antisemitism on college campuses in 2021, according to a study by the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThirty-nine percent of American Jews have changed their behavior out of fear of antisemitism, according to a 2021 report by the American Jewish Committee. This includes not publicly identifying as a Jew, avoiding carrying or wearing markers that would identify them as Jewish, avoiding places or events for safety reasons and avoiding posting online content that identifies them as Jewish.\n\nSo much of this fear can be attributed to the normalization of anti-Jewish rhetoric and conspiratorial discourse in public life: Republican candidates, NBA stars including Kyrie Irving and rappers such as Ye have all floated conspiracy theories about Jews with relative impunity.\n\nIn the case of Ye (formerly known as Kanye West), he has praised Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. While appearing earlier this month on right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones\u2019 Infowars show, the rapper and designer said he \u201cloves\u201d Nazis and that the \u201cthe Jewish media has made us feel like the Nazis and Hitler have never offered anything of value to the world.\u201d\n\nDiscourse like this doesn\u2019t just end in antisemitic memes being spread on Twitter. (Though it encourages that, too; antisemitic posts referring to Jews or Judaism have soared more than 61% in the two weeks since Elon Musk acquired the site.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s much more dangerous than memes, said Beth Kean, the CEO of the Holocaust Museum LA.\n\n\u201cThese celebrities are furthering Holocaust denial and emboldening right-wing extremist groups who now feel empowered to express their hate in broad daylight,\u201d Kean said. \u201cWe see this in everything from antisemitic flyers littering lawns and cars in neighborhoods nationwide to large public displays with swastikas on the 405 Freeway in Los Angeles, a cemetery in Chicago and a stadium in Jacksonville.\u201d\n\nToday on the 405 in Los Angeles. We are waiting @adidas. pic.twitter.com/C39gLLu4Wb \u2014 Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) October 23, 2022\n\nThis rise in antisemitic rhetoric comes just four years after a Pittsburgh synagogue attack that left 11 Jewish people dead \u2015 the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history.\n\nThose who espouse such views seem to disregard the potentially violent effect their words may have on others, Kean said. The Holocaust started with just words, she noted.\n\n\u201cWe know what can happen when hatred and bigotry go unchecked,\u201d she said. \u201cMy grandmother was a Holocaust survivor. She watched her parents and siblings walk into the gas chambers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeremy Burton, the CEO of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Boston, told HuffPost that all Americans need to recognize that antisemitism is not just a Jewish problem to fight; it\u2019s everyone\u2019s problem.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep living our lives and building vibrant Jewish communities, but antisemitism is a virus that infects our society,\u201d Burton said. \u201cAn America where Jews can no longer live freely without fear is not the America that any decent person should want to be part of.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake antisemitism your problem to fight,\u201d he added. \u201cDon\u2019t look away.\u201d\n\nWhat does taking a stand look like? Below, experts share six ways to help combat antisemitism and be a better ally to the Jewish community.\n\nDon\u2019t normalize antisemitism.\n\nFor Burton, the most deeply trouble part of this moment is how antisemitism is being normalized by so-called legitimate actors. Anti-Jewish statements that a few years ago would have been unutterable are all over our social media and television screens.\n\n\u201cThere have been neo-Nazis out there for decades, but now they are having dinner with a former president,\u201d he told HuffPost, referring to Donald Trump\u2019s dinner at Mar-a-Lago last month with Ye and white nationalist Nick Fuentes. \u201cAnd it isn\u2019t just that a celebrity tweets a swastika but that tens of thousands of other people then \u2018like\u2019 and retweet that post within hours.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConscientious people have taken notice to some extent, Burton said, but more can be done.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think people have fully wrapped their minds around how much is changing, how fast and how dangerous it is,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they did, I\u2019d like to believe that there\u2019d be more wall-to-wall outrage than we\u2019re seeing right now.\u201d\n\nReport antisemitism and call out discrimination.\n\nIf you experience or witness an act of antisemitism, extremism, bigotry or hate, report it to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). If it\u2019s an emergency, first call 911.\n\n\u201cPublic reports enable ADL to gather information needed to educate lawmakers and law enforcement and to advocate for individuals and groups that are targeted because of their religion, race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, origin or level of ability,\u201d Kean explained.\n\nReport antisemitic posts on social media, too, she said, and put pressure on business leaders who are profiting off of hate and antisemitic materials (for instance, books that promote Holocaust denial on Amazon) and promoting hate speech.\n\nIf you hear someone say something antisemitic even in passing, be courageous and say something back. If it comes from someone you know, engage them and figure out if it is coming from ignorance or genuine hate, said Carly F. Gammill, the director of the StandWithUs Center for Combating Antisemitism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTry educating them calmly about why their words or actions are offensive,\u201d she said.\n\nCatherine Falls Commercial via Getty Images If you see antisemitic remarks on social media, call them out and report them.\n\nDon\u2019t just think, \u201cI already knows what antisemitism is.\u201d Dig deeper to understand the roots of antisemitism and the Holocaust.\n\nRabbi Isaiah Rothstein, a rabbinic scholar and public affairs adviser at the Jewish Federation of North America, thinks that many Americans are misinformed about Jewish history and misunderstand who the Jewish people are.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t always listen to how we define ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are a multiracial, multiethnic and multicultural people whose families come from more than 70 countries around the world. We need to be students of each other\u2019s past so we can drive towards a better future that works for all peoples.\u201d\n\nRothstein recommends reading books like Paul Johnson\u2019s \u201cHistory of the Jews\u201d and Deborah Lipstadt\u2019s \u201cAntisemitism Here and Now.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo further your understanding, visit a museum or education center near you to learn about how what started with \u201cjust words\u201d led to the systematic mass murder of 6 million Jews and millions of others, including LGBTQ individuals and people with disabilities.\n\n\u201cEach day at our Holocaust museum, we teach the critical lessons and social relevancy of the Holocaust and other genocides to empower students and the public to stand up against hatred, bigotry and antisemitism,\u201d said Kean, the CEO of the Los Angeles Holocaust museum.\n\nMany of these institutions also offer opportunities to meet and talk with a Holocaust survivor to learn from a firsthand witness.\n\nNot sure where to go?

As part of their visit, they heard from a 99-year-old survivor of the Holocaust.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t let antisemitism become a partisan issue. (And don\u2019t assume antisemitism is only perpetrated by white supremacists).\n\nDon\u2019t allow antisemitism to be turned into yet another partisan issue, Burton said.\n\n\u201cThe fight against antisemitism should not be weaponized for partisan advantage,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t be a conservative who only calls out antisemitism on the left, or a progressive who only calls it out on the right.\u201d\n\nTake the time to learn and understand how antisemitism may show up in your own circles, and call it out there. \u201cIt may be a little more uncomfortable to do so, but that\u2019s where you can make the greatest difference,\u201d he said.\n\nAntisemitism can be perpetuated by anyone, not just white supremacists.\n\n\u201cThere is a misconception that antisemitism only comes from neo-Nazis and white supremacists,\u201d Rothstein said. \u201cWhile these ideologies are, of course, steeped in antisemitism, the last 60 years have seen a dramatic increase of antisemitism across the political spectrum, from the far right to the far left.\u201d\n\nBy typecasting all antisemites as white supremacists, antisemitism \u2015 which is present in nearly all spaces, communities and movements \u2015 can too easily be dismissed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis limits our ability to identify, mitigate and course correct,\u201d the rabbi said.\n\nIra L. Black/Corbis via Getty Images Marchers protesting antisemitism cross the Brooklyn Bridge on Jan. 2, 2020, in New York City as part of the No Hate No Fear Solidarity March.\n\nEncourage your workplace to include antisemitism education in its DEI program.\n\nBecause many people don\u2019t understand or recognize anti-Jewish biases, Jewish people in the workplace often experience microaggressions, invalidations, assaults and outright discrimination, Rothstein said.\n\n\u201cFor instance, many don\u2019t realize that religion is only one organizing aspect of the Jewish people,\u201d he said. \u201cJews encompass all races and ethnicities, and many hold transgenerational trauma from decades of systemic genocide, persecution and discrimination.\u201d\n\nBecause there\u2019s so much nuance and outside confusion about the Jewish community, consider pushing to include more on the Jewish American experience in your company\u2019s training on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).\n\n\u201cTraining and initiatives to increase awareness of antisemitism as a DEI issue would significantly reduce antisemitism, especially if the lessons were centered as a critical inclusion and belonging issue,\u201d the rabbi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJasmin Merdan via Getty Images Rabbi Isaiah Rothstein thinks training and initiatives to increase awareness of antisemitism as a workplace issue of diversity, equity and inclusion would significantly reduce antisemitism.\n\nTeach your kids about antisemitism, too.\n\nA national survey conducted by the ADL in 2020 showed that students who get Holocaust education in high school are more empathetic, tolerant and open-minded.\n\n\u201cEducators need to teach and facilitate age-appropriate discussions in their classrooms on how to address racism, bigotry and hatred, and legislators must prioritize anti-hate programs in schools,\u201d Kean said.\n\nIn California, for instance, Gov. Gavin Newsom launched the Governor\u2019s Council on Holocaust and Genocide Education to promote Holocaust and genocide education with the mission to provide students with the tools necessary to recognize and respond to bigotry and discrimination.\n\nIf you are a parent or grandparent, there\u2019s room to educate, too. Maybe you talk to your kids about Ye\u2019s recent comments and use it as an opening to discuss antisemitism and other forms of bias.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you plan to visit a Holocaust museum or Jewish education center, bring the kids along.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "America needs carpenters and plumbers. Try telling that to Gen Z\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption David Zalubowski/AP David Zalubowski/AP\n\nJustin Mwandjalulu, 20, loves to build stuff.\n\nThese days, as a carpentry apprentice, he installs drywall in houses with the rest of his construction crew. But he said he likes concrete the best.\n\n\"At the end of the day, you see how you poured everything. The result of your hard work,\" he said.\n\nMwandjalulu dreamed of becoming a carpenter or electrician as a child. And now he's fulfilling that dream. But that also makes him an exception to the rule. While Gen Z \u2014 often described as people born between 1997 and 2012 \u2014 is on track to become the most educated generation, fewer young folks are opting for traditionally hands-on jobs in the skilled trade and technical industries.\n\nGen Z interest in trades and skilled work has dropped\n\nThe number of young people seeking technical jobs \u2014 like plumbing, building and electrical work \u2014 dropped by 49% in 2022 compared to 2020, according to data from online recruiting platform Handshake shared with NPR.\n\nResearchers from Handshake tracked how the number of applications for technical roles vs. the number of job postings has changed over the last two years.\n\nWhile postings for those roles \u2014 automotive technicians, equipment installers and respiratory therapists, to name a few \u2014 saw about 10 applications each in 2020, they got about five per posting in 2022.\n\nThe typical rate is about 19 applications per job on Handshake, according to Christine Cruzvergara, the company's chief education strategy officer.\n\nWhile the creation of technical positions has continued to grow, the number of students interested in applying for them \u2014 hasn't.\n\nOccupations such as auto technician with aging workforces have the U.S. Chamber of Commerce warning of a \"massive\" shortage of skilled workers in 2023.\n\n\"For a long time, our society has not talked favorably about the skilled trades,\" said Cruzvergara. \"We've instead encouraged students to all go to college, all go to four-year institutions, graduate, go out into white collar jobs.\"\n\nOne path does not fit all\n\nMwandjalulu, who lives in Iowa City, Iowa and is in his second year of a four-year carpentry apprenticeship, found school difficult.\n\nHe immigrated with his family to the United States from Benin, Africa, when he was a freshman.\n\n\"Man, it was hard,\" he said. While his twin brother, now studying to work in banking, excelled, Mwandjalulu said he struggled with writing and English.\n\n\"I'm not the type of guy that likes being in the same spot all day long, dealing with papers and stuff,\" he said.\n\nAround high school graduation, Mwandjalulu said he got depressed because he didn't know what he wanted to do with his life. Many of his older friends who went to college and graduated were struggling to find jobs.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Justin Mwandjalulu Justin Mwandjalulu\n\n\"I didn't want to look like them,\" he said. \"I didn't want to just spend money and have a lot of loans and not use my papers,\" he said, referring to a degree and a diploma.\n\nAccording to the Department of Education, about 45 million people in the United States owe nearly $1.3 trillion in student debt.\n\nBut Mwandjalulu, who makes nearly $24 an hour as a carpenter, said he's still had trouble convincing his friends, whom he keeps in touch with on Facebook and Snapchat, to follow his path.\n\n\"There's not a lot of people, especially immigrants, that think outside of school,\" he said.\n\nThe narrative is shifting\n\nPaul Iversen, a labor educator with University of Iowa's Labor Center, hopes to change that.\n\nIversen, who helps helps run a pre-apprenticeship program, said one of the reasons participation in the skilled trades is low among Gen Z is because the work was once typically passed down in families.\n\n\"It used to be word-of-mouth,\" said Iversen. \"But there's more of a need for carpenters, pipefitters, plumbers and electricians than you can fill with the family members of current people.\"\n\nThat reality is hitting home for farmer John Boyd Jr.\n\nBoyd, 57, owns a 300-acre farm in Virginia where he grows soybeans, corn and wheat and raises cattle \u2014 just as three generations did before him. But now, none of his three children want to take over when he retires.\n\n\"Everybody on my farm is over the age of 50,\" said Boyd, who is the president of the National Black Farmers' Association. \"We need some young people with some energy and hustle and innovation.\"\n\nMichael Coleman, 28, is one of them. He received a scholarship from the NBFA in 2015 to study animal science at the University of Nebraska.\n\nColeman is now an animal health technician with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and dreams of one day owning his own farm. But, at times, he's found it a lonely field.\n\nThe average age of a U.S. farmer is 57.5, according to the 2017 US Agriculture Census, up from 54.9 in 2007, and Coleman said he's only met a couple other farmers around his age.\n\n\"We kind of stick together,\" he said.\n\nThere is plenty of need\n\nBut Coleman said he's seen more young people express interest in agribusiness and other technical industries, particularly after the pandemic.\n\n\"Especially with student loans and everything, it's a lot cheaper to get a trade and make a lot of money,\" said Coleman. Most young folks just haven't had people show them the ropes,\" he said.\n\nStill, filling trade and technical jobs takes active recruitment, said Iversen, who pays frequent visits to high schools around Iowa City and works with school counselors to place students in the pre-apprenticeship program.\n\nNow especially, there's an urgency to fill open posts, said Iversen, as the federal government funnels billions into projects to upgrade roads and transit systems across the country.\n\n\"We have to recruit people to do these things or else our bridges are going to fall apart,\" Iversen said.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nScoot over, Facebook and Instagram.\n\nThere\u2019s a newer photo-sharing app \u2013 and it\u2019s not like other social media platforms.\n\nThe app is called BeReal. And while you may not have heard of it, a lot of young people are signing up. Its active monthly users have skyrocketed this year by more than 315%, according to data from Apptopia, which tracks and analyzes performance.\n\nWe joined the app and talked to users to get a deeper understanding of how BeReal works and what you need to know about it.\n\nSo, what\u2019s BeReal?\n\nBeReal is a social media app that encourages users to share a slice of their life in real time. It was launched in early 2020 by an entrepreneur in France but a majority of its users \u2013 at least 65% \u2013 have signed up this calendar year.\n\nAs its name suggests, the focus is on authenticity. Users are invited once a day to share a photo of what they\u2019re doing at that moment, giving friends and others an unvarnished glimpse into their life.\n\nIt has no filters and no edit buttons. So if your hair is a mess at that moment and your view is of a rainy parking lot, that\u2019s what people will see.\n\nThe result is a far cry from the polished, overly curated photos popular on other social media platforms.\n\nThe BeReal app launched in late 2020 and is rapidly growing in popularity among young people. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe concept of BeReal is simple. Once you download the app, you get a notification once a day that it\u2019s time to \u201cBeReal.\u201d That means you have two minutes to snap and post a photo of what you\u2019re doing, no matter how mundane.\n\nThere\u2019s no set time \u2013 the notification comes at random times of the day \u2013 adding to the app\u2019s mystique.\n\n\u201cPush notifications are sent around the world simultaneously at different times each day,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s a secret on how the time is chosen every day, it\u2019s not random.\u201d\n\nThat means the potential window into your life can open at any time. When it does, the app invites you to take a photo of what you\u2019re up to at that moment. It takes a dual photo \u2013 a selfie and one showing what\u2019s in front of you. (BeReal doesn\u2019t permit videos yet.)\n\nThe result is a social feed filled with unedited photos of people doing mostly everyday, unglamorous things \u2013 lounging in pajamas, doing homework, riding the bus, microwaving their dinner.\n\nWith only one post a day, there\u2019s no clutter of friends\u2019 pictures to mindlessly scroll through.

Courtesy Ben Telerski\n\nWhat happens if you don\u2019t post within the two minutes?\n\nWhen you click on the once-a-day BeReal notification, your camera opens within the app along with a timer with a two-minute countdown. You have until the timer runs out to take a picture of what\u2019s in front of you. At the same time, your rear-facing camera snaps a selfie.\n\nThe app will share both images. You can retake them anytime during the two minutes and share them with friends when you\u2019re ready.\n\nBeReal also allows users to take and post the photo later in the day. But it lets your friends know how many hours past the notification that you posted. In short, it puts you on blast for your lack of spontaneity.\n\nWhy are people using it?\n\nBeReal has tapped into marketing on college campuses.

I do not know if BeReal is directly attempting to combat this problem, but it is certainly making some ground toward that goal,\u201d he says.\n\nBeReal won\u2019t make you famous, if you want to become an influencer you can stay on TikTok and Instagram.

Users aren\u2019t as glamorized or fake as some can portray themselves on other platforms,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s something different.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, BeReal says its goal is to create \u201can alternative to addictive social networks\u201d that focus on amassing influence, it says.\n\n\u201cBeReal is your chance to show your friends who you really are,\u201d the company says. \u201cBeReal won\u2019t make you famous, if you want to become an influencer you can stay on TikTok and Instagram.\u201d\n\nAre BeReal posts really so authentic?\n\nThe app doesn\u2019t give you much time to put on makeup or stage your surroundings before you snap and post photos.\n\nBut some users may still try to curate their lives on the app.\n\n\u201cThere is the potential to be just as artificial on BeReal as people tend to be on other platforms,\u201d Telerski says. Some people might ignore the notification to post at a certain time and wait to post until they are dressed up and out at dinner with friends, he says.\n\n\u201cIt is not in the spirit of BeReal and entirely defeats the purpose,\u201d he says. \u201cBeReal should be full of pictures of (people) walking, doing homework and sitting in bed watching Netflix.\u201d\n\nThe young people CNN spoke to have no plans to give up Instagram, TikTok and other social media apps.\n\nNott says she plans to keep letting her guard down on BeReal \u2013 and to keep posting on other social media platforms as well.\n\nTelerski says he tries to maintain a certain level of authenticity on social media regardless of the platform. Authenticity is determined by a person, not an app, he says.\n\n\u201cFor those who think we need a new social media app in order to be truly authentic, maybe we should take that as a sign to be more authentic throughout our existing social media presence,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThink about what social media was originally intended for \u2013 real connection through family and friends keeping up with your life.

The Stoxx European 600 was up 0.72% at the end of its business, and all competitors except one of their regional counterparts had positive results. London's FTSE 100 (FTSE 100) was the biggest gain in major regional markets, up 1.55%. The index rose as Marks and Spencer stock prices rose 2.3%, with a stronger holiday season sales result on Thursday than expected. Germany's DAX has also shown strong growth, with a closing rate of 1.59%.Automakers Daimler and Volkswagen were the biggest contributors to the increase in the index, rising by 4.7% and 4.8%, respectively. France's CAC 40 also rose, with a closing rate of 0.72%. Supermarket retailer Carrefour's share price climbed 4.5%, while oil giant Total jumped 0.9%. The pan-European benchmark has been rising since the beginning of this week, as some speculate that the European Central Bank may raise interest rates as soon as possible at its next meeting in March. The European Central Bank has been cautious about its monetary policy outlook, and President Mario Draghi said earlier this week that the bank will continue to monitor economic data before making a decision on interest rates. On Friday, the euro strengthened against the dollar as investors bet that the central bank could raise rates as soon as possible in March. By the end of business, the single currency had risen 0.3% to $1.207. The rise in European stocks was also driven by a rebound in oil prices. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 0.6% and settled at $55.55 per barrel. In other parts of the European market, FTSE MIB in Italy rose by 0.63%, IBEX 35 in Spain rose by 0.9% and Athex Composite in Greece increased by 1.6% on the same day. In the case of commodities, gold declined by 0.1 per cent and was traded at $1,256.61 per ounce, while copper decreased by 0.6 per cent to $6,246.00 per tonne. In terms of data, the eurozone's inflation rate slowed in November, according to figures released by Eurostat on Friday. Consumer prices fell 1.9% from a 2.0% increase in October. Weak inflation data reinforce the ECB's rationale for maintaining its aristocratic policies. As inflation remains below the bank's 2.0% target, central banks may continue to pursue ultra-easing monetary policy in the foreseeable future. Looking ahead to next week, investors will follow the Bank of England's meeting on Tuesday to learn about the direction of Britain's monetary policy. On Wednesday, the European Central Bank is expected to release its latest monetary policy decision and accompanying statement. U.S. non-agricultural wages will be released on Friday, a key measure of the health of the world's largest economy.", "label": "machine"}

That would be a thing I would change in the future. It's a learned lesson,\" Moscow Police Chief James Fry told NBC News on Saturday during an emotional sit-down interview in which he teared up.\n\nFry said getting a message out earlier could have reduced some public anxiety and fear.\n\nA more transparent approach, Fry said, would \"give a little bit of assurance to people that we've locked the scene down. We're getting search warrants. We got the state police coming. We got the FBI coming. I think that gives a little bit of calm.\"\n\nFry and the department were heavily criticized during the nearly two-month investigation for a lack of transparency and for sending mixed messages about the case.\n\nThe shocking crimes have captivated the nation, generating about 19,000 tips from the public that police said were crucial to the probe.\n\nBryan Christopher Kohberger, 28, a resident of Pullman, Washington, was apprehended in Albrightsville in northeastern Pennsylvania, about 2,500 miles from the Idaho campus, officials announced Friday.\n\nHe\u2019ll be charged with four counts of first-degree murder and burglary, for allegedly breaking into the Moscow, Idaho, home with the intent to commit a felony, authorities said.\n\nDNA evidence played a key role in linking the murders to Kohberger, two law enforcement sources familiar with the investigation told NBC News.\n\nKohberger was arrested by the Pennsylvania State Police seven weeks after four students were stabbed to death in their beds \u2014 an event that stunned residents in tiny Moscow, perplexed police and prompted a nationwide manhunt.\n\nFry apologized Saturday to the families of the victims for their heartache. He said he hoped the suspect's arrest leads to some closure for the families and noted investigators will do everything possible to provide them with answers.\n\n\"We care. We've always cared and we'll continue to work hard to give them the answers they need. We can give them answers and we can give them some closure to understand. That's what we're here to offer.

I stayed focused on that. I stayed true to that,\" Fry said. \"We stayed true and the result is we got an individual in custody.\"\n\nIn Monroe County, Pa. where the suspect was apprehended Friday, some residents interviewed by NBC News recounted run-ins with Kohberger prior to the slayings in Idaho.\n\nJordan Serulneck, 34, lives in Center Valley, and is owner of Seven Sirens Brewing Company. Serulneck says Kohberger came to his brewery a few times and female staff would often complain about his behavior. Serulneck said the brewery is located in a college town and it\u2019s not unusual for them to get \u201cunusual characters,\u201d but he remembered Kohberger from some interactions he had with female patrons and staff. He said Kohberger often come by himself, sit at the bar and be \u201cobserving and watching.\u201d\n\nSerulneck said staff scans everyone\u2019s ID\u2019s and they have a system where they can add notes about a patron that pop up whenever the ID is scanned.\n\n\u201cStaff put in there, \u2018Hey, this guy makes creepy comments, keep an eye on him. He\u2019ll have two or three beers and then just get a little too comfortable.\u2019\u201d Serulneck said Kohberger would ask the female staff or customers who they were at the brewery with, where they lived. He said if the women blew him off, \u201che would get upset with them a little bit,\u201d noting that one time he called one of his staff members a b---- when she refused to answer his questions.\n\nThese interactions were months ago, Serulneck said, likely when Kohberger was a student at DeSales. During their final interaction Serulneck said he approached Kohberger.\n\n\u201cI went up to him and I said, \u2018Hey Bryan, welcome back. We appreciate you coming back. \u2026 I just wanted to talk to you real quick and make sure that you\u2019re going to be respectful this time and we\u2019re not going to have any issues.\u2019\" He said Kohberger was taken aback. \"He was shocked that I was saying that, and he said, \u2018I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. You totally have me confused.\u2019\u201d He said Kohberger had one beer and left and he never came back to the brewery.\n\nBK Norton, a WSU classmate of Kohberger, told NBC News that they first met him in August at a student orientation. \"We took classes together this past semester. We didn\u2019t work on any project together but we spent extensive time together because our courses were very long,\" Norton said. Norton said Kohberger seemed \"odd from the beginning\" but they thought it was because he was awkward.\n\n\"I am in complete shock over this murder, because he continued to attend classes and continued on like nothing had happened, I still can\u2019t wrap my head around it,\" Norton said. \"He did attend class, up until the end of the semester and seemed more upbeat, honestly.

{"text": ".. Market watchers who observe the price of coal in China, the world's largest consumer, can be excused for believing that China's economic recovery is back on track. Over the past few months, as economic activity has begun to pick up again, coal prices have risen in major hubs, including Qinhuangdao and the Plateau. This is because China, the world's largest consumer and importer of coal, is expected to restart its economy after the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in increased demand for coal and higher prices. According to China's General Administration of Customs, China's coal imports rose 18.7% year-on-year in October and reached 26.4 million tons. This is an increase of 7.4% from the same period last year, indicating that domestic coal producers are stepping up efforts to meet growing demand. The bulk of imported coal is imported from abroad, and activity in China's major coal import hubs has also increased. In recent months, both the port of Qinhuangdao and the port of Cao Fei have seen an increase in activity, as they remain the main gateways for imports into China. According to the China Coal Association, imports of Qinhuangdao, the country's largest coal port, surged to a record high in October, with more than 25.3 million tons of coal entering the port. This is an increase of 5.4% over the same period last year. The increase in port activity was driven by the restocking of coal stocks at steel mills expected during the winter season, as well as strong demand from the power sector, both of which led to higher spot prices for ports. Meanwhile, in the port of Cao Fei, coal imports totaled about 1.2 million tons in October, which is more than double the same period a year ago, indicating that activity at the port is experiencing the same growth. In recent months, the port has become increasingly attractive due to relatively low fees and taxes compared to other ports, making it a good choice for buyers. Overall, the increased activity in China's major coal import hubs is an indication of the country's economic recovery and a rebound in demand for coal. It is clear that the country is prepared to rely on coal as part of its recovery efforts, and that the industry is ready to meet growing demand. Analysts expect this trend to continue in the coming months, with coal prices expected to remain supportive and imports still strong. This is good news for global coal producers and consumers, because China is one of the largest markets in both. And as the country's economic recovery returns on track, it could be a long-term positive contribution to the global coal industry.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nRepublican Rep.-elect George Santos admitted to stealing a man\u2019s checkbook that was in his mother\u2019s possession to purchase clothing and shoes in 2008, according to documents obtained by CNN.\n\nThe admission came in a statement Santos gave to police in 2010, according to 150 pages worth of case documents.\n\nPolice had suspended an investigation into Santos because they were unable to find him for nearly a decade. But law enforcement officials in Brazil will reinstate fraud charges against the New York Republican, CNN reported Tuesday.\n\nSantos used stolen checks to make purchases at a shop in Niter\u00f3i, a city outside of Rio de Janeiro on June 17, 2008, according to court documents. When making the purchase, he used an ID card with the checkbook owner\u2019s name and a picture of himself, according to police documents.\n\nPolice summoned Santos several times in 2008, 2009 and 2010 to speak to them. Santos\u2019 mother told the police in November 2010 that the checks were stolen from a checkbook she had in her purse belonging to Delio da Camara da Costa Alemao, who died a year prior to her speaking with police, and that her son had used four checks. Santos\u2019 mother was Costa Alemao\u2019s nurse prior to his death.\n\nSpeaking with the police for the first time that month, Santos confessed he stole the checkbook from his mom\u2019s purse and that he used \u201csome sheets\u201d to make purchases. Santos confessed to forging the man\u2019s signature on two checks to purchase clothes and shoes costing approximately $1,313.63 on the date of the forgery, and confirmed it was his signature on the forged checks.\n\nHe also told police he was an American with dual citizenship, was White and a professor, police documents show.\n\nSantos said his mother, who only learned of the stolen checks around a month after he took them, asked him \u201cwith despair\u201d to return the checkbook, but he had already ripped up the remaining checks and threw them in a manhole.\n\n\u201cHe [Santos] acknowledged having been responsible for forging the signatures on the checks, also confirming that he had destroyed the remaining checks,\u201d authorities wrote in an inquiry report about Santos. The document containing the confession was signed by Santos on November 18, 2010.\n\nCNN has reached out to an attorney for Santos.\n\nSuspicious checks\n\nSantos signed two checks at the store as if he was the account owner, court documents show. The checks were intended to pay for the purchase in two installments \u2013 set for July 25 and August 25, 2008.\n\nThe store clerk became suspicious after the signatures on the checks did not match, he told police. Two days after Santos made the purchases, a man named Thiago came into the same store with the shoes Santos had purchased and tried to return them for a different size. He said a friend gave him the shoes and was unaware of any illicit activity.\n\nThe clerk had to pay the amount of the fraudulent purchase in installments to the store, he told police, although the store ended up waving some of the payments for the clerk, the store manager told the police in 2010. Soon after the sale, they were able to find the bank account\u2019s owner and talk to him on the phone, the manager said. He said he had closed the account in 2006 after losing the checkbook.\n\nAt one point the clerk was able to track down Santos using social media and, he said, Santos promised to pay him back but never did. The clerk turned over pictures of Santos to police that he had found on social media. Screenshots of the conversations between the clerk and Santos are included in the documents obtained by CNN.\n\nSantos told investigators that neither his mother, nor his friend Thiago, were aware of the fraudulent purchases at the time of the crime.\n\nEfforts to find Santos\n\nIn June 2011, investigators filed a request with the Civil Police to take immediate judicial measures against Santos. In September, a judge summoned him to respond to the complaint through an attorney. Neither Santos nor an attorney ever responded. Three months later, authorities tried to deliver a summons for Santos at the prior home of his mother but he was not able to be located and she no longer lived there.\n\nAgain in 2013, neither Santos, nor his mother or grandmother at their former addresses, were able to be located. In October of that year, an edict was published in Rio de Janeiro\u2019s justice gazette summoning him to appear in court after authorities were unable to locate him. Santos was given 10 days to offer his defense but he never appeared. A judge eventually suspended the statute of limitations in order for the case to be reopened later if Santos was found, the documents show.\n\nAs recently as October 2020, a document from the judiciary said they still had never been able to locate Santos to prosecute him for the crime.\n\nBrazilian authorities, having now verified Santos\u2019 location, will make a formal request to the US Justice Department to notify Santos of the charges, Maristela Pereira, a spokeswoman for the Rio de Janeiro prosecutor\u2019s office, told CNN. The prosecutor\u2019s office told CNN the request will be filed upon reopening on Friday.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Post last week, Santos denied that he had been charged with any crime in Brazil, saying: \u201cI am not a criminal here \u2013 not here or in Brazil or any jurisdiction in the world. Absolutely not. That didn\u2019t happen.\u201d", "label": "human"}

{"text": "U.S. President Joe Biden speaks about U.S.-Mexico border security and enforcement, in the Roosevelt Room at the White House in Washington, U.S., January 5, 2023.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is heading to the U.S.-Mexico border on Sunday, his first trip there as president after two years of hounding by Republicans who have hammered him as soft on border security while the number of migrants crossing spirals.\n\nBiden is due to spend a few hours in El Paso, Texas, currently the biggest corridor for illegal crossings, due in large part to Nicaraguans fleeing repression, crime and poverty in their country. They are among migrants from four countries who are now subject to quick expulsion under new rules enacted by the Biden administration in the past week.\n\nThe president is expected to meet with border officials to discuss migration as well as the increased trafficking of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, which are driving skyrocketing numbers of overdoses in the U.S.\n\nBiden will visit the El Paso County Migrant Services Center and meet with nonprofits and religious groups that support migrants arriving to the U.S. It is not clear whether Biden will talk to any migrants.\n\n\"The president's very much looking forward to seeing for himself firsthand what the border security situation looks like,\" said John Kirby, White House national security spokesman. \"This is something that he wanted to see for himself.\"\n\nBiden's announcement on border security and his visit to the border are aimed in part at quelling the political noise and blunting the impact of upcoming investigations into immigration promised by House Republicans. But any enduring solution will require action by the sharply divided Congress, where multiple efforts to enact sweeping changes have failed in recent years.\n\nRepublican Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John Cornyn of Texas offered faint praise for Biden's decision to visit the border, and even that was notable in the current political climate.\n\n\"He must take the time to learn from some of the experts I rely on the most, including local officials and law enforcement, landowners, nonprofits, U.S. Customs and Border Protection's officers and agents, and folks who make their livelihoods in border communities on the front lines of his crisis,\" Cornyn said.\n\nFrom El Paso, Biden will continue south to Mexico City, where he and the leaders of Mexico and Canada will gather on Monday and Tuesday for a North American leaders summit. Immigration is among the items on the agenda.\n\nIn El Paso, where migrants congregate at bus stops and in parks before traveling on, border patrol agents have stepped up security before Biden's visit.\n\n\"I think they're trying to send a message that they're going to more consistently check people's documented status, and if you have not been processed they are going to pick you up,\" said Ruben Garcia of the Annunciation House aid group in El Paso.\n\nMigrants and asylum-seekers fleeing violence and persecution have increasingly found that protections in the United States are available primarily to those with money or the savvy to find someone to vouch for them financially.\n\nJose Natera, a Venezuelan migrant in El Paso who hopes to seek asylum in Canada, said he has no prospects for finding a U.S. sponsor and that he's now reluctant to seek asylum in the U.S. because he's afraid of being sent to Mexico.\n\nMexico \"is a terrible country where there is crime, corruption, cartels and even the police persecute you,\" he said. \"They say that people who think about entering illegally won't have a chance, but at the same time I don't have a sponsor. \u2026 I came to this country to work. I didn't come here to play.\"\n\nThe numbers of migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border has risen dramatically during Biden's first two years in office. There were more than 2.38 million stops during the year that ended Sept. 30, the first time the number topped 2 million. The administration has struggled to clamp down on crossings, reluctant to take hard-line measures that would resemble those of the Trump administration.\n\nThe policy changes announced this past week are Biden's biggest move yet to contain illegal border crossings and will turn away tens of thousands of migrants arriving at the border. At the same time, 30,000 migrants per month from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela will get the chance to come to the U.S. legally as long as they travel by plane, get a sponsor and pass background checks.\n\nThe U.S. will also turn away migrants who do not seek asylum first in a country they traveled through en route to the U.S.\n\nThe changes were welcomed by some, particularly leaders in cities where migrants have been massing. But Biden was excoriated by immigrant advocate groups, which accused him of taking measures modeled after those of the former president.\n\n\"I do take issue with comparing us to Donald Trump,\" said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, pointing to some of his most maligned policies, including the separation of migrant children from their parents.\n\n\"This is not that president,\" she said.\n\nFor all of his international travel over his 50 years in public service, Biden has not spent much time at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe only visit that the White House could point to was Biden's drive by the border while he was campaigning for president in 2008. He sent Vice President Kamala Harris to El Paso in 2021, but she was criticized for largely bypassing the action, because El Paso wasn't the center of crossings that it is now.\n\nPresident Barack Obama made a 2011 trip to El Paso, where he toured border operations and the Paso Del Norte international bridge, but he was later criticized for not going back as tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors crossed into the U.S. from Mexico.\n\nTrump, who made hardening immigration a signature issue, traveled to the border several times. During one visit, he crammed into a small border station to inspect cash and drugs confiscated by agents. During a trip to McAllen, Texas, then the center of a growing crisis, he made one of his most-often repeated claims, that Mexico would pay to build a border wall.\n\nAmerican taxpayers ended up footing the bill after Mexican leaders flatly rejected the idea.\n\n\"NO,\" Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, then Mexico's president, tweeted in May 2018. \"Mexico will NEVER pay for a wall. Not now, not ever. Sincerely, Mexico (all of us).\"", "label": "human"}
{"text": ".. Caracas, January 5, 2023 - Economists have warned that Venezuela's inflation rate is accelerating again, exacerbating the risk of a return to hyperinflation and economic chaos in the once prosperous South American country. The latest inflation data released by the Central Bank of Venezuela on Thursday showed that in the 12 months to December, the rate had risen to 4.115%, almost double the previous month's record of 2.129%, well above the central bank's target of 3,000%. The news of rising inflation comes from Venezuela's economy still in deep recession, with gross domestic product contracting for the sixth straight year in 2020, and President Nicolas Maduro's government struggling to implement a bailout plan. The Maduro government is desperately trying to stop the spiral of hyperinflation, as it has done repeatedly in the past. It introduced price controls, its new central bank governor raised interest rates and limited the amount of money available for lending. But economists said those measures were not enough to stop the country from returning to hyperinflation, which some predicted could reach 10,000 percent this year. \"The government's economic policies have clearly failed, and we are heading towards a situation of complete economic chaos,\" said Ricardo Hausmann, a former official in Maduro's administration. \"In recent years, the agricultural sector has been hit by drought and a lack of investment, while manufacturing is struggling with a lack of foreign exchange to buy inputs and equipment.\" The country is now facing food shortages, soaring prices and a currency collapse. Bolivar's current value is only a fraction of pre-crisis values, meaning that most Venezuelans do not have access to the price of basic goods and services. The situation has been further aggravated by the ongoing political crisis, with the United States and other countries imposing sanctions on Maduro's government in response to its growing authoritarian policies and human rights abuses. Sanctions have made it more difficult for governments to manage their fiscal and monetary policies. \"Sanctions have weakened the Maduro government's ability to finance itself and its economy,\" said Carlos Gomez, an economist who has been monitoring the situation. \"It also makes it harder for the government to import goods, which means that prices of imported goods rise and the local currency weakens further.\" Given the current crisis, economists say governments must implement policies to achieve economic growth and stability while addressing the humanitarian crisis. \"Venezuela needs economic reforms that will both lead to economic growth and address the social problems facing the country,\" said David Smilde, an economist. \"The government needs to respond to the humanitarian crisis by increasing the supply of basic goods, providing basic services for the population, and creating jobs.\" The situation in Venezuela is very serious, and the country's future remains uncertain. But economists say that with the right policies, the country can still avoid a recurrence of hyperinflation and start on its path to recovery.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Bank of America expects SABIC's agricultural nutrition stocks to rise by at least 50 percent this year due to a global fertilizer shortage, the bank announced in a study Monday. A study by Bank of America stock strategist John Viviani noted that the global supply of nitrogen fertilizers was short, and grain prices spiked accordingly in late 2020 and early 2021. The shortage is compounded by poor harvests in the United States and abroad, as well as rapidly increasing demand from emerging markets and developed countries. \"The global epidemic has further exacerbated the fertilizer crisis, which is causing significant disruption to shipping and supply chains,\" Viviani wrote in the report. He added that SABIC, the world's largest nitrogen-based fertilizer producer, has a unique advantage to take advantage of and its share will benefit greatly. The study also highlights the fact that global shortages have caused nitrogen fertilizer prices to rise by more than 20% since the beginning of this year, while SABIC's share price has risen by 5%. Viviani said: \"Given the global nature of this supply side issue and that SABIC is the largest producer of nitrogen-based fertilizers, we expect the company's share price to rise by at least 50% this year. \"As the supply side is unlikely to change significantly in the near future, we expect SABIC shares to continue to rise as the world struggles to increase crop production,\" said William Jackson, an analyst at Credit Suisse. Similarly, Goldman Sachs analyst David Parker pointed out that the company's large market share and its ability to stay agile in volatile market conditions could lead to a significant increase in the company's stock price. \"SABIC is well positioned to benefit from the global fertilizer shortage,\" Parker wrote in his research paper. \"It occupies a huge market share and can quickly adapt to changing market conditions, which makes it an excellent choice for investors looking to reach out to the industry.\" The news was also welcomed by investors, with SABIC's share price up 1.7% on the day of the study note release. However, the company's earnings may be limited by the fact that it operates in a highly cyclical sector and that fertilizer prices are likely to fall significantly in the near future. In addition, the company faces political and economic risks in many countries where it operates, which may limit its long-term growth potential. Despite these risks, SABIC agricultural nutrition appears to be a strong long-term investment that could benefit from the current global fertilizer shortage.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "KUALA (Reuters) - Many analysts were surprised by Malaysian voters' choice of conservative leaders in Saturday's fierce election, which could lead to more conservative policies and less than expected economic progress. Voters have chosen Muhyiddin Yassin as prime minister, rather than the leader of the progressive Katan Harappan Union (PH), who served at the time of the election. Experts say this could mean adopting a more conservative policy toward the progressives while continuing with previous coalition initiatives. \"It's a bit surprising for us,\" said Nur Jazlan Mohamed, MP of the Barisan Alliance (BN) and former deputy interior minister. He said the results showed a reversal with the 2018 poll, which turned to progressive politics when the PH coalition came to power. \"This suggests that voters may prefer to be conservative in their approach,\" he added. But the BN's victory was not decisive. For the coalition to take power, it would have to fight against opponents on both sides of the political spectrum. In addition to the Kuomintang coalition, a coalition of Islamic fundamentalist parties called Perikatan Nasional (PN) also played a role in the election. These parties were previously excluded from supporting a more progressive GOP coalition and tried to appeal to religious voters with stronger policies and rhetoric. Many experts had assumed that the efforts of the Nationalist Alliance would attract support from the People's Party, but this did not seem to be the case. \"Ultimately, the Kuomintang vote appears to be insignificant or not significant enough to change the outcome of the election,\" said James Chin, a political scientist at the University of Tasmania. The fact that the Kuomintang was able to win a weak majority, despite the existence of an NCP coalition, seems to indicate that voters have decided to consider the Kuomintang as the party they believe is best equipped to lead the country. \"I think the voter decision to Muhyiddin and BN is the most stable option, and it's most likely to continue over the next few years,\" Chin said. Despite the National Party's victory, analysts say it has little room to significantly change Malaysia. The lack of a clear majority in parliament means that the coalition must be careful when implementing policies or introducing changes. \"The government will take a hard line here,\" said Thanaletchimi Subramaniam, former director of the Election Commission. Nevertheless, analysts do not see the Kuomintang victory as a setback for Malaysia. Nur Jazlan says it is important that the country has a stable government capable of making decisions and pushing them forward. \"I think what we need now is a stable and united government that can take care of the people and still get the country back on track,\" he said. Analysts also point out that the Bank of England may continue to implement most of the initiatives taken by the former PH coalition. \"The Bank of England is not entirely opposed to the reforms initiated by PH, but it will go much slower,\" Tanalechimi said. Overall, Malaysia's election seems to boil down to a choice between stability and progress. The ballot cast on Saturday appears to indicate that Malaysians have made the mistake of conservatism - choosing stability over radical change. But this does not mean that progress in Malaysia will stagnate. Analysts believe the National Party (BN), which has a weak majority and needs to win bipartisan support, can bring about some modest change, if not rapid growth, in the coming years. \"I think, at least in the short term, people will focus on policy continuity,\" Chin said, \"but I think that long-term reforms are likely to proceed at a slower pace.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Both cardiac arrest, heart attack and heart failure have the same underlying cause - muscle disease - but each condition has a very different effect on the body as well as available treatments. A cardiac arrest is a sudden loss of heart function, when the electrical signals in the electrocardiogram system become chaotic, the heart stops delivering blood to the body and brain. In a cardiac arrest, the heart stops suddenly without warning, usually without any pain or warning. A heart attack or myocardial infarction is when the part of the heart muscle stops receiving enough blood and oxygen. This is usually due to coronary artery blockage, which transports blood to the heart. If not treated promptly, a heart attack can cause chest pain or discomfort, and may even lead to death. Heart failure refers to the heart's inability to deliver enough blood and oxygen to the body. Cardiac failure can be caused by a range of conditions, such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, obesity, and diabetes. Symptoms of heart failure include short breathing, fatigue, and swelling of the legs, ankles, and feet. All three conditions can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. But treatment for each condition depends on the type and severity of the condition. A cardiac arrest is usually an electrical shock called deoxynucleic acid to help restore a normal rhythm. When it comes to managing any of these heart conditions, it's important to understand the differences between them and pay attention to your symptoms. If you experience any signs or symptoms of these conditions, seek medical care immediately. Understanding the differences between these heart conditions can help you identify signs and symptoms and get the help you need.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Lionel Messi, one of the greatest football players ever, returned to training in Paris Saint-Germain after leading Argentina's first World Cup victory. The news of Messi's return to Paris was warmly welcomed by the club and its fans, as it is no surprise that the five-time World Player of the Year has been successful at the highest level of the tournament. The 32-year-old former Barcelona man is one of the most decorated football players in the world, winning four Champions League titles, ten La Liga titles and six Golden Globes. The five-time Golden Globe winner was a huge success in Paris, having led the team to four League titles during his five years at the club. He also scored nearly one hundred goals in all of France's Giants games, and his influence and experience were critical to the team's success. On Tuesday, after arriving in Paris, Messi attended his first training session with PSG since he returned from Argentina's international mission. After the meeting, manager Thomas Tuchel spoke of his pleasure in bringing a world-class forward back to the team. \"It's great to have him back.Leonel is a great professional player and a true leader who sets an excellent example for other players, whose presence will help us achieve our goals,\" he said. Messi's return to the French capital is just one of many changes that have taken place at the club since he last joined the PSG jersey. The club has added some of the best players in the world and greatly improved its position in European football. For Messi, the task now is to return to a state that has made him one of the world's most fearsome attackers. He hopes to lead the club to further success in the Champions League and help them maintain their French title for the fifth consecutive season. It's clear that Messi's return to PSG is a huge boost for the club and will certainly be praised by supporters of the club. Messi will definitely be an indispensable addition to the team, and there is no doubt that he will seek to take PSG to the next level in the Champions League and beyond. For PSG and its fans, hopefully this is the beginning of a period of success for the club and its star players as five-time Golden Globe winners hope to lead them into more silver in the near future.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Back in July, a group of 21 quality assurance workers at Activision\u2019s Albany studio\u2014formerly known as Vicarious Visions\u2014announced their intentions to unionise. Today, the National Labor Relations Board have confirmed that their vote can go ahead.\n\n\n\nThe ruling came about because\u2014and stop me if you\u2019ve heard this one before\u2014publishers Activision Blizzard initially opposed the move, saying that a larger group of 88 developers should be included in the vote. It was a textbook piece of union-busting that has also been tried at other Activision studios going through the process of unionisation.\n\nIn this case it hasn\u2019t worked; the NLRB\u2019s ruling today clears the path for the workers to vote on forming a union, disagreeing (in a detailed breakdown explaining how work differs between each of the studio\u2019s departments, and how underpaid testers are) with Activision\u2019s claims that, \u201cwe believe every employee in Albany who works on Diablo should have a direct say in this decision.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ruling concludes:\n\nBased on the above, I conclude that the employees in the petitioned-for unit share a community of interest. I have also considered the similarities that exist among the developers and compared this to the testers. Developers are organized in separate departments, but departments that ultimately report to the head of the Diablo franchise. Developers have a diverse set of skills, training, and duties, but use these skills in a complementary manner in a production process that includes significant amount of contact and a high degree of functional integration. Compensation varies, but many terms and conditions of employment do have overlap among the developers. Comparing the developers\u2019 community of interest to that of the testers I find that the distinct interests of the testers outweigh the similarities that exist with the developers. As noted, the testers participate in the same game development process that includes significant contact and functional integration. However, testers are separately organized in their own department and their supervisory hierarchy is entirely separate from the Diablo franchise. Testers also have a specific set of skills and duties different from the developers. Finally, testers are paid significantly less than developers. Moreover, the evidence of interchange between testers and developers is extremely limited. For these reasons I find any shared interests between the testers and developers do not outweigh the separate interests that make the petitioned-for unit an appropriate unit.\n\nThe ruling instantly clears the path for an election, which will begin soon. Ballots will be sent out on October 27, with votes being counted on November 18.\n\nA current employee at the studio, though not one of the testers involved in the vote, told the Washington Post, \u201cIt\u2019s about time. Our QA testers are some of the most talented and skilled people working in our company and they are critically undervalued by corporate. I think that all games workers need a union, but QA is in especially dire need.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUpdate 10:00pm ET: Lulu Cheng Meservey, Activision Blizzard\u2019s \u2018executive vice president, corporate affairs and chief communications officer\u2019, has responded to the finding on internal communications, writing:\n\nHey all, quick heads up on something important. It\u2019s a long one but wanna be thorough so thanks for bearing with me. This afternoon the NLRB (national labor relations board) determined that -20 QA (quality assurance) testers working on Diablo in Albany will be eligible to form a union and if the union wins the vote will be included in the bargaining unit. Where the company stands on that: fully respects the NLRB process, and fully supports the employees\u2019 right to choose how they want to be represented. Also has the view that people who work closely together should be able to make decisions like that collectively - ie, we disagree that a handful of employees should get to decide for everyone else on the future of the entire Albany-based Diablo team. We think a direct dialogue between company and employees is the most productive route. Examples: through direct dialogue we\u2019ve already converted contingent QA staff to full time, increased pay, increased benefits, opened up access to the bonus program, and offered more opportunities for professional advancement (which would also result in more pay). We feel collective bargaining is comparatively slow- once agreement is in place takes over a year on average according to a Bloomberg analysis. During the long contract negotiation, companies are forbidden from giving any pay/bonus/benefi t increases without a special arrangement with the union, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that non-union employees generally get larger pay raises than union-represented groups. That\u2019s consistent with what we saw with Raven, where there have only been three bargaining sessions since the union was certified there almost 6 months ago, due partly to the union cancelling pre-planned bargaining sessions for a month. I\u2019m sharing all of that because having a streamlined process is a reason why the company prefers direct discussions - but ultimately it\u2019s up to employees and everyone should get to vote their own preference in a fair election. What happens next with this is that ballots will be mailed to eligible Albany-based employees on Oct. 27, need to be returned by Nov. 17, and will get counted by the NLRB on Nov. 18. More to come as the process continues but wanted to share asap. Thanks so much for reading everyone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUpdate 11/2/22 12:33 p.m. ET: Activision is now appealing the decision with the NLRB and calling on it to stop the vote in the meantime. Specifically, the company wants the votes that were already sent to employees\u2019 homes to be \u201cimpounded\u201d until the appeal is completed, lest any preliminary results \u201cprejudice\u201d a future vote in the event that Activision wins the appeal.\n\nThe company argues that video game development is unique and unprecedented compared to other industries the NLRB has dealt with, and for that reason its original decision was flawed and based on several misunderstandings. As just one example, Activision insinuates that the development of Diablo is much more complex than Call of Duty, and therefore teams at Blizzard Albany are much more integrated than those at Raven, where Activision\u2019s legal arguments previously failed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear the company\u2019s executives feel threatened by workers organizing in New York, Wisconsin and across the country,\u201d responded CWA Secretary-Treasurer Sara Steffens in a statement. \u201cWe are confident in the NLRB\u2019s response to these frivolous requests, and we will continue to push for Activision Blizzard employees\u2019 right to organize without delay.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUpdate 11/2/22 2:55 p.m. ET: Activision spokesperson Rich George provided the following statement:", "label": "human"}

To ensure our listed platforms were legit, we considered many things, including tie-ups with top credit bureaus.\n\nA poor credit score is often why people cannot get hold of loans to take care of their different needs. Our ranking factors have been decided to keep in mind the needs of everyone.\n\nCredit Score Requirement\n\nA minimum credit score requirement often prevents people from getting loans through traditional sources. However, we discovered platforms that connect you with personal loan lenders ready to credit money into your bank account without considering your credit scores.\n\nYou do not have to maintain a minimum credit score to be able to borrow significant amounts from the many lenders who are available on these platforms dedicated to helping you out. The online lender does not care about your credit scores, and we have listed only those platforms with no minimum credit score needed to borrow cash. Your credit report doesn\u2019t matter either.\n\nLoan Amount Offered\n\nThe loan amount that you can borrow is one of the major deciding factors for deciding which platforms work. You should be able to get flexible loan amounts from the providers. We have selected platforms that offer different loan amount options ranging from very low to very high. On one platform, you can get a loan amount of up to $50,000 in a single day.\n\nThe flexibility of the loan amounts is something that we look for. We looked for personal loan lenders who can give you a loan amount as low as $100 if that\u2019s all you need. Usually, it is difficult to get a high loan amount if you have a poor credit score. However, using the platforms we have listed, you can get auto loans in the loan amount you want directly in your bank account.\n\nInterest Rates\n\nThe interest rates must be reasonable and negotiable to worry about the monthly payment and not bother much about how much you need to repay due to excessive interest rates. We selected those platforms where the personal loan lenders charged reasonable interest rates against the loan amount you borrowed.\n\nWhether the amount you borrow is towards your debt consolidation loans or anything else, they have to be reasonable when comparing interest rates. Interest rates were among the most important deciding factors when renting with the different platforms.\n\nLoan Types Offered \u2013 Secured vs. Unsecured\n\nThe loan types offered also had to be taken into consideration, and we preferred those platforms that offered maximum unsecured loan sizes and those personal loan lenders who were ready to give a high secured loan amount as well as unsecured personal loans that you can use as you need to take care of your personal expenses.\n\nIrrespective of your credit score, you should be able to get hold of different types of loans, including unsecured ones, and we made sure that our platforms offered you enough options for the same. You can use these loans to repay your credit card debt.\n\nLoan Options Available\n\nThe loan options available are an essential criterion for deciding which platform is right for you. The availability of different loan options is critical because you require different types of loans. Sometimes, you require debt consolidation loans to cover your current needs.\n\nWhether for a credit card or a simple debt consolidation loan, or a payday loan for bad credit that you want to use for other personal needs, it is essential to have multiple loan options available without any credit check procedures. Our platforms are ready to offer you all kinds of loans, including auto loans, without any credit check procedures or hassles of the strict monthly payment.\n\nDocumentation Requirements and Credit Check\n\nWe ensured that the documentation requirements were minimal in the selected platforms for you. A soft credit check is all you will have to go through to get money from the personal loan lenders on these platforms.\n\nThe credit check procedures are relatively simple. A soft credit check replaces the need for extensive documentation for the online lender to decide whether they can give you the money to repay your credit card debt and other necessities.\n\nYou will be able to connect with direct lenders, in fact, many lenders through the platforms that we have listed out for you, and get hold of money with elementary and straightforward credit check procedures.\n\nOrigination Fees Required\n\nYou should be able to get hold of personal loans without paying much money in origination fees. We kept this in mind when we selected the platforms, and we gave reference to those that did not charge an origination fee.\n\nWe preferred those fair credit platforms that connected you with direct lenders without charging you too much in the name of origination fees. We understand that when you are looking for a loan with bad credit, the last thing you want to be bothered with is a high origination fee.\n\nSpeed of Deposit\n\nThe origination fee is not the only thing that matters. Even if you pay a minimal origination fee, the priority is that the money must be credited into your bank account as soon as possible. When comparing bad credit personal loans, the deposit speed is something that we took pretty seriously.\n\nThe companies that offered the best personal loans ensured that the loan with bad credit was immediately deposited. The companies that provide the best personal loans ensure that the loan with bad credit is immediately deposited into your bank. Just as important as everything else is how you get hold of the personal loans for your various needs.\n\nTies With Credit Bureaus\n\nPlatforms offering personal loans seem to have more validation and accountability if associated with reliable major credit bureaus. Major credit bureaus add credibility to the platforms that give you loans despite having poor credit scores.\n\nA great way to secure a safe loan with fair credit without much of a credit check is to ensure that the platform offering your personal loans is associated with any major bureaus, but this is not the same as a credit union.\n\nRepayment Terms\n\nEven if you have poor credit scores, you should be able to get a loan with bad credit that offers you flexibility when it comes to repayment. We considered those platforms that did not care much about your debt to income ratio and put together personal loan options that can be repaid in the terms you are comfortable with.\n\nMost Bad Credit Loan Companies offer what Types Of Loans?\n\nSeveral types of loans are available to you, depending on your needs and financial situation. Some of the most common include:\n\nPersonal Loans\n\nIf you need money for an emergency or unexpected expense, a personal loan is probably what you\u2019re looking for. Personal loans can be used for anything from home improvements to medical bills. They also offer flexible repayment terms, so you won\u2019t worry about paying back too much.\n\nBanks and credit unions typically offer personal loans. You will likely be asked to provide proof of income and assets such as bank statements, pay stubs, tax returns, etc.\n\nHome Improvement Loans\n\nA home improvement loan will help you pay for repairs or renovations that improve the overall value of your property. These loans usually require a down payment, but they may allow you to finance up to 80% of the project cost. You can use these funds to install new appliances, build a deck, replace windows, paint rooms, etc. Home improvement loans often come with long-term repayment options, making them ideal for people who want to save money over time.\n\nConstruction Loans\n\nConstruction loans are used to construct additions to your home or repair damage caused by natural disasters. Remodeling loans are used to overhaul your home completely. Construction loans typically require larger down payments than other types of loans. If you don\u2019t qualify for a construction loan, you can still apply for a remodeling loan. This type of loan allows you to borrow between 50%-80% of the total project cost.\n\nHard Money Loans \u2013 This type of loan requires no documentation and is typically only offered by real estate investors. It allows you to borrow more than $25,000 without putting any collateral down.\n\nRenovation Loans \u2013 This hard money loan is designed to help homeowners renovate their properties. It is similar to a remodel loan, except it doesn\u2019t require as large of a down payment.\n\nRenovations loans are perfect if you don\u2019t have enough cash to cover all of the costs associated with a significant renovation. If you need to borrow money for a big project like this, a renovation loan might be right for you.\n\nCar Repairs & Maintenance Loans\n\nWhether you need to repair your car or just maintain it, a car maintenance loan can help you get the work done without a second mortgage. This type of loan allows you to finance 100% of the vehicle\u2019s cost. It typically comes with a short term (usually one year) and a longer-term (3 years).\n\nCar repair loans are outstanding if you need to fix something immediately. Most lenders will accept a damaged vehicle as security for a loan, but you should always check with your lender before taking this route. It is important to note that some lenders may not consider a damaged vehicle acceptable security.\n\nStudent Loan Refinancing\n\nRefinancing your student loans can be a great way to reduce your monthly payments. However, refinancing isn\u2019t always possible. Your credit score and other factors play into whether or not you qualify for a refinance. If you do qualify, you may be able to lower your interest rate by 0.5%.\n\nIf you\u2019re a student, you might be able to borrow money through a federal student loan program. There are two main types of federal student loans \u2013 Stafford and Perkins. These programs allow you to borrow money based on how much you earn each month. If you\u2019re not currently working, you could apply for either of these loans to cover school expenses such as tuition costs, books, and other living expenses.\n\nPrivate Student Loans\n\nPrivate student loans are an alternative to federal student loans. They are generally easier to obtain than federal loans because they are based on your income rather than your credit history. The downside is that private student loans tend to carry higher interest rates.\n\nWhen choosing between private and federal student loans, it is best to choose the one that fits your needs. For example, if you plan to attend school full-time, a private student loan would be better suited. On the other hand, a federal student loan would be good if you plan to go part-time.\n\nBusiness Loans\n\nA small business loan might be right for you if you own a business. Many small businesses don\u2019t qualify for traditional bank financing because their credit isn\u2019t strong enough. However, many alternative funding sources are available to business owners like you. A business loan can provide you with the capital you need to grow your company. Most business loans require collateral to secure the loan, such as inventory or equipment.\n\nThese loans are designed to help businesses grow by providing capital to fund growth initiatives. Small business loans are available in increments ranging between $5,000 and $100,000. You may qualify for a more significant amount than this depending on your credit history.\n\nThere are different types of small business loans. These include:\n\nTerm loans \u2013 These loans have fixed terms, usually from 2 to 5 years. You pay back the principal plus interest over the loan term.\n\nRevolving loans \u2013 These loans are also known as a line of credit loans. You make a single payment at the beginning of the loan period and continue making regular payments throughout the life of the loan. This type of loan is ideal for purchasing new equipment or buying inventory.\n\nEquipment loans \u2013 An equipment loan is used to finance purchases of equipment.\n\nWorking Capital Loans \u2013 These loans are used to finance short-term cash flow needs.\n\nYou should consider all of your options before deciding which type of loan will work best for your business.\n\nReverse Mortgage Loan\n\nA reverse mortgage loan lets homeowners age 62 and older draw cash from their homes. Reverse mortgages generally don\u2019t require monthly payments, with few exceptions. For example, if you live in a house worth less than $500,000, you will likely have to pay taxes on any equity you receive.\n\nThe interest rate on a reverse mortgage loan is typically fixed, meaning that it doesn\u2019t change throughout the life of the loan. The loan size depends on several factors, including the borrower\u2019s age, the property\u2019s appraised value, and whether the borrower has other assets. In addition to the principal and interest, borrowers must pay closing costs when they close on the loan.\n\nDebt Consolidation Loans\n\nWhen you combine all your debts into one single debt, it makes it easier to manage. Debt consolidation loans let you consolidate multiple unsecured debts into one secured debt. This means that you only have to repay one lender instead of many. You should expect to see lower rates and fees when you consolidate your debt. You also have more flexibility when it comes to repaying your debt. Debt consolidation loans come in various forms, but most lenders offer an adjustable-rate option.\n\nIn addition to traditional loans, there are many different ways to consolidate debt. Debt consolidation lets you combine multiple debts into one low-interest loan. For example, you could incorporate several high-interest credit cards into one low-interest card. Consolidating your debt can save you thousands in interest charges each year.\n\nPawnshop Loans\n\nIf you need money quickly, you might be able to get a pawnshop loan. A pawn shop loan is similar to a payday loan because both provide fast access to funds. However, a pawnshop loan isn\u2019t based on your income. Instead, you borrow against the value of items you own. If you fail to repay your loan within 30 days, the object becomes the bank\u2019s collateral.\n\nPawnshop loans aren\u2019t available everywhere. Some states prohibit them entirely. Before applying for a pawnshop loan, check with local laws to ensure that this type of loan is legal where you live.\n\nHome Equity Line Of Credit (HELOC)\n\nA home equity line of credit allows you to tap into the equity in your home as needed. Home equity lines of credit are often referred to as \u201csecond mortgages.\u201d They allow you to use the equity in your home to make large purchases or cover unexpected expenses.\n\nFor example, suppose you want to buy a new car. Your current auto loan won\u2019t cover the total cost of a new vehicle. To cover the difference, you could take out a second mortgage. Or, you could apply for a home equity line of credit. With a HELOC, you would put down a small amount of money and add additional amounts.\n\nYou can usually choose how much you want to borrow. As long as you keep up with the required payments, you can continue borrowing as much as you need.\n\nPersonal Loan Refinancing\n\nRefinancing a personal loan is another way to reduce your monthly payment. Personal loans are designed to help you meet short-term financial needs such as paying off medical bills or buying furniture. Unlike a home equity line of credits, refinancing a personal loan involves taking out a new loan.\n\nRefinancing your personal loan may not always be possible. But if you do qualify, refinancing will likely result in a lower interest rate. It also allows you to pay less than what you originally borrowed.\n\nCredit Builder Loans\n\nMany people find themselves unable to obtain a traditional loan due to bad credit or limited credit history. In these cases, you may be eligible for a credit builder loan. These types of loans are designed to give you the chance to build good credit.\n\nTo qualify for a credit builder loan, you must first prove that you have a steady job. Then, you must show that you have been making regular payments on your existing debt. Finally, you must demonstrate that you have enough cash flow to handle missed payments.\n\nBefore you apply for a credit builder loan:\n\nMake sure you understand all terms and conditions.\n\nBe prepared to document your employment status and income.\n\nKnow whether you have an active bankruptcy or foreclosure case.\n\nYou should receive a credit builder loan approval within two weeks if you can complete the application process.\n\nBoat Loans\n\nIf you own a boat, you may be interested in obtaining financing through a private lender. You can use a boat loan to finance the purchase price of a used boat or to refinance an existing loan.\n\nIn addition to providing you with a low-interest rate, a boat loan offers some other benefits. For one thing, you don\u2019t have to worry about getting preapproved for a bank loan. If you qualify, you can get approved immediately. And because most lenders require only proof of ownership, it\u2019s easy to provide this documentation.\n\nWhen considering a boat loan, consider the following factors:\n\nThe size of the loan. Smaller loans tend to carry higher rates of interest.\n\nThe length of the loan term. A longer loan term means you will repay more over the life of the loan.\n\nWhether you plan to make a sizeable down payment, lenders generally prefer borrowers who make larger down payments.\n\nThe type of insurance coverage you desire. Boat owners often opt for comprehensive coverage. This includes liability insurance, which protects against accidents caused by the borrower. Comprehensive coverage also covers damage from theft or fire.\n\nRecreation Vehicle (RV) Loans\n\nA recreational vehicle (RV) loan provides you with the flexibility to buy a second home without selling your primary residence. With an RV loan, you can finance up to 80 percent of the cost of a new or used RV.\n\nAn RV loan has several advantages. First, you won\u2019t need to put 20 percent down when purchasing a new RV; instead, you can finance the entire amount using a personal loan. Second, you don\u2019t have to wait until you sell your house to purchase an RV. You can take out a loan while still living at your current address. Third, you can use an RV loan to finance the purchase price and the monthly payments. Fourth, you can use an auto loan to pay off your RV loan. Fifth, you can finance an RV even if you have poor credit.\n\nThe most significant disadvantage of an RV loan is its high-interest rate. Most lenders charge between 15 and 25 percent APR. However, you can negotiate a lower rate with a reputable lender.\n\nFamily Loans\n\nMany families are struggling financially these days. As a result, they turn to family members to help them meet their financial needs. Family loans offer several advantages. One advantage is that they are usually less expensive than traditional loans. Another advantage is that they allow you to borrow money without having to prove that you can afford repayment.\n\nThere are four types of family loans:\n\nHome equity lines of credit (HELOC). These loans enable you to tap into the equity in your home. They typically involve no pre-payment penalties.\n\nRevolving lines of credit. These loans allow you to borrow funds as long as you continue making regular payments. There is no limit on how much you can borrow.\n\nLines of credit secured by real estate. These loans are similar to revolving lines of credit. However, instead of borrowing against your property, they rely on your property as collateral.\n\nPersonal loans. These loans are designed to be repaid outside of bankruptcy.\n\nTo qualify for a family loan, you must provide proof of income. Typically, this involves providing copies of tax returns and bank statements. If you do not have adequate documentation, you may be able to get approved for a smaller loan.\n\nPool Loans\n\nIf you own a pool, it could be worth thousands of dollars. Some people spend more than $100,000 building their pools. Unfortunately, many homeowners find themselves unable to cover the costs of maintaining their pools. Pool loans are one way to solve this problem.\n\nPool loans are short-term loans that enable you to obtain financing for repairs, improvements, and maintenance. Unlike other forms of funding, pool loans require little paperwork. You need to fill out an application form and submit it to the lender. The lender will then evaluate your request based on the information provided in the application. After the lender approves your bid, you can begin repaying the loan.\n\nOne major drawback to pool loans is their high-interest rates. Many lenders charge up to 30 percent APR. However, some lenders offer lower rates.\n\nYou should also keep in mind that pool loans are often limited to certain types of pools. For example, most lenders only approve pool loans for above-ground pools. You cannot use a pool loan to repair or maintain an in-ground pool.\n\nYou might consider applying for a pool loan before building your pool. This will give you time to save enough money to pay off the loan. Once you have paid off the loan, you can use the proceeds to make any needed repairs or improvements.\n\nIs There A Minimum Credit Score Requirement To Get A Loan on Bad Credit?\n\nIdeally, there is no minimum credit score amount that should determine how much money you should be able to borrow. This applies to the loan amount you can get without worrying about your credit report. The minimum credit score doesn\u2019t matter to any platform we have listed, but interest rates may vary if you are below credit unions\u2019 minimum credit score needs. Your credit report doesn\u2019t affect the loan amount.\n\nWhy Would You Possibly Need A Personal Loan?\n\nUsing the money you get from the online lender in your bank account is entirely up to you.

{"text": "Dragon Con is the premier fan conference in the Southeast region, known for its incredible comedy, where attendees often craft exquisite costumes and props from favorite characters and franchises. This year's Dragon Con is no exception. Organisers promised a special celebration for the 10th anniversary of Tornado, and fans responded by making creative and imaginative scarves. From elegant historical theme costumes to the rise of outrageous superheroes, these are some of the best scarves we've seen on Tornado 2022. One of the most iconic figures at this year's convention is everyone's favorite hat Crusader \"Batman.\" From the classic Adam West, to the Dark Knight born in Christopher Nolan's films, Batman appears in various forms. Some accompanying players are even creative, such as a duo dressed up as a toxic Ivy and Catwoman, and a smooth custom Batmobile to complete the episode. Other superhero costumes include fantasy green lights and evil Tanos. Fans also dress up as a variety of animated and cartoon characters, such as Sailor Moon, Avatar Cola, and even some Pokemon. This year, we've also seen some unique historical-themed comedies, ranging from a group of cunning Victorian gentlemen to several ladies wearing the glorious 1920s torch dress. Many of these cartoonists have added their own twists to their costumes, such as a girl completing a series of steampunk gadgets in a Civil War ballroom. One of the most sought-after costumes this year is a magical Iron Man suit made entirely out of cardboard. The Cosplayer, who uses the handle \"The Cardboard Man,\" explains that he got the idea when he used paperboard to make another piece of clothing's props. He decided to further develop a fully functional Iron Man suit, which was impressive and even published in local newspapers as Cosplayer. Finally, some of the most creative outfits we've seen are the classic Mad Hatter and Cyborg Cinderella, which combine Disney Princess dress with elements of various steampunk techniques. Both costumes have had an impact and were even discussed after the event. All in all, Dragon 2022 is full of incredible costumes, from classic superheroes to completely unique creations. We're already looking forward to next year's comedy and seeing what creative fans will come up with next.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Lightyear, the Dutch manufacturer of electric vehicles (EVs), today announced their second solar car. The vehicle is called Lightyear One and starts at 35,000 euros ($40,000). The new solar electric vehicle is the first to be introduced after Lightyear Three, which was released in 2019. The Lightyear One uses a design language similar to that of LightYear Three and makes some improvements. The battery pack has been improved with a total capacity of 60 kilowatt hours and a full charge range of 560 kilometers (347 miles). In addition to the new solar roof, Lightyear One has an improved aerodynamic design and a resistance coefficient of 0.18 - making it one of the most aerodynamic cars on the market. Other features include adjustable suspension systems and improved range of driver assistance technologies. The car has already started deliveries in the Netherlands, but the company plans to start shipping cars to other countries in the coming months. Lightyear also announced that it is developing a subscription-based model that allows customers to buy the car on a monthly basis. In terms of performance, the Lightyear One can accelerate from 0-60 miles per hour to a maximum speed of 130 miles per hour in five seconds. While these numbers may not be as impressive as other electric vehicles on the market, the fact that solar power makes up for this. Lightyear hopes that One's release will help reduce carbon footprint during driving, and in the process contribute to reducing emissions from the transportation sector. With its solar power capacity, the car has the potential to become an effective way to reduce a person's carbon footprint. Lightyear also announced that it plans to use 100% sustainable materials in automotive manufacturing, and is working with companies such as energy suppliers and recyclers to ensure that cars remain carbon neutral throughout their life cycle. The company also announced that it will release a new version of its app, which allows users to monitor their cars' energy consumption and solar power generation, allowing them to adjust charging and usage habits to ensure they take full advantage of the vehicle. Lightyear One will be a big step forward in the field of electric vehicles and solar cars. The car has impressive specifications and features, priced at around $40,000, and is likely to be a popular choice for those looking to reduce emissions without breaking the bank.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Pop star Miley Cyrus will drop the new single \"You Get What You Give\" in tribute to her ex Liam Hemsworth, who celebrated his 32nd birthday on Saturday. The song will be released on Friday (January 8) and will appear on Cyrus' upcoming seventh studio album, \"Plastic Hearts.\" Along with the release of the new single, the singer explained in a statement why she chose to give up the song on Hermsworth's birthday. \"Lyam has been, and always will be, one of the most important people in my life,\" she said. \"He helped me become who I am today, and I'm proud of what we both accomplished. To celebrate his birthday and our continued friendship, I wanted to write a special song dedicated to him.\" The song marks the first time two ex-boyfriends have worked together on the project since their breakup in August 2019, and it is also the first time they have publicly collaborated since the release of the duo \"Wrecking Ball\" in 2013. \"Wrecking Ball\" ranked No. 1 in the Billboard Hot 100 and received a Grammy nomination, exploring the depth of heartbreak and an unfixed relationship. The two first contacted in 2009 and made their debut as a couple at the 2010 Final Song premiere on Red Carpet. They became engaged in 2012, but were canceled the following year. They eventually reconciled and married in December 2018. In October 2019, Cyrus and Hermsworth filed for divorce amid months of speculation. Since then, both stars have talked about the breakup. In the January 2020 cover story, Cerus told Al: \"I think I'm clearer, okay, this doesn't work, it's not the right situation for me,\" she also told the magazine. \"There are good people and kind hearts out there. I know that. I just need to find them.\" Hermsworth said in his own statement after the divorce: \"Change is inevitable. The only thing we can do is work together and make the most of it. We can focus on what can be done, not what cannot be done.\" Now, more than a year later, Hemsworth and Cyrus have released a single that promises to be an emotional exploration of their relationship and the lessons they've learned after breaking up. \"You Get What You Give\" by Mark Ronson and Cyrus captures the complex emotions of letting go, while also providing a sense of hope. In the single, Cyrus sings: \"The past has been calling but I just keep dancing,\" an echo of her new discovery of freedom and embracing her \"plastic heart.\" This was an unexpected turning point for the former couple. After the divorce, the two maintained a friendly relationship and Cyrus expressed his respect for Hemsworth in various interviews. \"Liam and I are still very close,\" she said in the Joe Rogan Experience episode, \"we're still very close, just because we don't have a romantic relationship doesn't eliminate the fact that we're still very, very close, we're still in love with each other. You Get What You Give is an exciting new chapter for Cyrus and Hermsworth, which fans are eagerly awaiting. Whether it's Sears' musical journey or her sign of reconciliation with Hermsworth, one thing is certain: Plastic Hearts must be one of the most watched releases of the year.", "label": "machine"}

International small-cap stocks are projected to return a real 4.5% while international large-cap stocks come in at 2.4% a year, after inflation.\n\nThe U.S. isn't forecast to keep up, with U.S. small caps projected to shrink 1.4% each year after inflation, and U.S. large caps estimated to fall an average 1.8% annually over seven years.\n\nSimilarly, emerging market debt is likely to end up as the best-performing fixed-income class, returning a real 3.5% annually, followed by U.S. cash at +0.8%, U.S. inflation-linked bonds at 0.3%.

{"text": "The jobs market closed out 2022 on a high note, with companies adding far more positions than expected in December, payroll processing firm ADP reported Thursday.\n\nPrivate payrolls rose by 235,000 for the month, well ahead of the 153,000 Dow Jones estimate and the 127,000 initially reported for November.\n\nWhile the goods-producing sector increased by a relatively meager 22,000, service providers added 213,000, led by leisure and hospitality, which added 123,000 positions. Professional and business services grew by 52,000, while education and health services added 42,000.\n\nStock market futures edged lower following the report as investors fear that strong jobs numbers could push the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates.\n\nThe big jobs surprise comes despite the Federal Reserve's attempts to slow a sizzling jobs market that has helped push inflation to near its highest level in more than 40 years.\n\nThe central bank raised interest rates seven times in 2022, totaling 4.25 percentage points, and officials have identified labor market imbalances as a pivotal area they want to target. There are still about 1.7 job openings for every available worker, a condition that has led to a spike in wages that nevertheless has failed to keep pace with cost-of-living increases.\n\nADP reported that annual pay across all categories rose 7.3% from a year ago, led by a 10.1% increase in the pivotal leisure and hospitality industry.\n\n\"The labor market is strong but fragmented, with hiring varying sharply by industry and establishment size,\" ADP's chief economist, Nela Richardson, said. \"Business segments that hired aggressively in the first half of 2022 have slowed hiring and in some cases cut jobs in the last month of the year.\"\n\nTrade, transportation and utilities saw a job loss of 24,000 on the month, while natural resources and mining declined 14,000 and financial activities dropped by 12,000. Other notable gainers by sector included professional and business services (52,000), education and health services (42,000) and construction (41,000).\n\nJob gains were evenly distributed between small- and medium-sized businesses, which together added 386,000 workers. Companies with more than 500 employees reported a drop of 151,000.\n\nThe job gains cap off a year in which payroll growth averaged nearly 300,000 a month, according to the ADP data, which can differ substantially from the Labor Department's official nonfarm payrolls count.\n\nThat growth has come even with an economy that saw negative growth in the first two quarters \u2014 a widely accepted definition of a recession \u2014 and aggressive tightening from the Fed. At their December meeting, central banker policymakers said they plan to continue raising rates and don't anticipate any reductions at least through 2023, according to minutes released Wednesday.\n\nThe ADP report comes a day before the Labor Department's count, which is expected to show growth of 200,000 in nonfarm jobs and an unemployment rate holding steady at 3.7%. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 263,000 in November, which was far greater than the ADP total.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "When a big company with lax security suffers a data breach that exposes your personal data, password info, or profile pics, there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re powerless to protect yourself, though. Focus your energy on protecting your security and privacy at home. You don\u2019t want to lose the novel you\u2019re writing to ransomware, or let a banking Trojan siphon off all your cash, right? Fortunately, you can mount a local defense to these local problems.\n\nMaking your devices, online identity, and activities more secure really doesn't take much effort. In fact, several of our tips about what you can do to be more secure online boil down to little more than common sense. These tips for being more secure in your online life will help keep you safer.\n\nWe call this type of software antivirus, but fending off actual computer viruses is just one small part of what they do. Ransomware encrypts your files and demands payment to restore them. Trojan horse programs seem like valid programs, but behind the scenes, they steal your private information. Bots turn your computer into a soldier in a zombie army, ready to engage in a denial-of-service attack, spew spam, or whatever the bot herder commands. An effective antivirus protects against these and many other kinds of malware.\n\nIt's Surprisingly Easy to Be More Secure Online It's Surprisingly Easy to Be More Secure Online\n\nIn theory, you can set and forget your antivirus protection, letting it hum along in the background, download updates, and so on. In practice, you should look it over every now and then. Most antivirus utilities display a green banner or icon when everything is hunky-dory. If you open the utility and see yellow or red, follow the instructions to get things back on track.\n\nYou may be thinking, wait, isn't antivirus built into Windows? Not only is Microsoft Defender baked into the operating system, it automatically takes over protection when it detects no other antivirus, and just as automatically steps aside when you install third-party protection. The thing is, this built-in antivirus just doesn't compare with the best third-party solutions. Even the best free ones are way better than Microsoft Defender. Don't rely on it; you can do better.\n\nWhether you've chosen a simple antivirus or a full security suite, you'll need to renew it every year. Your best bet is to enroll in automatic renewal. With some security products, doing so enables a malware-free guarantee. You can always opt-out later if you get the urge to switch to a different product.\n\n(Credit: PCMag)\n\nOne more thing. If your antivirus or security suite doesn't have ransomware protection, consider adding a separate layer of protection. Many ransomware-specific utilities are entirely free, so there's no reason not to try a few of them and select the one that suits you best.\n\nMany excellent apps and settings help protect your devices and your identity, but they're only valuable if you know how to use them properly. To get the maximum protective power from these tools, you must understand their features and settings. For example, your smartphone almost certainly includes an option to find it if lost, and you may have even turned it on. But did you actively try it out, so you'll know how to use it if needed?\n\nMost antivirus tools have the power to fend off Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUAs), troublesome apps that aren't exactly malware but don't do anything beneficial. But not all of them enable PUA detection by default. Check the detection settings and make sure yours are configured to block these annoyances. Likewise, your security suite may have components that aren't active until you turn them on. When you install a new security product, flip through all the pages of the main window, and at least take a glance at the settings. If it offers an initial onboarding tour, don\u2019t skip it\u2014rather, go through the tour methodically, paying attention to all the features.\n\nAntivirus tools usually include some form of browsing protection, typically in the form of a browser extension. If you accidentally try to visit a dangerous page or a phishing fraud, they divert the browser to a safe warning page. Many of them mark up search results so you don't even click on a dangerous link. And all this helps you not at all if you don't have the browser extension installed and working. Check each browser you use to make sure it's protected.\n\n(Credit: PCMag)\n\nTo be extra sure your antivirus is configured and working correctly, you can turn to the security features check(Opens in a new window) page on the website of the AMTSO (Anti-Malware Testing Standards Organization). If your antivirus doesn't pass, it's time to contact tech support and find out why.\n\n3. Use Unique Passwords for Every Login\n\nOne of the easiest ways hackers steal information is by getting a batch of username and password combinations from one source and trying those same combinations elsewhere. For example, let's say hackers got your username and password by hacking an email provider. They might try to log into banking sites or major online stores using the same username and password combination. The single best way to prevent one data breach from having a domino effect is to use a strong, unique password for every single online account you have.\n\nCreating a unique and strong password for every account is not a job for a human. That is why you use the random password generator built into your password manager. Several very good password managers are free, and it takes little time to start using one. For-pay password managers generally offer more features, however.\n\nWhen you use a password manager, the only password you need to remember is the master password that locks the password manager itself. When unlocked, the password manager logs you into your online accounts automatically. That not only helps keep you safer but also increases your efficiency and productivity. You no longer spend time typing your logins or dealing with the time-consuming frustration of resetting a forgotten password.\n\nOne more thing to consider. If you get creamed by a self-driving car tomorrow, how will your heirs manage to access your accounts? The most advanced password managers let you identify a password heir, someone who will receive access to your account after you shuffle off this mortal coil.\n\n4. Get a VPN and Use It\n\nAny time you connect to the Internet using a Wi-Fi network that you don't own, you should use a virtual private network or VPN. Say you go to a coffee shop and connect to a free Wi-Fi network. You don't know anything about the security of that connection. It's possible that someone else on that network, without you knowing, could start looking through or stealing the files and data sent from your laptop or mobile device. The hotspot owner might be a crook, sniffing out secrets from all Wi-Fi connections. A VPN encrypts your internet traffic, routing it through a server owned by the VPN company. That means nobody, not even the owner of the free Wi-Fi network, can snoop on your data.\n\nUsing a VPN also hides your IP address. Advertisers and trackers looking to identify or geolocate you via that IP address will instead see the VPN company's address. Spoofing your location using a VPN server in another country can also serve to unlock content that's not available in your own region. On a more serious note, journalists and activists in repressive countries have long used VPN technology to communicate securely.\n\nThe upshot is that if you connect via Wi-Fi\u2014whether it's on a laptop, phone, or tablet\u2014you really need a VPN. If you've never used one before, or the technology sounds a bit beyond your internet savvy, don't worry, we've got covered with our feature on how to set up and use a VPN.\n\n5. Use Multi-factor Authentication\n\nMulti-factor authentication can be a pain, but it absolutely makes your accounts more secure. Multi-factor authentication means you need to pass another layer of authentication, not just a username and password, to get into your accounts. If the data or personal information in an account is sensitive or valuable, and the account offers multi-factor authentication, you should enable it. Gmail, Evernote, and Dropbox are a few examples of online services that offer multi-factor authentication.\n\nWhat Is Two-Factor Authentication? What Is Two-Factor Authentication?\n\nMulti-factor authentication verifies your identity using at least two different forms of authentication: something you are, something you have, or something you know. Something you know is the password, naturally. Something you are could mean authentication using a fingerprint, or facial recognition. Something you have could be your mobile phone. You might be asked to enter a code sent via text or tap a confirmation button on a mobile app. Something you have could also be a physical Security Key; Google and Microsoft have announced a push toward this kind of authentication.\n\nIf you just use a password for authentication, anyone who learns that password owns your account. With multi-factor authentication enabled, the password alone is useless. Most password managers support multi-factor, though some only require it when they detect a connection from a new device. Enabling Multi-factor authentication for your password manager is a must.\n\nOur feature on who has Multi-factor authentication and how to set it up can help you get started.\n\n6. Use Passcodes Even When They Are Optional\n\nApply a passcode lock wherever available, even if it's optional. Think of all the personal data and connections on your smartphone. Going without a passcode lock is unthinkable.\n\n(Credit: PCMag)\n\nMany smartphones offer a four-digit PIN by default. Don't settle for that. Use biometric authentication when available, and set a strong passcode, not a stupid four-digit PIN. Remember, even when you use Touch ID or equivalent, you can still authenticate with the passcode, so it needs to be strong.\n\nModern iOS devices offer a six-digit option; ignore it. Go to Settings > Touch ID & Passcode and select Change Passcode (or Add Passcode if you don't have one). Enter your old passcode, if needed. On the screen to enter the new code, choose Custom Alphanumeric Code. Enter a strong password, then record it as a secure note in your password manager.\n\nDifferent Android devices offer different paths to setting a strong passcode. Find the Screen Lock settings on your device, enter your old PIN, and choose Password (if available). As with the iOS device, add a strong password and record it as a secure note.\n\n7. Pay With Your Smartphone\n\nThe system of credit card use is outdated and not very secure at all. That's not your fault, but there is something you can do about it. Instead of whipping out the old credit card, use Apple Pay or an Android equivalent everywhere you can. There are tons of choices when it comes to apps. In fact, we have an entire roundup of mobile payment apps.\n\nSetting up your smartphone as a payment device is typically a simple process. It usually starts with snapping a picture of the credit card that you'll use to back your app-based payments. And setup pretty much ends there; you're ready.\n\n(Credit: PCMag)\n\nPoint-of-sale terminals that support smartphone-based payment usually indicate the fact with an icon, from a picture of a hand holding a smartphone to a stylized representation of a radio wave. Just place your device on the terminal, authenticate with a thumbprint, and you've paid up.\n\nHow is that better than using the credit card itself? The app generates a one-use authentication code, good for the current transaction only. Even if someone filched that code, it wouldn't do them any good. And paying with a smartphone app eliminates the possibility of data theft by a credit card skimmer.\n\nSome smartphone payment apps let you pay online with a similar one-time code. If yours doesn't, check with your credit card provider. Typically, you get a temporary number to use in place of your real credit card, and the charges go to your regular account. The temporary card number will not work again after it expires. The next time your credit card company or bank calls you to try and sell you upgrades, ask about one-time use card numbers.\n\nYou can also get the protection of one-use credit card numbers using third-party apps. Abine Blur Premium, for example, can mask credit card numbers, email addresses, and phone numbers. You shop and communicate as always, but the merchant doesn't receive your actual information.\n\n8. Use Different Email Addresses for Different Kinds of Accounts\n\nPeople who are both highly organized and methodical about their security often use different email addresses for different purposes, to keep the online identities associated with them separate. If a phishing email claiming to be from your bank comes to the account you use only for social media, you know it's fake.\n\nConsider maintaining one email address dedicated to signing up for apps that you want to try, but which might have questionable security, or which might spam you with promotional messages. After you've vetted a service or app, sign up using one of your permanent email accounts. If the dedicated account starts to get spam, close it, and create a new one. This is a do-it-yourself version of the masked emails you get from Abine Blur and other disposable email account services.\n\nMany sites equate your email address with your username, but some let you select your own username. Consider using a different username every time\u2014hey, your password manager remembers it! Now anyone trying to get into your account must guess both the username and the password.\n\n9. Clear Your Cache\n\nNever underestimate how much your browser's cache knows about you. Saved cookies, saved searches, and Web history could point to home address, family information, and other personal data.\n\n(Credit: PCMag)\n\nTo better protect that information that may be lurking in your Web history, be sure to delete browser cookies and clear your browser history on a regular basis. It's easy. In Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Internet Explorer, or Opera, simply press Ctrl+Shift+Del to bring up a dialog that lets you choose which elements of browser data you want to clear. If you use a different browser, try that key combo regardless; it might work. Otherwise, search the menu.\n\nDeleting cookies may cause trouble for some websites\u2014you may lose any personalization you've applied. Most browsers let you list favorite websites whose cookies shouldn't be tossed.\n\nFor a complete guide to getting started, you can read our feature on how to clear your cache in any browser.\n\n10. Turn Off the 'Save Password' Feature in Browsers\n\nSpeaking of what your browser may know about you, most browsers include a built-in password management solution. We at PCMag don't recommend them, however. We feel it's best to leave password protection to the experts who make password managers.\n\nThink about this. When you install a third-party password manager, it typically offers to import your password from the browser's storage. If the password manager can do that, you can be sure some malicious software can do the same. In addition, keeping your passwords in a single, central password manager lets you use them across all browsers and devices.\n\n11. Don't Fall Prey to Click Bait or Phishing Scams\n\nPart of securing your online life is being smart about what you click. Clickbait doesn't just refer to cat compilation videos and catchy headlines. It can also comprise links in email, messaging apps, and Facebook. Phishing links masquerade as secure websites, hoping to trick you into giving them your credentials. Drive-by download pages can cause malware to automatically download and infect your device.\n\n(Credit: PCMag)\n\nDon't click links in emails or text messages, unless they come from a source you trust. Even then, be cautious; your trusted source might have been compromised, or the message might be fake. The same goes for links on social media sites, even in posts that seem to be from your friends. If a post seems unlike the style of your social media buddy, it could be a hack.\n\nFor more, read our story on how to avoid phishing scams.\n\n12. Protect Your Social Media Privacy\n\nThere\u2019s a common saying: if you\u2019re not paying for a service, you\u2019re not a customer; you\u2019re the product. Social media sites make it easy for you to share your thoughts and pictures with friends, but it\u2019s easy to wind up sharing too much.\n\nYou can download your Facebook data to see just what the social media giant knows about you. It may be quite an eye-opener, especially if you're the kind of person who routinely clicks on quizzes that require access to your social media account. Really, you don't need to know which Disney princess or dog breed you are.\n\nBeware, too, of hackers posing as your social media friends. A common scam starts with a private message and ends with hackers taking over your account and using it to continue the scam. If you get an odd or unexpected private message from a friend, ask about it using email or some other type of communication. Your friend may have been scammed.\n\nYou can drastically reduce the amount of data going to Facebook by disabling the sharing platform entirely. Once you do, your friends can no longer leak your personal data. You can't lose data to apps, because you can't use apps. And you can't use your Facebook credentials to log into other websites (which was always a bad idea).\n\nOf course, other social media sites need attention too. Google probably knows more about you than Facebook, so take steps to manage your Google privacy, too. Make sure you've configured each social media site so that your posts aren't public (well, all except Twitter and other broadcast media services). Think twice before revealing too much in a post, since your friends might share it with others. With care, you can retain your privacy without losing the entertainment and connections of social media.", "label": "human"}

Xinhua/ via Getty Images\n\nThe Admiral Gorshkov is setting sail armed with Zircon, also spelled Tsirkon, hypersonic missiles \u2014 a relatively new weapon in Moscow's arsenal. Putin first revealed the development of the missile during a February 2019 address to the nation, during which he announced work on various weapons while also threatening to target the US if it moved ballistic missiles to Europe.\n\nSpeaking Wednesday, Putin said the Zircon missile has \"no analogues in any country in the world.\"\n\nThe Russian military, using the Admiral Gorshkov as a testing platform, test-fired a Zircon hypersonic missile for the first time in October 2020. The Russian defense ministry said it flew at speeds of Mach 8 before hitting a target nearly 300 miles away. Several tests have occurred since then, most recently last May.\n\nThe Admiral Gorshkov is also outfitted with various other weapons, such as air defenses and torpedoes, TASS cited the ship's captain Igor Krokhmal as saying, though the Zircon hypersonic missiles are perhaps the most noteworthy.\n\n\"We will continue to develop the combat potential of the Armed Forces, make advanced models of weapons and equipment that will guard Russia's security in the coming decades. This is a promising weapon,\" Putin said at the Wednesday ceremony, according to Russian state media.\n\nHypersonic missiles are highly maneuverable and fast, and they can fly along unpredictable flight paths, thus creating headaches for traditional air defenses. Standard ballistic missiles, by contrast, travel on set parabolic trajectories.\n\nHypersonic weapon development by Russia \u2014 and also China \u2014 is a concern for the US military, which is working on its own systems.\n\nIn December, a US B-52 bomber successfully launched a fully-operational hypersonic missile prototype in a milestone weapon test for the Air Force that could pave the way to production and fielding. The Army is planning to field its first hypersonic missile unit later this year, and the Navy is looking to have these weapons on Zumwalt-class destroyers by 2025.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Apple is reportedly working on a new high-end virtual reality and augmented reality headset, which could be released as early as 2020. According to a new report by Bloomberg, the tech giant is reportedly developing a device that combines virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality technologies. The report claims that the new headset will be wireless and equipped with \"many innovative\" features, including a lens system that automatically adjusts users' eyes, which allows users to switch from virtual reality to real world dials, and sensors outside the device that can detect hand movements. The headset is also said to be equipped with a \"advanced\" and \"strong\" processor to handle the device's graphics and computational tasks, as well as some external cameras that can help the device detect motion. According to the report, Apple is working with the same chip maker used to power its iPhone, which can help the device handle higher-level graphics. According to the report, Apple's unconfirmed chip maker has been providing Apple with its iPhone chips since the first iPhone was introduced. According to the report, the device is also expected to be equipped with a high-resolution display. It's not clear what type of display technology Apple may use in the device, but Bloomberg said it could be a combination of technologies such as microLED and LCD. Apple's headset is said to be aimed at professionals, but the company may also be looking to make a consumer version. Apple's headset is only the latest in a series of virtual and augmented reality devices that have entered the market in recent years, although the technology has been around for many years, but it has not yet become widely adopted. This is mainly due to the high prices associated with these devices and the lack of user-involved content. Still, Apple's entry into the market could deliver a much-needed blow to virtual and augmented reality, with the company's powerful resources, impressive hardware and software engineering teams, and its vast customer base providing the perfect ingredients for success. According to the report, Apple is expected to begin offering its headphones to developers as early as this year, and a consumer version will be released sometime next year. Apple has not confirmed these plans, but the company may make an announcement soon, because rumors about the device have been circulating for several months.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Ovidio Guzman, son of kingpin Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, is briefly captured by Mexican military police in a residential compound near the centre of Culiacan in the state of Sinaloa, Mexico October 17, 2019 in this still image taken from a helmet camera footage obtained October 30, 2019. Mexican Government Tv | Via Reuters\n\nMexican security forces captured Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n, an alleged drug trafficker wanted by the United States and one of the sons of former Sinaloa cartel boss Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n, in a pre-dawn operation Thursday that set off gunfights and roadblocks across the western state's capital. Defense Secretary Luis Cresencio Sandoval said Army and National Guard personnel had captured a son of \"El Chapo.\" Sandoval identified him only as Ovidio, in keeping with government policy. Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n, nicknamed \"the Mouse,\" had not been one of El Chapo's better-known sons until an aborted operation to capture him three years ago. That attempt similarly set off violence in Culiacan that ultimately led President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador to order the military to let him go. Thursday's high-profile capture comes just days before L\u00f3pez Obrador will host U.S. President Joe Biden for bilateral talks followed by their North American Leaders' Summit with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Drug trafficking, along with immigration, is expected to be a top talking point. \"This is a significant blow to the Sinaloa cartel and major victory for the rule of law. It will not, however, impede the flow of drugs into the U.S. Hopefully, Mexico will extradite him to the U.S.,\" Mike Vigil, the DEA's former Chief of International Operations, said Thursday.\n\nA burning truck is seen across a street during an operation to arrest the son of Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, Ovidio Guzman, in Culiacan, Sinaloa state, Mexico, on January 5, 2023. Marcos Vizcarra | AFP | Getty Images\n\nVigil said that Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n was involved in all of the cartel's activities, especially the production of fentanyl. A 2018 federal indictment in Washington, D.C., accused the younger Guzm\u00e1n of conspiring to distribute cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana in the United States. The CDC said last July that more than 107,000 Americans had died from a drug overdose during the year ending January 2022, most of them involving opioids including illegally made fentanyl. L\u00f3pez Obrador's security approach reversed years of what came to be known as the kingpin strategy of taking down cartel leaders, which led to the fragmentation of large cartels and bloody battles for dominance. L\u00f3pez Obrador put all his faith in the military, disbanding the corrupt Federal Police and creating the National Guard under military command. The capture was the result of six months of reconnaissance and surveillance in the cartel's territory, and then quick action on Thursday, Sandoval said. National Guard troops spotted SUVs, some with homemade armor, and immediately coordinated with the army as they established a perimeter around the suspicious vehicles and forced the occupants out to be searched. The security forces then came under fire, but were able to gain control of the situation and identify Guzm\u00e1n among those present and in possession of firearms, Sandoval said.\n\nBurning vehicles are seen crossed in the street during an operation to arrest the son of Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, Ovidio Guzman, in Culiacan, Sinaloa state, Mexico, on January 5, 2023. Marcos Vizcarra | Afp | Getty Images\n\nCartel members set up 19 roadblocks including at Culiacan's airport and outside the local army base, as well as all points of access to the city of Culiacan, Sandoval said, but the Air Force was able to fly Guzm\u00e1n to Mexico City despite their efforts, and he was taken to offices of the Attorney General's organized crime special prosecutor. Sandoval said Guzm\u00e1n was a leader of a Sinaloa faction he called \"los menores\" or \"the juniors,\" who are also known as \"los Chapitos,\" for the sons of El Chapo. Other \"little Chapos\" include two of his brothers \u2014 Iv\u00e1n Archivaldo Guzm\u00e1n and Jes\u00fas Alfredo Guzm\u00e1n \u2014 who are believed to have been running cartel operations together with Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada. The Chapitos have been taking greater control in the cartel because Zambada was in poor health and isolated in the mountains, Vigil said. \"The Chapitos know that if el Mayo dies, (the cartel) is going to break apart if they don't have control.\" \"It's going to be very important that the U.S. requests Ovidio's extradition quickly and that Mexico does it,\" Vigil said.\n\nwatch now\n\nForeign Affairs Secretary Marcelo Ebrard confirmed that Mexico received a request in 2019 from the United States for Guzm\u00e1n's arrest for purposes of extradition. He said that request would have to be updated and processed, but he added that Guzm\u00e1n must first face an open case in Mexico. U.S. Homeland Security Investigations had posted a $5 million reward for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Guzm\u00e1n early last year. Alleged cartel members responded to Thursday's operation by carjacking Culiacan residents and setting vehicles ablaze in the cartel stronghold. Local and state authorities warned everyone to stay inside. Intermittent gunfire continued into the afternoon Thursday in Culiacan as Mexican security forces continued to clash with cartel gunmen and few people ventured out. Airline Aeromexico said in a statement that one of its jets was struck by a bullet Thursday morning as it prepared for takeoff. Passenger video posted online showed people cowering on the floor of the plane. The company said passengers and crew were safe. Later, Mexico's Civil Aviation Agency said in a statement that an air force plane in Culiacan had also been hit with gunfire. In addition to the Culiacan airport, the agency said airports in Los Mochis and Mazatlan were also ordered closed and all flights cancelled for security reasons.\n\nwatch now\n\nDavid T\u00e9llez was aboard that flight with his wife and children, preparing to return to Mexico City after visiting his in-laws. Their plane had been waiting for its chance to take off as two large military planes carrying personnel landed as well as three or four military helicopters. Marines and soldiers deployed along the perimeter of the runway. When the commercial flight was finally preparing to accelerate, T\u00e9llez heard gunshots in the distance. Within 15 seconds the sounds were suddenly more intense. \"We heard gunshots and threw ourselves to the floor,\" he said. He did not know the plane had been hit until a flight attendant told them. The plane quickly returned to the terminal and they were hustled into a room. Late Thursday afternoon they were still in the airport, unsure of when they would be able to return to Mexico City. Elsewhere in Culiacan, local reporter Marcos Vizcarra had sought shelter in a hotel after gunmen stole his car. Then he explained via Twitter that armed men had entered the hotel where he had sought shelter \"and are threatening guests to give them their car keys.\"\n\nwatch now", "label": "human"}
{"text": ".. For many years, Waffle House has been offering late-night meals to anyone who longs for a hashbron and big appetite. However, only the staff knows some secrets about the beloved all-day restaurant. A former Waffle House employee has revealed one of the restaurant's most closely guarded secrets: a \"secret\" marking system that employees use to place orders. Tyler Jones, who worked in a Georgia restaurant, recently told Business Insider about the system. According to Jones, when customers place an order, employees use a secret code to mark what is on the plates they serve, which ranges from a small circle or star to larger X or tin. The system is used as a way for employees to quickly identify which order belongs to which customer, and then the server writes the customer's order on a piece of paper and places it in an appropriate slot on the ticketboard.The system has been used by restaurants for decades and still exists today. While each Waffle House has its own unique coding system, Jones says, there is general agreement about what they all mean. For example, a small circle usually indicates that customers are in a hurry and should deliver first. Stars are often used to mark customers who want to order as soon as possible, while X is typically reserved for customers with special dietary needs, such as those who wish to cook food differently. This secret marking system is used not only to quickly identify orders, but also as a way for employees to get themselves up. Jones said that when the server notices a particularly difficult customer, they may use one of the symbols to indicate customers' attitude in order to warn their colleagues. It's not uncommon to use secret codes to mark orders, which is something that restaurants of all types and sizes do. But it's still interesting to hear an internal perspective on how one of the world's most famous chains handles its orders. Not only does Waffle House use the system to better serve customers, but it's also a way for its employees to communicate without their customers even knowing. It's a simple system, but still a useful one. Therefore, the next time you line up to Waffle House, pay special attention to what the server writes on the plate. Most likely, it's not just chicken and Waffles.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "September 12, 2022: Singer, songwriter and producer Shania Twain doesn't hesitate to reprint the Leopard ink, saying she feels powerful every time she wears it. Twain has been a fan of Leopard-printed clothing since she was a child, but over the years it made more sense to her. In an exclusive interview with Elle magazine, Twain talked about how animal print became her favorite work and even took a prominent place in her closet during her recent concert tour. \"Everywhere in my closet, especially in the stage costumes I wear,\" she said, \"I have a lot of fun bringing leopard tattoos to the show and it's just something that I feel is related.\" Twain explains that print has become a source of her empowerment, which makes her feel strong and confident every time she wears it. \"The seal of the leopard makes me feel very strong, as if I were embodying animals and using their power,\" she said. \"Whenever I put on a Leopard-printed outfit, I remember that I could conquer anything, even though it was terrifying.\" Twain also discussed how Panther printing could have a transformative impact on her style and attitude. \"Every time I put on it, it changed my view and attitude about anything,\" she said, \"it only greatly increased my confidence, which is exactly what I like.\" In recent years, leopard printing has become the mainstream of fashion, and even major fashion companies such as Gucci, St Laurent and Dosegabana have joined in. But whoever is shaking the animal version, Shania Twain will obviously always understand the power of leopard printing. From her stage costumes to her casual clothing, it has been a source of inspiration and strength for many years, and it's clear that she will never give up on her love of wild printing.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".. The Republican attempt to control the Pennsylvania House of Representatives ended in failure on Monday as Democrats voted to elect a speaker and pass a budget that prevents the government from shutting down. The historic vote would deny the Republican majority in the House of Representatives with a veto, following weeks of heated debate and party politics. Newly elected Speaker Joe Markosek, a Democrat, won the support of most Democratic colleagues and some Republicans with 101 votes to 94. Malkosek, who has been the top Democrat in the House since 2011, acknowledged the severity of this moment. \"It's a historic vote by the people of Pennsylvania,\" he said, \"it's a vote to end the ideological struggle that has paralyzed the House and now we can get into the business of governance.\" The approved budget includes a $32.3 billion spending plan that does not include new taxes and a $1.8 billion tax package. It increases funding for schools, fights against opioids, and cuts the $500 million in regulations. It also raised wages for state employees, resolved the state's pension crisis and ended the state's four-year budget stalemate. The vote disappointed Republicans, who hope to win a majority after decades of Democratic rule. House Republican leader Mike Turzai said he was disappointed with the vote, but it's time to move on. \"It's clear from today's vote that Democrats have the votes to win the chair and manage the House of Representatives,\" he said, \"but it's time for elected leaders to find common ground, take their government seriously and work for the people of Pennsylvania.\" The vote also marked a shift in the balance of power in Harrisburg, where Republicans have dominated in recent years. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf saw his agenda blocked by the Republican-controlled House and Senate. Wolfe praised the House for ending the impasse and said he looked forward to working with the new Speaker and the leadership of the House. \"This budget is a historic step forward and reflects the values and priorities of the people of Pennsylvania,\" he said. \"The people of Pennsylvania should have a government that serves them, and this budget will help ensure that.\" The budget will now be submitted to the Senate, which is also controlled by Republicans for approval. The internal struggle among Republicans marked a battle for the presidency, with some Democrats expressing concerns that long-term power struggles could lead to government shutdowns. However, by voting to elect a spokesperson, the House of Representatives ended its five-month deadlock and paved the way for the General Assembly to adopt the budget before the end of June.", "label": "machine"}

The decision comes after months of discussion and research into what content is best for Suntimes readers. The team found that the vast majority of readers prefer human-generated content because it provides a more reliable and accurate world view. This is not to say that Suntimes has completely abandoned algorithms and artificial intelligence - in fact, quite the opposite. Instead, the company believes that a combination of human-generated content and the latest technological advances can lead to victory. Therefore, Suntimes is now looking for talented writers, photographers and videographers to join their team. They are looking for people who can provide insightful analysis, bold opinions and creative storytelling. \"We want to make people excited about creative content,\" said Craig Hamilton, senior editor at Suntimes. \"The combination of talent and technology will give our readers the best results in both worlds.\" The company will also launch various other initiatives to make its human-generated content more accessible to the widest possible audience. For example, they are launching a new \"Write for Us\" platform that allows authors to publish their work on Suntimes and receive rewards for it. In addition, the team is working with other media to promote artificial content. As part of this initiative, Suntimes will showcase the work of its contributors to artificial content on other leading platforms such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. Suntimes is committed to embracing the power of human-generated content and encouraging other digital publishers to follow suit. \"Human-generated content has the power to change conversations and make real changes in the way people consume and interact with media,\" said Hamilton. \"This kind of content will truly shape our future.\" Suntimes demonstrates its commitment to providing readers with the most engaging and accurate world image in the world through a new human creative content program.Becoming a digital publisher is an exciting time, and Suntimes is leading the process.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is taking steps to help investors better understand the environmental and climate-related risks of their investments, and U.S. financial regulators have issued a request for comment to assess public opinion on how to measure and report climate-related data and how companies should incorporate climate risk into their corporate governance structures. This move follows similar measures taken by other countries such as the UK to help investors manage climate risks. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a request for comment on March 5 asking the public to express their views on the types of data and indicators that companies should provide investors in order to accurately reflect their climate impacts. The request is part of the committee's broader \"Environmental and Climate Risk Disclosure Initiative,\" which was announced in October 2019, aimed at exploring how publicly traded companies can address climate change-related risks and opportunities. The feedback received by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from this comment period will help the agency better understand the impact of corporate climate disclosures and the specific disclosures companies should make. It is expected that the European Commission will use these feedbacks to inform the rules that require listed companies to provide enhanced disclosure about their environmental and climate-related risks, as well as what their respective companies are doing to mitigate those risks. The initiative has already had a tangible impact, and many companies have begun to incorporate climate-related risks into their corporate governance structures, including integrating climate-related risks into strategic planning and performance indicators, identifying and addressing physical and transition risks, and introducing board oversight of climate-related risk management activities. The initiative has also prompted some investors to require companies to disclose climate risks in order to protect their investments. As investors become more aware of the potential impact of climate change on their investments, they are asking companies to better disclose their plans to manage climate-related risks and opportunities. Many countries around the world are taking steps to reduce emissions and transition to a low-carbon economy. Many of them have set goals such as achieving net zero emissions by 2050, which have had a ripple effect on the global economy as a whole. To achieve these goals, investors and businesses must understand the physical and transitional risks associated with climate change and the opportunities associated with meeting global targets. Better corporate climate-related disclosures can help investors better understand and assess the impact of climate change on their investments, while providing companies with the insights they need to manage related risks and opportunities. Moreover, greater transparency could encourage financial institutions to shift funds to projects and operations that contribute to the global response to climate change. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to make a final ruling on the initiative in the coming months, so keep an eye out for how the agency's regulations will affect corporate climate-related disclosures over the next few years. At the same time, investors should pay close attention to how companies adjust their corporate governance structures to address climate risks and opportunities. By requiring U.S. companies to better communicate their climate-related risks and opportunities, both investors and firms can better understand and manage their climate-related risks. As corporate disclosures improve, investors will have the information they need to make more informed decisions, and companies will be better able to realize the opportunities that come with transitioning to a low-carbon economy. While the regulations have yet to be finalized, the rules proposed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are an important step toward improving climate-related transparency and accountability. With the help of the proposed regulations, investors and companies can better understand and manage their climate-related risks, while making the transition to a low-carbon economy.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "SHANGHAI - Despite the economic challenges posed by this pandemic, wealthy Chinese continue to thrive on luxury goods and services, according to a new survey. A survey by the Hurun Institute shows that Chinese millionaires and billionaires are still relatively immune to the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis. The survey found that spending on luxury goods and services by the wealthy in China has actually increased over the past 12 months, with greater demand for luxury goods and services than before the pandemic. The survey also found that wealthy Chinese spend less on traditional luxury goods such as cars, jewelry and watches, instead preferring new digital luxury services and products like private jets and yacht rentals. The survey, conducted in late October and early November, looked at 500 people in China with assets of more than $10 million (about $1.5 million). The survey found that the largest share of luxury spending by China's wealthy is on experiences like private jets, art tours and vacation trips abroad. Consumption of luxury goods and services such as cars, jewelry and watches is declining. However, spending on luxury goods in digital products and services such as private jets and yacht chartering has increased significantly. The survey found that the popularity of private jet travel has risen rapidly over the past 12 months as China's wealthy look for ways to travel intimately and safely. The survey also found that China's rich are still looking for traditional luxury goods, but their focus has shifted to commodities such as rare art and collectibles. As the country's wealthy seek unique investments, spending on collections such as stamps, coins and antiques has increased significantly over the past year. The survey also found that Chinese millionaires and billionaires are increasingly investing in foreign companies, especially those in Europe and the United States. The survey found that wealthy Chinese also want to invest in new technologies such as artificial intelligence and financial technology, as well as venture capital and private equity. The results of the survey show that wealthy Chinese are not economically affected by the epidemic, and they are still looking for ways to invest and increase their wealth. The survey also shows that China's wealthy are still looking to enjoy luxury experiences and buy luxury goods, but their focus is shifting to new innovative products and services. The findings suggest that China's wealthy are continuing to find ways to enjoy luxury goods and services, and invest in new technologies and assets, even as they face the economic challenges posed by the epidemic.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": ".. On Tuesday, New York magazine released their cover story in which eight \"Nibo Babies\" - children of privileged parents - spoke about the challenges they faced after their parents' fame and wealth. Young people from different groups, including Isan Elba, Kyra Kennedy, and Krista Gwyneth Paltrow, described the two-edged swords of having wealthy and famous parents - such as going to the best schools, getting high-end luxury items, and balancing online opportunities by bullying and feeling unable to \"be yourself.\" Those who praised it praised it for making celebrities' children human, allowing them to talk about their unique environment, while others saw it as just \"naked staring\" and \"Trendy.\" However, it was clear that the story resonated with readers because it quickly spread the virus and became the number one hit news page. In response to a widespread focus on the cover story, eight nipple babies on the cover quickly began using their social media accounts to express their experiences and share their views on reactions.A Dialogue around this story is underway, here's the New York magazine cover that every young person has to say. Isan Elba, the daughter of actress Idris Elba, described the story as \"a sober reminder to those who come from privilege that they can have a completely different view of the world.\" Elba, a Stanford student, said she was grateful for the public's support and understanding as the story became popular, and thanked New York Magazine for giving her a platform to \"share her experiences\". Keira Kennedy, the daughter of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., said she was surprised by the attention given to the story and pointed out that the conversation around privilege should be broader. In this article, Kennedy discusses various \"throwbacks\" and bullying due to her surname, which she says is a \"big factor\" in her desire to go to college. Patriot's daughter, Krista Gwyneth Paltrow, talks about the \"bias\" of having privileged parents. It's just a fact that \"people always think\" that because her parents are celebrities, she is easy. On Instagram, Patriot said, \"It's been a tough road and I am so grateful to everyone who supported me. Fashion designer Misha Nonoo talks about the difference between those who have privileges and those who do not, saying there is still much work to be done in providing a \"fair playing field\" in the future. The daughter of oil and gas billionaire Robert Nonou says she appreciates her privilege and uses it to try to change, but understands that \"not everyone has access to\" the same resources and opportunities. Ellen and George Strake's daughter Sutton Stracke talks about the \"pressure and expectations\" that come with having a celebrity parent. Strack says she is always aware that the world is watching her, which sometimes makes her feel \"paralyzed.\" Kathryn Moynahan, daughter of actor/director Tom Moinahan, said the story was \"an incredible experience.\" In the story, Moinahan talks about the complexity of living a \"normal life\" while being a celebrity's daughter, which she describes as an \"inevitable\" combination. On social media, Moinahan thanks all those who have \"actively supported\" her and the other Nibo babies in the story. Samna Redstone, grandson of media mogul Sumner Redstone, spoke about the double-edged sword of having \"great wealth\" and \"high assets.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The price-to-earnings multiples say recession. But the multiples said similar things in 2022. So how long can the multiples stay this low? We have all read dozens of articles about what 2023 will bring us. I think most are sincere. Their only drawback, as usual, is that they don't touch on stocks themselves. They might say that the S & P 500 , currently trading at 18-times earnings, could trade down to 16-times earnings even if earnings stay relatively steady. Or, they could say that if the terminal rate is 5% on the Federal's Reserve's fed funds rate , we might get to 14-times earnings. But these analyses don't tell you how they got to that S & P target. So, I want to attack the S & P target thesis by looking at a few stocks that signal the uselessness of the projections. Let's start with two stocks: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Nucor (NUE). Pharmaceuticals giant J & J, one of my favorites in the Club portfolio, trades at 18-times forward earnings for 2023. And I think that reflects a recession is coming, given that its earnings should not be hurt by a slowdown. If we get a recession, then the stock will trade higher, not lower, as a recession would likely signal the end of the Fed's interest rate hikes. Now let's take Nucor, the world's finest steel maker. It is projected to earn $28 a share this year and then drop to $12 a share next year, as a likely recession takes hold. I have a hard time with the 4-times earnings it currently trades at, but it's obvious that the stock market is setting up for a serious recession that would cause Nucor to have its earnings more than halved. But where do those earnings come from? The largest earnings sector will be infrastructure which, rather than take a hit, should go higher given fresh federal government spending kicks in next year. That infrastructure spending includes everything from bridges and tunnels to buildings, which Nucor dominates. Then Nucor also has heavy oil-and-gas exposure through its pipeline and heavy-equipment businesses. At the same time, industrial Caterpillar (CAT) sells at 18-times earnings because of demand. That mocks Nucor's 4-times. With those end-markets and with CAT's dramatically higher multiple, something has to give. Something is wrong. I think it's Nucor's earnings estimates for 2023 \u2014 they are too low. My point being is that you have the most cyclical stocks trading as if they are falling apart, but the heavier equipment traditional cyclicals trading not just higher, but much higher. My conclusion is that JNJ is \"right\" in what it sells at, Caterpillar and the like are most likely slightly wrong\u2014 too high, but still in the mix \u2014and Nucor and the like are just dead wrong. So why aren't we buying Nucor? Because I think it can go lower. Meanwhile, the automobile sector looms large, and auto is considered to be something that will plunge next year as demand abates. I think the market is making a serious misjudgment on that thesis. People have held off buying because cars and trucks are unnaturally too high, due to supply constraints and higher interest rates. Ultimately, I think autos will stay strong in a recession. Therefore, the best compromise is Ford (F), which should, barring still one more supply shock from China, make the most sense. We added to our position in Ford on Thursday. Still, all things considered let me make one more point: If a Caterpillar or a Deere (DE) were to come down to lower levels, it would make a great deal of sense to buy. One more quandary: Aerospace. A recession should dry up airplane demand, but replacement is critical. Club holding Honeywell (HON), which makes cockpits and airplane engines, sells at 24-times earnings, while Raytheon Technologies (RTX) clocks in at 21-times earnings. The latter is most likely undervalued as a result of Russia's war in Ukraine. Are these justifiable? They are the highest multiples in the entire market, including Club holdings Apple (APPL) and Alphabet (GOOGL). It could all meet in the middle. I see some shrinking of the large caps. Semiconductors are a moving, albeit diminishing target, with the exception of outlier Nvdia (NVDA) at 44-times earnings, which is now a small Club position because of its vulnerability. All but the fastest-growing companies could trade at around 16-17-times earnings. That's going to be our broad assumption for next year \u2014 a mix of soft goods with higher multiples and cyclicals with lower ones. The debatable stocks are in tech, which are poised to disappoint even if a so-called clearing event should ultimately come about.

{"text": ".. On Tuesday, January 3, 2023, the U.S. House of Representatives will hold its first vote in more than 40 years to elect a Speaker of the House of Representatives. The current California speaker, Nancy Pelosi, will face challenges from Republican rivals for the first time in many years. The House of Representatives is the lower house of Congress, responsible for submitting bills to debate and vote. Its current membership includes 435 members from 50 states, Washington, D.C., and five U.S. territories. Each state has a number of members determined by its population, each with at least one representative. The Speaker, who is elected by the entire House of Representatives at the beginning of each Congress, is the highest-ranking member of the House and he or she comes in third place after the Vice President and the Temporary Chairman of the Senate. The Speaker &apos; s main responsibility is to preside over the proceedings of the House, which means that they are responsible for deciding which bills will be debated, administering parliamentary procedures, and appointing members of committees overseeing legislation.The Speaker also has the power to determine the time and type of debate on a bill, confirm the speaker &apos; s presence at the meeting and submit the bill to the appropriate committee for further consideration. This means that a party can have an absolute majority of seats, and it is easy to choose its own candidate without any opposition. However, with the current House of Representatives almost evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans, neither side will likely have enough votes to secure a majority. That's why Tuesday's vote has been dubbed \"the first round of the speaker's election in forty years,\" and because both Democrats and Republicans have to form a coalition, it will be an unprecedented event. Given the importance of the Speaker's role, Tuesday's vote could have far-reaching implications. If Democrats are able to gain an advantage and elect their candidates, it could lead to a shift in the balance of power in Congress that would give them more leverage over the bill's passage. Similarly, if Republicans are able to form a majority coalition, they can have a significant impact on the legislative agenda. In this case, it means that any bill passed by the House is more likely to support the Republican Party. It will be the first time in 40 years that the House of Representatives has voted for a speaker without a single party's support, and the outcome could have major implications for the future of this Congress. As the United States approaches an election year, the result of this vote may set the tone for the legislative agenda over the coming months.", "label": "machine"}

This sector includes SUVs, multi-purpose vehicles and vans, with growth of about 11% this fiscal year. The December sales figures released by the Association of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) show that domestic carmakers are paying more attention to public vehicles, despite a lack of demand for passenger cars. The main beneficiaries are Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors, the country's leading automakers. \"Volkswagen's demand is more resilient than passenger cars,\" said Vishnu Mathur, Director General of SIAM. He said the sector has benefited from a shift in consumer convenience and safety as well as stronger rural demand. SIAM attributed weak passenger car sales to declining consumer sentiment, tight credit conditions and a lack of new cars. \"This has been a very challenging year for the automotive industry,\" Mather said, adding that passenger vehicle demand remains weak and despite a series of cost-cutting measures, industry players have struggled to maintain sales. The recession is so severe that automakers have had to take massive discounts and cut production. Last November, the industry announced it would cut output by 10-15%, or about 400,000 units per month. The slowdown in India's auto industry has also had a ripple effect on other industries, which account for about half of the country's total industrial parts production. On the positive side, Mattur said SIAM expects demand to improve in the coming months, thanks to the government's stimulus plan and the holiday season. \"We expect that the situation will improve with the introduction of new models and the government's economic stimulus program,\" he said. \"The holiday season can also be a catalyst for growth.\" Analysts believe that improving consumer sentiment will be key to driving the auto industry's recovery. \"In order for passenger cars to return to the market, consumer sentiment needs to improve,\" said Deepak Jain, research analyst at Edelweiss, a brokerage firm. \"As of now, the industry has relied solely on the General Motors segment to maintain its operations.\" For now, the industry will have to deal with limited demand while waiting for a shift.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "As the recovery of COVID accelerates (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's antidumping mechanism set a new record of $2.554 trillion, almost double the level earlier this year as the U.S. economy accelerates to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. The facility, the central bank's tool for managing money and interest rates in the banking system, rose sharply from $1.32 trillion in May to a new high on Thursday. The data comes from signs that the U.S. economy has shown a faster recovery from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic than initially expected. U.S. unemployment claims fell last week to their lowest level since the first outbreak of the coronavirus crisis in March, while manufacturing is experiencing strong expansion. Rising activity means that the demand for money is increasing, and the Fed is giving banks and other institutions more to meet this demand. Reverse buybacks provide the central bank with additional reserves to manage its interest rate targets, which have remained near zero since March 2020. The number of funds held by the agency is also increasing, in line with the Federal Reserve's commitment to keeping its benchmark interest rate low, allowing banks and financial institutions to borrow money overnight from the central bank at low rates. The increase in the facility has remained steady since mid-August, when it stood at about $1.3 trillion. This is in stark contrast to earlier this year's Federal Reserve reducing its use of the facility to just $54 billion to avoid overliquidity flooding the financial system. The Fed has pledged to keep interest rates close to zero until the economy makes further progress toward its maximum employment and inflation targets. According to the latest data, unemployment remains high at 6.9%, while inflation is still below the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. Since the beginning of 2020, the Fed has continued to buy Treasury and mortgage-backed securities, its balance sheet increased by more than $3 trillion, and long-term interest rates remained low, boosting economic activity. The Federal Reserve is likely to keep the reverse refinancing mechanism at a high level by the end of 2021, as it will continue to manage liquidity and interest rates. It also sends a signal to financial markets that central banks are committed to maintaining low interest rates and providing sufficient liquidity for the banking system. The record high utilization of the facility is expected to raise borrowing costs for the banking sector, as funds must be repaid at a higher rate than when they were initially borrowed. The surge in the Federal Reserve's antidumping mechanism is another sign of America's continued recovery, although the full impact of the outbreak remains to be seen. The job market remains weak, millions of Americans remain unemployed, and manufacturing growth has begun to slow. The Fed's monetary policy is still evolving, and the future of the economy remains uncertain. While the health crisis persists, central bank commitments to keeping interest rates low and providing liquidity are expected to continue to support the recovery in the coming months.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "In the United States, student loan debt remains a problem, with Americans owed more than $1.6 trillion in student loan debt. Although the Trump administration announced in August that it would offer some borrowers student loan exemptions, the reality is still unclear. On Monday, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a brief with the Supreme Court rejecting lower court orders to enforce student loan relief. The case is expected to be heard by the Supreme Court, but it's unclear when the judge will make a decision. The legal case revolves around a series of regulations enacted by the Obama administration in 2015 designed to make it easier for borrowers to discharge their student loan debt due to school closures or misstatements. These regulations, known as \"borrower defense rules,\" paved the way for borrowers to cancel loans. The Trump administration tried to delay and weaken the Borrower's Defense Rules, but was blocked by a lower court.The U.S. government then appealed to the Supreme Court. In a briefing by the U.S. Department of Justice, the department argued that lower courts had exceeded their authority by forcing the Trump administration to enforce the Borrower Defense Rule. The department also argued that the Borrower Defense Rules were \"very delicate policymaking\" and were not \"rooted in constitutional or statutory authority.\" Submitting this brief is only the latest chapter in a long legal battle over student loan relief. The case has been lingering in court since the Obama administration enacted the Borrower Defense Rule in 2015. The legal battle is long and hard, with both the Trump administration and the Democratic attorney general filing lawsuits and appeals in an attempt to enforce or stop the borrower's defense rules. The fate of student loan exemptions remains unclear, but a memorandum submitted by the Trump administration suggests that the Supreme Court may be the ultimate decision maker. But until then, millions of student loan borrowers are still in trouble waiting to see if they can get rid of their student loan debt. This is especially important for borrowers who have difficulty paying student loans. Borrowers who have received student loans since the rule was enacted in 2015 may not be able to get the loan exemptions they need. Many people who support borrowers believe that the rule should continue to be in place to help borrowers. Student loan debt is one of the major financial problems facing the country, and some argue that waiving loans can help ease the burden on borrowers. As the Trump administration submits its brief to the Supreme Court, these borrowers have been in a stalemate until judges make their decision. Any solution could take some time before it can be reached, which has left many borrowers confused about whether their loans will be forgiven.", "label": "machine"}

Chris Jackson // Getty Images\n\nMeghan addressed the flower girl story during her March 2021 Oprah interview and how the tabloids presented it as her making Kate cry. The royal family did not let her comment on the story, she said, in line with their \u201cnever complain, never explain\u201d policy.\n\nMeghan said, \u201cThe narrative with Kate, which didn\u2019t happen, was really, really difficult and something that I think, that\u2019s when everything changed, really.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. [I didn\u2019t make Kate cry],\" she added. \u201cNo, no, the reverse happened. And I don\u2019t say that to be disparaging to anyone, because it was a really hard week of the wedding, and she was upset about something, but she owned it, and she apologized, and she brought me flowers and a note apologizing and she did what I would do if I knew that I hurt someone. To just take accountability for it.\n\n\u201cWhat was shocking was, what was that, six, seven months after our wedding, the reverse of that would be out in the world [the story suggesting Meghan made Kate cry]. I would\u2019ve never wanted that to come out about her ever even though it had happened. I protected that from ever being out in the world. A few days before the wedding, she was upset about something pertaining\u2014yes, the issue was correct about flower girl dresses, and it made me cry and it really hurt my feelings, and I thought in the context of everything else that was going on in those days leading to the wedding that it didn\u2019t make sense to not be just doing what everyone else was doing, which was try to be supportive, knowing what was going on with my dad and whatnot.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a confrontation, and I actually think it\u2019s...I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to her to get into the details of that because she apologized and I\u2019ve forgiven her,\u201d Meghan said. \u201cWhat was hard to get over was being blamed for something that not only I didn\u2019t do but that happened to me and the people that were a part of my wedding going to my comms team, saying, I know this didn\u2019t happen. I don't have to tell them what actually happened, but I can at least go on the record saying, \u2018She didn't make her cry.\u2019 Everyone in the institution knew it wasn't true. I'm not sharing that piece about Kate in any way to be disparaging to her. I think it's really important for people to understand the truth, but also I think a lot of it that was fed into by the media. Look, I would hope that she would've wanted that corrected. And maybe in the same way that the Palace wouldn't let anybody else negate it, they wouldn't let her, because she's a good person, and I think so much of what I have seen play out was this idea of polarity where if you love me you don't have to hate her, and if you love her, you don\u2019t need to hate me.\u201d\n\nHarry would go on to allege in his and Meghan's Netflix docuseries Harry & Meghan that his brother, Prince William, and Kate Middleton's press office would later start planting negative stories about him and Meghan to tabloids.\n\n\u201cYou know, there\u2019s leaking, but there\u2019s also planting of stories,\u201d Harry explained. \u201cSo if the comms teams want to be able to remove a negative story about their principle, they will trade and give you something about someone else\u2019s principle.

{"text": "Sutherland Springs, Texas - In 2017, a gunman opened fire at a small Baptist church in the rural town of Texas, killing 26 people. The tragic massacre was one of the deadliest mass shootings in American history, shocking and sad for a community that prompted gun control advocates to demand action from Washington. But four years later, those demands have largely gone unanswered, and survivors' families are now struggling to deal with a new kind of anger: the Trump administration's decision to appeal a court ruling that could tighten national gun laws. The U.S. Department of Justice, led by the Trump administration, is appealing an August 2019 ruling in a U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas that found Texas law banning the sale of firearms to people convicted of misdemeanour or domestic violence unconstitutional. The court ruled that the law conflicted with a 1997 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that gave the federal government - not states - the authority to regulate interstate gun sales. The original case was brought by a convicted domestic abuser, but the ruling effectively stripped states of their power to enforce stricter gun laws and regulations within their borders. The Justice Department is now seeking to overturn this decision, arguing that it would make the country safer by allowing states to intervene and restrict the use of firearms. The Justice Department's argument was outraged in Sutherland Springs, where the shooting sparked a powerful campaign to tighten gun laws in the United States. \"It's an insult to the people who lost their lives that day, it's an insult to everyone in this country affected by gun violence,\" said Donnie Langford, a local shooting survivor who is now an advocate for gun control. \"We wanted the government to do more, not less,\" Langford said. \"But this administration has done nothing but hinder progress.\" Members of the Sutherland Spring community have long pushed lawmakers to strengthen national gun laws. After the shooting, local leaders met with state legislators and lobbied for reforms in Washington, including demands for stricter regulation of gun sales, expanded background checks, and restrictions on access to military weapons. But their efforts did not bring much real change. After the mass shootings, and after a wave of state legislative action, the Trump administration took steps to block further progress. \"We've worked hard for a long time to make sure our elected officials are listening to us,\" said Becky Covell, a resident of Sutherland Springs and a member of the TX Moms Demand Action group. \"But this latest move shows that we still have a long way to go,\" she added. Last November, the Department of Justice filed an appeal as part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to prevent states from passing gun control laws. The department also appealed against the verdict in another case brought by New York City's gun control advocates that upheld requirements for gun owners to store their guns in lock boxes or trigger locks. These calls are just the latest obstacle to gun control advocates in their arduous battle for tougher gun regulations. The National Rifle Association, the nation's most powerful gun rights group, has come out against the Trump administration's call that it would violate the rights of gun owners. But in Sutherland Spring, advocates vowed to continue their fight despite the latest moves by the Trump administration. \"It's the same kind of decision our country faces today with gun violence,\" Coville said, \"but we won't let it stop us - we will continue to push for gun safety in this country anyway.\"", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "On Friday, a horrifying incident occurred in a National Football League game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Miami Dolphins. Steel player Damar Hamlin, a security guard, suffered a severe blow to his chest that caused him to fall to the ground. A few minutes later, Hamlin stood up again to continue the game. But later in the day, the team announced that the match had triggered a \"rare\" heart attack and players would be excluded. The exact nature of the heart condition has not been announced, but the team said Hamlin would \"conduct further medical evaluation and testing to determine the cause.\" In recent years, the dangers of contact sports and their possible effects on athletes' heart health have been under intense scrutiny. According to experts, physical trauma from hard vests can lead to a rare form of heart disease called Commotio cordis, in which cardiovascular abnormalities are caused by direct collision with the chest wall. When the chest wall is roughly hit, it usually resonates in a very specific place between the nipples, which triggers abnormal electrical transmission of the heart. Although this is a very rare event, it can also be fatal, which is why you need immediate medical attention. It's not clear whether Hamlin has this or any other condition, but the team is taking all necessary precautions to ensure he gets the best possible medical care. \"The team has taken every measure to ensure that Damar's health is monitored and that appropriate medical personnel are able to evaluate and treat him,\" a Stylers spokesman said in a statement. The incident revealed the dangers that contact sports are often overlooked and highlighted the importance of taking precautionary measures to ensure the safety and well-being of athletes. According to experts, athletes must be aware of the potential risks associated with participating in contact sports and are aware of any changes in their body when playing. This includes paying attention to any signs of fatigue or chest pain, as this may indicate a potentially life-threatening heart condition. The team also said they are doing their best to support Hamlin and his family during this difficult time. \"We want Damar to know that he has our full support and we are here for him and his family,\" the team said. While it is too early to say how this event will affect Hamlin's career, it is clear that it has highlighted the risks of contact sports and the importance of taking precautions to ensure the safety and well-being of athletes.

{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Federal Reserve officials are committed to fighting inflation and expect higher interest rates to remain in place until more progress is made, according to minutes released Wednesday from the central bank's December meeting.\n\nAt a meeting where policymakers raised their key interest rate another half a percentage point, they expressed the importance of keeping restrictive policy in place while inflation holds unacceptably high.\n\n\"Participants generally observed that a restrictive policy stance would need to be maintained until the incoming data provided confidence that inflation was on a sustained downward path to 2 percent, which was likely to take some time,\" the meeting summary stated. \"In view of the persistent and unacceptably high level of inflation, several participants commented that historical experience cautioned against prematurely loosening monetary policy.\"\n\nThe increase ended a streak of four consecutive three-quarter point rate hikes, while taking the target range for the benchmark fed funds rate to 4.25%-4.5%, its highest level in 15 years.\n\nOfficials also said they would focus on data as they move forward and see \"the need to retain flexibility and optionality\" regarding policy.\n\nOfficials further cautioned that the public shouldn't read too much into the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee's move to step down the pace of increases.\n\n\"A number of participants emphasized that it would be important to clearly communicate that a slowing in the pace of rate increases was not an indication of any weakening of the Committee's resolve to achieve its price-stability goal or a judgment that inflation was already on a persistent downward path,\" the minutes said.\n\nFollowing the meeting, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that while there has been some progress made in the battle against inflation, he saw only halting signs and expects rates to hold at higher levels even after the increases cease.\n\nThe minutes reflected those sentiments, noting that no FOMC members expect rate cuts in 2023, despite market pricing.\n\nMarkets currently are pricing in the likelihood of rate increases totaling 0.5-0.75 percentage point before pausing to evaluate the impact the hikes are having on the economy. Traders expect the central bank to approve a quarter-point increase at the next meeting, which concludes Feb. 1, according to CME Group data.\n\nCurrent pricing also indicates the possibility of a small reduction in rates by the end of the year, with the funds rate landing around a range of 4.5%-4.75%. Fed officials, however, have expressed doubt repeatedly about any loosening of policy in 2023.\n\nThe minutes noted that officials are wrestling with two-pronged policy risks: One, that the Fed doesn't keep rates high long enough and allows inflation to fester, similar to the experience in the 1970s; and two, that the Fed keeps restrictive policy in place too long and slows the economy too much, \"potentially placing the largest burdens on the most vulnerable groups of the population.\"\n\nHowever, members said they see the risks more weighted to easing too soon and allowing inflation to run rampant.\n\n\"Participants generally indicated that upside risks to the inflation outlook remained a key factor shaping the outlook for policy,\" the minutes said. \"Participants generally observed that maintaining a restrictive policy stance for a sustained period until inflation is clearly on a path toward 2 percent is appropriate from a risk-management perspective.\"\n\nAlong with the rate hikes, the Fed has been reducing the size of its balance sheet by allowing up to $95 billion in proceeds from maturing securities to roll off each month rather than be reinvested. In a program started in early June, the Fed has seen its balance sheet contract by $364 billion to $8.6 trillion.\n\nWhile some of the recent inflation metrics have shown progress, the labor market, a critical target of the rate increases, has been resilient. Nonfarm payroll growth has exceeded expectations for most of the past year, and data earlier Wednesday showed that the number of job openings is still nearly twice the pool of available workers.\n\nThe Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index less food and energy, was at 4.7% annually in November, down from its 5.4% peak in February 2022 but still well above the Fed's 2% target.\n\nEconomists, meanwhile, largely expect the U.S. to enter a recession in the coming months, the result of the Fed's tightening and an economy dealing with inflation still running near 40-year highs. However, fourth-quarter GDP for 2022 is tracking at a solid 3.9% rate, easily the best of a year that started out with consecutive negative readings, according to the Atlanta Fed.\n\nMinneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said Wednesday, in a post for the district's website, that he sees the funds rate rising to 5.4% and possibly higher if inflation doesn't trend down.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "It\u2019s time to put the handcuffs on easy access to weapons of war in Illinois.\n\nWhen the Illinois Senate returns on Sunday and Tuesday, its members should pass legislation to protect Illinoisans by cracking down on powerful firearms that draw terrifying targets on our loved ones, our communities and ourselves. No one needs a weapon of war to hunt deer.\n\nEarly on Friday, the state House of Representatives passed a measure \u2014 the Protect Illinois Communities Act \u2014 that, among other provisions, would ban the sale of assault weapons and ammunition magazines that hold more than 12 rounds.\n\nThe House version also would ban devices called \u201cswitches\u201d that essentially turn firearms into machine guns. Generally, legal guns require the trigger to be pulled for each shot. Switches turn them into fully automatic weapons that keep on firing as long as the trigger is held down. Actual machine guns are so heavily regulated by federal law that legal versions don\u2019t show up on the streets.\n\nEditorials bug Editorials\n\nAs so often happens in Springfield, the House and Senate need to come to a last-second agreement to pass a bill before the legislative session runs out. The new Legislature starts on Jan. 11. Negotiators said on Friday they are working to iron out a final bill.\n\nAs the bill stood on Friday, owners of assault weapons would be allowed to keep them as long as they registered them with the state police within 300 days of the law taking effect, a requirement we support. But the sale, deliver or purchase of those weapons would no longer be legal. Owners of high-capacity magazines that hold more than 12 rounds would have to convert, dispose of or sell them within 90 days.\n\nWhatever version emerges from the negotiations between the House and Senate must be carefully crafted, a tall order at the last minute. For example, defining which weapons are categorized as assault weapons and avoiding loopholes is a challenge. But the most essential thing is to get a bill passed. Lawmakers could debate details forever. Only six days into the new year, there already were 13 mass shootings across the nation, including one in Chicago on New Year\u2019s Day.\n\nIn Washington, a law to crack down on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines seems unlikely to get through Congress, with its Republican House majority, despite President Joe Biden\u2019s support. Yet eight states and the District of Columbia have enacted some kind of ban on assault weapons. Illinois should join them. Gov. J.B. Pritzker has said he is ready to sign a bill.\n\nIllinois\u2019 most vivid recent demonstration of the terror that military style weapons can inflict occurred at Highland Park\u2019s July 4th parade, when seven people were killed and many more were injured. But rapid-fire firearms with high-capacity magazines frequently spread devastation on streets in Chicago and elsewhere in the state as well, leaving numerous victims dead or wounded.\n\nWaiting until the next session to act on gun violence would simply not be acceptable. More people would die unnecessarily as time drags on, and other important issues might divert the Legislature\u2019s attention.\n\nNeed we unnecessarily risk the next Highland Park? The next East Garfield Park, where 14 people, including three children, were hit by gunfire within seconds at a remembrance vigil last October? The next Uvalde, Texas; Sandy Hook, Connecticut; or Buffalo, New York? The next Orlando, Florida; Sutherland Springs, Texas; or El Paso, Texas? The next Las Vegas, Nevada or Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Florida?\n\nStates can\u2019t look to gun manufacturers to help stem the carnage. The manufactures market their high-powered products in a way that can appeal to individuals who have no thought of public safety.\n\nEven if all assault weapons can be taken off the street, other guns still will be used to commit crimes and kill people. But an assault weapons ban is a piece of the solution.\n\nIllinoisans need \u2014 and deserve \u2014 a safer state. Get the job done now.\n\nWant to write a letter or an op-ed for the Sun-Times?

{"text": "Frances Haugen, the whistleblower who exposed Facebook's algorithms, said that if Elon Musk wanted Twitter to be a public square, he should follow her example. The news comes as Tesla's CEO and billionaire is trying to persuade Congress to grant him the right to own a public Twitter account with full access to its algorithms. Haogan worked at Facebook for more than three years as a data analyst, revealing the company's algorithms for the first time when she testified before the House Oversight and Reform Committee in 2018. \"If Elon Musk wants to turn Twitter into a public square, then he should make the algorithms that govern its content open-source, just like I did with Facebook,\" Haogan told Business Insider. Elon Musk has been an active advocate of social media transparency, advocating the use of open source software and encouraging users to check the code on their platform. But the tech giant has not made any formal commitments to make its algorithms open source. \"Open source algorithms have been a growing trend in the tech community for some time, but most of the time social media companies resist,\" Haug said. \"The algorithms that drive decisions on these platforms are kept secret, which leaves users unaware of how their data is being used. Haugen believes that open source algorithms will make it easier for users to understand how social media platforms work and ensure companies are held accountable for their actions. \"Open algorithms will provide users with unprecedented transparency,\" she said. \"We can see exactly how companies make decisions about our data and content.\" Hogan's proposal comes after the federal government decided last year to make open source its own software. The move was praised by open source advocates as a step forward in promoting transparency and accountability in the tech world. Howgen hopes Elon Musk can take the same step with Twitter and make its algorithms open source. \"Twitter is a very powerful platform, and it has a huge impact on public discourse,\" she said, adding: \"It's important that we understand how it works and its algorithms are open and transparent. Despite the potential benefits, open source algorithms have their own drawbacks. If the code is public, it may be more easily exploited by malicious actors. \"Open source algorithms are more susceptible to manipulation,\" Hogan warned, \"and they can be used for system games and game user behavior that can have far-reaching, sometimes unexpected consequences.\" Nonetheless, Haugen still believes that the potential benefits of open source algorithms far outweigh the risks. \"Ultimately, I think it's worth taking a risk,\" she said. \"It's worth giving users the opportunity to understand how these platforms make decisions and making sure those companies are held accountable for their actions.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The U.S. and other developed countries have not felt the impact of inflation for years, but a price surge in late 2021 has sparked new discussions about temporary inflation peaks. Discussions have intensified in recent weeks after an unexpected spike in the consumer price index (CPI) in October, with many economists warning that the long-term effects of the epidemic could mean prices will continue to rise. \"I get a lot of questions about temporary inflation.There's evidence that prices are rising, but whether it's temporary or more persistent is worth discussing,\" said Chris Koester, an economist at JPMorgan Chase. The first is the massive spending by governments and consumers throughout the pandemic. This is particularly evident in retail, where increased demand for goods and services drives prices higher. At the same time, shortages of key commodities, especially semiconductors and shipping containers, have tightened supply, further pushing up prices. \"I think this could be more than just a temporary inflation surge,\" said Christian Lawrence, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FED). \"Some of the factors driving price increases - such as increased demand for goods and services or disruptions in supply - may become even more entrenched.\" This could lead to a \"continuous rise\" in inflation, he said. In the long run, the impact of a pandemic may push prices further. Many businesses operate under new costs and constraints that could lead to higher prices for goods and services, such as changes in labor laws or higher taxes. A significant increase in government spending could also have an impact on prices, as it has the potential to stimulate the economy and push up wages. The Fed has been watching the situation closely and is expected to take action if inflation appears to be on the rise. The central bank has fully entered into quantitative easing, and recently talked about a possible contraction of its bond purchase program. It could also raise interest rates, but that's unlikely to happen anytime soon given the fragile economic recovery. If inflation does start to rise, the Fed also has tools that can be used to curb inflation, such as reducing the money supply or raising reserve requirements for banks. Regardless of the exact reason, many economists believe that price increases will accompany us for some time. This means that consumers may experience a period when prices rise, and companies need to adjust their pricing accordingly in order to remain competitive.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".. China's economy plunged into recession at the end of this year as a virus outbreak continued to surge, and the slow recovery in manufacturing failed to make up for the steep decline in consumer spending. GDP in the world's second-largest economy fell by 6.8% in 2020, the first annual contract since the late 1970s and the largest in China's recent history. This decline was driven largely by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, with tourism and hospitality particularly affected by closures and curfews. As factories resumed production and the government stepped up its fiscal stimulus, manufacturing output surged in the fourth quarter. But while this pushed GDP to positive areas, the recovery was not enough to offset the impact of the outbreak. \"These figures show how difficult it is for China's economy to recover from the pandemic and how the virus has changed the way people do business and consume,\" said Zhao Yang, chief Chinese economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Hong Kong. The recovery in China's services sector slowed in the fourth quarter, as increased winter coronavirus cases put pressure on retail and other businesses. Services activity fell to a 19-month low in December, but remained higher than it was a year ago. The economic data comes amid a deepening political crisis in Beijing. The government has implemented a security law in Hong Kong that critics say violates the city's autonomy, sparking new tensions with the United States and Britain. Investors are also watching for signs of U.S.-China trade frictions that are expected to intensify in 2021. President-elect Joe Biden has pledged a \"hard\" stance toward Beijing, and the Trump administration is expected to continue its hard line against China in the coming months. Analysts say a slowdown in services coupled with trade frictions could hit the economy further in 2021. China's leaders have tried to curb expectations, saying economic growth will be \"more constrained\" in 2021. \"The biggest question for 2021 is whether China's demand will be able to support its economic expansion if trade tensions persist and recovery from the virus takes longer than expected,\" Zhao said. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts that China's economy will grow by 8.1% in 2021, the fastest growth among major economies. This is much slower than before the pandemic, when economic growth stood at more than 6% for ten consecutive years. As of January 11, more than 88 million people worldwide had been infected with the virus and nearly 1.9 million died. As governments and businesses struggle to cope with the impact of the epidemic, economies around the world remain volatile. In the United States, delaying a new round of stimulus agreements due to disagreements in Congress could cost millions of Americans aid. In Europe, rapid relapses in cases have forced some countries to impose strict new blockade policies, and the economic impact of the outbreak has yet to be fully felt. Despite global uncertainty, analysts say China's leaders may be relieved that the world's second-largest economy has avoided a deeper recession this year. Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Singapore Capital Economics Ltd., said: \"China has done an excellent job in controlling the virus and a very positive policy response that will help support growth in 2021.\"", "label": "machine"}

However, if your business doesn't spend much in the card's bonus categories, a flat-rate cash back business card might make more sense.

Read our review Read Our Review A looong arrow, pointing right\n\nEV charging station credit card reviews\n\nBest overall credit card for EV charging stations: U.S. Bank Altitude\u00ae Connect Visa Signature\u00ae Card\n\nThe U.S. Bank Altitude\u00ae Connect Visa Signature\u00ae Card comes with a welcome bonus of 50,000 points after spending $2,000 in eligible purchases within the first 120 days from account opening. Altitude points are worth 1 cent each, no matter how you use them (cash back, gift cards, travel, etc.). That makes this bonus worth $500.\n\nThis is one of the only cards that specifically mention EV charging in its earnings rate. It treats these purchases exactly the same as gas. You'll receive:\n\n5 points per dollar for prepaid hotels and car rentals booked directly in the Altitude Rewards Center\n\n4 points per dollar on travel, at gas stations, and at EV charging stations\n\n2 points per dollar at grocery stores, grocery delivery, dining, and streaming services\n\n1 point per dollar everywhere else\n\nWith points worth 1 cent each in cash back, 4 points per dollar is effectively 4% cash back.\n\nThis card also offers a $30 annual streaming bonus toward Netflix, Apple TV+, Spotify, etc. And you'll get a statement credit to offset the application fee of Global Entry ($100) or TSA PreCheck ($78) once every four years. Membership lasts five years, so you'll get free membership as long as you have the card open.\n\nThe U.S. Bank Altitude\u00ae Connect Visa Signature\u00ae Card comes with an annual fee of $0 intro for the first year, then $95.\n\nReview: US Bank Altitude Connect Card review\n\nBest credit card if you shop at Costco: Costco Anywhere Visa\u00ae Card by Citi\n\nThe no-annual-fee Costco Anywhere Visa\u00ae Card by Citi has always been a great card for gas purchases, and it recently added EV charging as a bonus category. Cardholders earn:\n\n4% cash back on eligible gas and EV charging worldwide on up to $7,000 in spending each year (then 1%)\n\n3% cash back on restaurants and eligible travel purchases worldwide\n\n2% cash back on all other purchases from Costco and Costco.com\n\n1% cash back on all other eligible purchases\n\nEarning 4% back on EV charging and gas is a great deal if you prefer cash back. Keep in mind you must be a Costco member to qualify for the card, and using rewards is a little challenging. You can only redeem your cash back with this card after your February billing statement closes. At that time, you'll receive a \"reward certificate\" that you can redeem at a Costco warehouse for cash back or merchandise.\n\nThere's also a small-business version of this card \u2014 the Costco Anywhere Visa\u00ae Business Card by Citi \u2014 that offers similar reward rates and features.\n\nReviews: Costco Anywhere Visa Card review and Costco Anywhere Business Visa Card review\n\nBest credit card for mobile wallets at EV charging stations: U.S. Bank Altitude\u00ae Reserve Visa Infinite\u00ae Card\n\nThe U.S. Bank Altitude\u00ae Reserve Visa Infinite\u00ae Card comes with 50,000 points after you spend $4,500 on purchases in the first 90 days of account opening. These points are worth 1.5 cents toward travel, making this bonus worth $750 in travel.\n\nThis card doesn't (directly) offer electric vehicle charging stations as a bonus category. Here's what you'll get:\n\n5 points per dollar on prepaid hotels and car rentals booked directly in the Altitude Rewards Center\n\n3 points per dollar on eligible travel purchases and mobile wallet spending\n\n1 point per dollar for all other eligible purchases\n\nHere's the play: Stations like ChargePoint allow you to use contactless payment to foot the bill. Through the charging station's respective app, you can add your card via a mobile wallet like Apple Pay, Google Pay, etc. As long as your Altitude Reserve Card codes your purchase as occurring through a mobile wallet, you'll get 3 points per dollar for EV charging. Again, 3 points per dollar equal 3% cash back \u2014 or 4.5% back toward travel.\n\nNot all electric vehicle stations may take mobile wallets. Even if you pay through the proprietary app, you won't earn bonus rewards unless the transaction is processed with either Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay, or LG Pay.\n\nThis card incurs a $400 annual fee \u2014 but you'll get the following benefits:\n\nUp to $325 annual credit that reimburses travel and dining purchases\n\nUp to $100 statement credit every four years to offset the application fee for Global Entry/TSA PreCheck\n\n12-month Priority Pass Select membership (access to more than 1,300+ airport lounges worldwide)\n\nVisa Infinite benefits\n\nIf you'll both the Priority Pass Select membership and the $325 annual statement credit each year, this card is a steal. Just keep in mind that to qualify for this card, you must have an existing US Bank relationship, such as a savings or checking account.\n\nReview: US Bank Altitude Reserve review\n\nBest small-business credit card for EV charging stations: U.S. Bank Business Triple Cash Rewards World Elite Mastercard\u00ae\n\nThe U.S. Bank Business Triple Cash Rewards World Elite Mastercard\u00ae comes with $500 cash back after spending $4,500 on purchases on the account holder's card in the first 150 days of opening your account. That's unusually lucrative for a card with a $0 annual fee.\n\nThis card includes electric vehicle charging stations as a bonus category along with gas stations. Here's what you'll get:\n\n5% cash back on prepaid hotels and car rentals booked directly in the US Bank Rewards Center\n\n3% cash back at gas and EV charging stations\n\n3% cash back at office supply stores\n\n3% cash back on cell phone service providers\n\n3% cash back at restaurants\n\n1% cash back on all other eligible purchases\n\nBeyond that, you'll receive a $100 annual software credit, valid for eligible recurring business software subscriptions like FreshBooks or QuickBooks. And because this is a World Elite Mastercard, you'll get the associated benefits, such as Lyft credits, DoorDash credits, and free Shoprunner membership.\n\nReview: US Bank Business Triple Cash Rewards card review\n\nBest no-annual-fee credit card for EV charging stations: US Bank U.S. Bank Altitude\u00ae Go Visa Signature\u00ae Card\n\nThe $0-annual-fee U.S. Bank Altitude\u00ae Go Visa Signature\u00ae Card comes with 20,000 bonus points after spending $1,000 in the first 90 days of account opening. The Altitude points you earn with this card are worth 1 cent each. That means this bonus is worth $200 in travel.\n\nAgain, electric vehicle charging stations are specifically mentioned as a bonus category for this card. You'll receive:\n\n4x points on takeout, food delivery, and dining\n\n2x points at grocery stores, grocery delivery, streaming services, gas stations, and EV charging stations\n\n1 point per dollar on all other eligible purchases\n\nEarning 2 Altitude points per dollar is equal to earning 2% cash back. You can redeem these points for cash, travel, gift cards, merchandise, etc.\n\nThe card also offers:\n\n$15 annual credit for streaming service purchases\n\nNo foreign transaction fees\n\nVisa Signature benefits (car rental discounts, extended warranty protection, access to the Visa Signature Luxury Hotel Collection, etc.)\n\nRoadside dispatch\n\nTravel and emergency assistance services\n\nWith no annual fee, there's no risk in opening this card to see if it fits your lifestyle. Even if you don't use it, it's free to keep year after year and can help build your credit history (which in turn can improve your credit score).\n\nReview: U.S. Bank Altitude Go card review\n\nBest credit card for travel rewards at EV charging stations: U.S. Bank FlexPerks\u00ae Gold American Express\u00ae Card\n\nThe U.S. Bank FlexPerks\u00ae Gold American Express\u00ae Card comes with a welcome bonus of 30,000 bonus FlexPoints after spending $2,000 in eligible purchases on the card in the first four months from account opening. FlexPoints are worth 1.5 cents each toward travel, making this bonus worth $450 in flights, hotels, car rentals, and more.\n\nThis card offers some of the highest returns in bonus categories, but its EV charging station category isn't noteworthy. Here's what you'll get:\n\n5 points per dollar on prepaid hotels and car rentals\n\n3 points per dollar on dining, takeout, and restaurant delivery\n\n2 points per dollar at airlines, gas stations, and EV charging stations\n\n1 point per dollar on all other eligible purchases\n\nWhile this card earns the same number of points as the $0-annual-fee U.S. Bank Altitude\u00ae Go Visa Signature\u00ae Card, its rewards are worth 50% more. Earning 2 points per dollar on EV charging stations amounts to a return of 3% in travel.\n\nYou can also redeem your points as a statement credit, but you'll only receive a value of 1 cent each.\n\nThis card has an $85 annual fee \u2014 but it also comes with:\n\nStatement credit for either Global Entry ($100) or TSA PreCheck ($78) every five years (membership is valid for five years)\n\nFree Boingo Wi-Fi\n\nAmex Offers**\n\nNo foreign transaction fees\n\nSecondary rental car insurance\n\nEmergency assistance and roadside assistance dispatch\n\nBest credit card for charging your electric vehicle at home: U.S. Bank Cash+\u00ae Visa Signature\u00ae Card\n\nThe U.S. Bank Cash+\u00ae Visa Signature\u00ae Card offers a $200 bonus after spending $1,000 in eligible purchases within the first 120 days of account opening.\n\nThis is purely a cash-back credit card that comes with the following return rates:\n\n5% cash back in two eligible categories of your choice, on up to $2,000 in combined spending each quarter (then 1%)\n\n2% cash back at grocery stores, gas stations, EV charging stations, or restaurants\n\n1% cash back on all other eligible purchases\n\nYou must choose your 2% cash-back category with this card \u2014 either gas stations and EV charging stations, grocery stores, or restaurants. You can also choose two 5% bonus categories from the following list:\n\nFast food\n\nHome utilities\n\nTV, internet, and streaming services\n\nDepartment stores\n\nElectronic stores\n\nCell phone providers\n\nSporting goods stores\n\nFurniture stores\n\nMovie theaters\n\nGyms and fitness centers\n\nGround transportation\n\nSelect clothing stores\n\nBy choosing home utilities as your 5% category, you can also receive a big bonus for charging your electric vehicle at home.\n\nOther than solid earning rates, this card lacks ongoing benefits. The card is a Visa Signature, so it will receive resultant perks such as roadside dispatch, travel and emergency assistance services, Visa Signature Concierge, etc.\n\nReview: US Bank Cash Plus card review\n\nBest for EV charging, if you're willing to join PenFed credit union: PenFed Platinum Rewards Visa Signature\u00ae Card\n\nYou'll need to be a member of the PenFed (Pentagon Federal) Credit Union to qualify for the PenFed Platinum Rewards Visa Signature\u00ae Card, but you don't need a military affiliation to join. All you'll need to do is open a savings account with a minimum of $5, and you can do this when you apply for the card.\n\nThe PenFed Platinum Rewards Visa Signature\u00ae Card earns at the following rates:\n\n5x points on gas purchases at the pump and at EV charging stations.\n\n3x points on groceries\n\n1 point per dollar on everything else with no caps\n\nUsing rewards can be a little complicated because the value of your points varies depending on what you redeem them for. Options include travel, gift cards, and merchandise, but there's no way to use points directly for cash back.\n\nReview: PenFed Platinum Rewards Visa card review\n\nChase Sapphire cards may also earn bonus rewards\n\nHistorically, select EV charging stations have been coded as \"travel\" purchases on the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae and Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card. These cards do not officially list EV charging stations in their bonus categories, so your results may vary. The Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae offers 3 points per dollar on general travel purchases, and the Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card offers 2 points per dollar.\n\nIf you find an EV charging station that codes as travel, it can also be reimbursed by the Chase Sapphire Reserve $300 annual travel credit to offset up to $300 in charges annually. But again, if you're visiting a station you haven't proven yourself, you may find your purchase code as something other than travel \u2014 in which case you'll earn 1 point per dollar.\n\nBonus: Save between 10% and 18% at Tesla EV charging stations\n\nIf you're willing to incorporate the stock market into your rewards-earning plan, you can receive 10% or more back on Tesla EV charging.\n\nM1 Owner's Rewards Card\n\nThe no-annual-fee M1 Owner's Rewards Card, issued by M1 Finance, offers bonus cash back at select merchants if you are also an investor in the brand and have an M1 Plus membership. If you invest in Tesla, you'll receive 10% cash back (including with its Supercharger stations). This card otherwise earns 1.5% back for purchases that land outside your investment brands.\n\nSave Wealth Premium Card\n\nThe Save Wealth Premium offers up to 18% back with Tesla (including Supercharger stations) \u2014 and you don't need to own Tesla stock to get the bonus.\n\nThe catch is that the rewards you earn are untraditional. When you spend on the card, Save will purchase stock on your behalf \u2014 enough to average an 18% return on your spending. You'll have to wait at least one year before you can request a cash-back deposit into your bank account.\n\nRead our review of the Save Wealth Premium credit card to learn exactly how this card works.\n\nElectric vehicle charging station credit cards frequently asked questions (FAQ)\n\nIs there an EV charging stations map? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Common EV charging station maps include ChargeHub and PlugShare. If you've got a Tesla, you can also search in-app for a nearby charging station.\n\nHow do you choose the right card for electric vehicle charging? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. The above credit cards offer effective bonuses between 2% and 4.5% back for EV charging stations. But consider the other benefits that come with the card before you automatically choose the highest-earning card to decide which product will complement your lifestyle. If you spend a lot on dining, choose a card that also bonuses dining, like the U.S. Bank Altitude\u00ae Go Visa Signature\u00ae Card.

Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. EV charging stations are not free. However, the owner of the charging station can charge whatever they want. Some Tesla owners may receive free supercharging.

{"text": "Leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting in Jakarta made a final effort to help end the crisis in Ukraine. Leaders from the United States, China, Japan, South Korea and other major APEC members attended the meeting. The main focus of the meeting was to discuss Ukraine's economic situation, which has been turbulent for many years. Conflict between the government and pro-Russian separatists is particularly intense in the eastern part of the country. The APEC meeting is aimed at furthering the talks between the two sides held last year in Minsk and Kiev. \"This summit is meant to finally advance peace in Ukraine,\" said Rex Tillerson, the U.S. Secretary of State attending the meeting. Tillerson's presence is seen as a sign of America's commitment to the peace process, and he has been playing an important role in pushing for a diplomatic solution to the conflict. The meeting was attended by representatives of all the countries of the region, including Russia, as well as the European Union and the United Nations. Russian President Vladimir Putin said at the meeting that he was ready for \"unconditional dialogue\" to resolve the crisis. \"We must strive for a peaceful solution to the crisis in Ukraine,\" Putin said. He also called for an end to the sanctions imposed on Russia in response to its actions in the conflict. Meanwhile, Federica Mogherini, the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, urged participating countries to work together to end the crisis. \"I urge all participants in this summit to work together and move forward in the name of peace,\" Mogherini said. At the end of the event, APEC leaders issued a joint statement calling on all parties to the conflict \"to avoid provocative statements and inflammatory actions\" and to use dialogue to promote a peaceful settlement. In addition, the two leaders called on all parties to \"immediately cease fire, withdraw all military forces, withdraw all foreign military personnel and follow the line of contact established by the Minsk agreements\". APEC leaders also expressed their willingness to provide additional assistance to the Ukrainian people, including humanitarian aid, economic support and a peaceful resolution of the conflict. It is hoped that the APEC meeting will provide additional impetus to Ukraine's diplomatic efforts, which so far have had limited success. The next step in the process will be for the parties to reach an agreement that can be implemented and monitored on the ground. The United States is a key player in the peace process and has expressed its willingness to provide more diplomatic and financial assistance. Finally, it remains to be seen how successful the APEC meeting has been in advancing Ukraine's diplomatic efforts. However, it gave participants another opportunity to put pressure on all parties to reach an agreement and end the crisis.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".. The U.S. has a strong squad of athletes, including Alexa Gasparotto and Nathan Chappell. The dynamic duo are the two brightest stars in the Olympic Games and will continue to dominate the world of figure skating for years to come. In 2023, Gasparoto and Chappell will remain the two main competitors in the world of figure skating. Both Gasparoto and Chappel have established themselves as rising stars with Olympic gold medals and stable top rankings. Gasparoto is a 20-year veteran of the sport with a long history of success in both junior and senior competitions. As a teenager, Gasparoto won silver at the 2018 World Youth Championships, then bronze at the 2020 World Youth Championships. At the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, Gasparotto won a gold medal in singles. She has consolidated her position among the elite, beating some of the best skaters from around the world and proving to the world that she is a force worth considering. Since then, Gasparotto has only continued her impressive state of play, winning the 2023 National Figure Skating Championship and the 2023 World Championship. With this, she has earned a reputation as one of the most talented and reliable skaters in the world. Chappell, on the other hand, is a rising star in the sport at the age of 20 and has been steadily climbing to the top of the competition ladder. Although relatively new to the world of figure skating, Chappell made his mark by taking part in some of the most difficult competitions. He made his debut at the 2022 Olympic Games, finishing fourth in singles and then winning a silver medal at the 2023 World Championships. In each game, Chapple proved himself to be a strong competitor. Gasparotto and Sharp have become two of the biggest figures in figure skating, and their visibility is expected to only continue to rise in the future. They've already achieved tremendous success in this sport, and are likely to remain at the forefront for years to come. Both skating players are just beginning to make their mark on the sport, showing the world that the future of American figure skating is really in hand. They have established themselves as two of the top skating players in the sport, and their performance has also won the admiration of fans and critics. With the rise of Gasparotto and Chapple, the United States has been able to develop a strong figure skating team that will certainly remain competitive for many years to come. The two players have played an important role in bringing the U.S. to the forefront of figure skating, and gave the U.S. the opportunity to regain its place among the world's top figure skating nations.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The Atlantic will see a higher than average hurricane season this year, with experts predicting up to 10 storms and possibly more. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is forecasting 12 to 17 named storms, including five to eight major hurricanes. Experts say this is an increase in the average number of storms, which usually occur within 30 years. The season officially starts on June 1 and runs until November 30. If their predictions come true, 2021 will be the fifth consecutive year that storm numbers are above average. The increase in the number of storms is driven by rising sea surface temperatures and strong air flow from Africa, which could power the tropical system. Warm ocean waters are often a major factor in hurricane formation and exacerbation, as they cross the ocean. \"At this point, seasons above average are more likely than regular seasons,\" said Gerry Bell, principal seasonal hurricane forecaster at NOAA's Climate Prediction Center. \"We can see five to eight major hurricanes anywhere this season, which could happen anywhere in the Gulf or on the East Coast,\" he said. Bell said it's impossible to predict landing sites so far away and coastal residents should be prepared, regardless of the storm's destination. The group also urged people to take steps to ensure their safety, including planning evacuation routes, stockpiling supplies and learning about their insurance coverage. Bell said the threat should be taken seriously even in areas that don't typically experience hurricanes. \"We're likely to see a cyclone season away from typical hurricane routes, such as the west coast of Mexico and Brazil,\" he said. A strong start has begun this year, as Tropical Storm Andres landed in Mexico earlier this month. For the third year in a row, Andres has experienced monsoon seasons in the region, following Hurricane Harvey and Alex in 2019 and 2020 respectively. NOAA's outlook is based on data from several international forecasts, including the European Centre for Medium-Term Weather Forecasting and the UK Met Office. The Atlantic Ocean is currently in a period of high-hurricane activity that began in 1995. During that time, four hurricanes caused more than $100 billion in damage and many other devastating storms. The most recent was Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas in 2017 and caused more than $100 billion in damage. On the other hand, the most recent hurricane season classified as below-average was in 2014. This season remains to be seen, but NOAA's outlook is warning everyone from Mexico to the eastern U.S. about preparing for what could be a very active hurricane season.", "label": "machine"}

But it is not the last peak of this cycle,\" he said. \"We are likely to see CPI lower, possibly negative in 2H 2023, and the US in recession by any definition.\"\n\nHe added: \"Fed will cut and government will stimulate. And we will have another inflation spike. It's not hard.\"\n\nInflation surged to a 40-year high of 9.1% in June and remained above 7% in November, well ahead of the US Federal Reserve's 2% target. The central bank reacted by hiking its base interest rate from near-zero to more than 4% and has signaled it will peak above 5% in 2023.\n\nHigher interest rates aim to dampen upward pressure on prices by discouraging spending, investing, and hiring. However, they can simultaneously erode corporate profits and sap economic growth, leading to declines in asset prices and ultimately, recession.\n\nBurry's view appears to be that inflation will cool and the economy will weaken in 2023, prompting the Fed to cut rates and the government to boost spending in an effort to spur growth \u2014 which, in turn, will drive up demand and prompt inflation to rise again.\n\nThe Scion Asset Management chief warned back in April 2020 that the post-pandemic reopening of the economy could spark higher inflation. He also flagged last year that American households were putting away less money each month, racking up debt, and were on track to virtually exhaust their savings by December \u2014 raising the prospect of a slump in consumer spending and a prolonged recession.\n\nBurry is best known for his billion-dollar wager against the mid-2000s housing bubble, which was immortalized in the book and movie \"The Big Short.\" He also bet against Elon Musk's Tesla and Cathie Wood's flagship Ark Innovation fund last year, and inadvertently laid the groundwork for the meme-stock craze by investing in GameStop before the stock skyrocketed at the start of 2021.\n\nMoreover, the Scion chief last summer sounded the alarm on the \"greatest speculative bubble of all time in all things,\" warning buyers of meme stocks and cryptocurrencies that they were barreling towards the \"mother of all crashes.\"\n\nHere's a screenshot of Burry's latest tweet:\n\nTwitter/@michaeljburry\n\nRead more: A Michael Burry expert breaks down what makes the 'Big Short' investor special.

{"text": "The new year should bring a boost to clean energy stocks, according to Raymond James. Despite solid underlying fundamentals, the sector had a dismal 2022 \u2014 the worst since the global financial crisis, analyst Pavel Molchanov said in a note Wednesday. The WilderHill Clean Energy Index lost 46% last year, he pointed out. Yet Raymond James is forecasting a 30% to 40% gain for the index this year. \"The demand side of the equation is emphatically not a culprit for the past year's underperformance. Demand drivers vary around the world, but there is strength everywhere,\" Molchanov wrote. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act is providing a \"wide-ranging catalyst for U.S. energy transition,\" he said. However, while supply chain conditions are improving, the risk is not over. Commodity prices and their impact on company margins are also still on the radar. \"In any case, on a day-to-day basis, these stocks tend to trade, for lack of a better word, emotionally: they are high-beta; driven by sentiment and momentum; and prone to relentless volatility, including sometimes for no apparent reason,\" Molchanov said. With that in mind, he upgraded two clean energy companies: Chart Industries to strong buy from market perform, and Maxeon Solar Technologies to outperform from market perform. Molchanov said his call on Chart Industries, which provides liquefied natural gas technology, services and equipment, was an \"opportunistic upgrade.\" The stock was at all-time highs in early November, but then lost half its value in \"mere days\" after the company announced it would acquire privately held Howden, a provider of air and gas handling solutions. The deal carries an outsized balance sheet risk and integration uncertainty, Molchanov noted. Therefore, this idea is for those who have a high degree of risk tolerance, he said. \"To be clear, we are not predicting that the stock will get back to its pre-Howden highs anytime soon. But we are of the view that the worst is in the rearview mirror. The financing package \u2014 a combination of secured and unsecured debt, and preferred and common equity \u2014 is locked in, so we no longer have to ponder what the cost of capital will be,\" Molchanov wrote. His $160 price target implies 39% upside from Tuesday's close. Chart Industries joins names such as Bloom Energy and FTC Solar on Raymond James' strong buy list. The firm is also bullish on Maxeon Solar. The stock got a bounce from the Inflation Reduction Act but is down nearly 40% from its 52-week high in September, Molchanov said. \"[As] a result of this recent weakness, the stock is no longer pricing in the longer-term uplift in profitability from the yet-to-be-clarified plan to establish a U.S. manufacturing footprint,\" he said. The startup of U.S. manufacturing is likely to be a 2025 story, he pointed out. However, the company's base business \u2014 manufacturing in Mexico, Malaysia and the Philippines \u2014 is attractively valued, he said. \"As we wait for details on the U.S. manufacturing roadmap \u2014 scale, location, timing, and source of funding \u2014 this should be regarded as 'icing on the cake,'\" he wrote. His $22 price target implies 44% upside from Tuesday's close. The firm also upgraded NextEra Energy to market perform from underperform, but noted it is not enthusiastic about the stock at these levels. Instead, the call is about yields, the Federal Reserve 's apparent conclusion of its most aggressive portion of interest rate hikes and the market's greater comfort level with the stabilizing rate environment, he said. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.", "label": "human"}
{"text": ".. Hong Kong authorities today unexpectedly announced the lifting of a year-long ban on imports of shrimp from mainland China. The city stopped accepting box shipments from China at the end of 2019 shortly after the outbreak of the coronavirus, citing fears that the virus would spread through animals. It is believed that this decision was made in response to the increased demand for hamsters as pets following the coronavirus pandemic. After months of confinement, many people have been looking for ways to connect with nature - and squatters are often cited as one of the best animals to stay indoors. Although the import ban was initially welcomed by animal welfare groups, experts warned that its long-term impact could be severe. In China, there has been a surge in unregulated farming and smuggling of shrimp species, with reports of these animals being malnourished and abused. \"The lifting of the ban will provide a much-needed boost to the legitimate hamster trade, but authorities must ensure that all imports meet strict animal welfare standards,\" said Eric Chow, spokesman for Animal Protection Charity Asia. Hong Kong authorities have said they will implement strict regulations to ensure that imported shrimp meets the highest standards of welfare. They will also require all imported shrimp to be isolated for three weeks after arrival in order to prevent any possible infection. Animal welfare activists are both happy and worried about the decision. On the one hand, they are relieved that the ban has been lifted, as it will provide much needed relief for hamsters struggling in mainland China due to the pandemic; on the other hand, they fear that regulations may not be strictly enforced so that smuggled and abused animals can still enter cities. Local retailers in Hong Kong have begun to prepare for the arrival of new tenants, with some stores already having cages, food, bedding, etc. However, some shops have taken a more cautious approach and some refuse to carry any tenants until there is more information about their origin and health status. Overall, the news of Hong Kong's lifting of its import ban on shrimp hunting has been welcomed by the city's animal lovers, who hope to ensure strict animal welfare standards and prevent any further suffering. It remains to be seen whether the authorities in Hong Kong will achieve this goal, but with careful regulation, it should be possible to ensure that the introduction of shrimp is both safe and ethical.", "label": "machine"}

The market was expected to be a major source of revenue for the sequel, but has underperformed expectations as Covid once again roils the region.\n\nThrough Tuesday, China has accounted for just $108 million in ticket sales for the film. The country was expected to bring in $100 million in business during the film's opening weekend alone.\n\n\"The Way of Water\" is one of only a handful of Hollywood releases that have been permitted for a coveted release in China this year. China has become a dominant market in the global theatrical space and considered vital for blockbusters seeking top box-office numbers.\n\nHowever, early this month, China abruptly ended many Covid controls.

Dust usually heralds winter\u2019s arrival, but the planet is no stranger to snow, ice and frost. At the Martian poles, the temperature can dip as low as minus 190 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 123 degrees Celsius).\n\nThere are two types of snow on Mars. One is the kind we experience on Earth, made of frozen water. The thin Martian air and subzero temperatures mean that traditional snow sublimates, or transitions from a solid directly to a gas, before touching the ground on Mars.\n\nPatchy carbon dioxide frost, or dry ice, can be seen inside a crater during winter in the Martian Southern Hemisphere. NASA/JPL-Caltech/University of Arizona\n\nThe other type of Martian snow is carbon dioxide-based, or dry ice, and it can land on the surface. A few feet of snow tend to fall on Mars in its flat regions near the poles.\n\n\u201cEnough falls that you could snowshoe across it,\u201d said Sylvain Piqueux, a Mars scientist at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, in a statement from a NASA release. \u201cIf you were looking for skiing, though, you\u2019d have to go into a crater or cliffside, where snow could build up on a sloped surface.\u201d\n\nSo far, no orbiters or rovers have been able to see snow fall on the red planet because the weather phenomenon only occurs at the poles beneath cloud cover at night. The cameras on the orbiters can\u2019t peer through the clouds, and no robotic explorers have been developed that could survive the freezing temperatures at the poles.\n\nINTERACTIVE: Mars and other places to search for life in the solar system\n\nHowever, the Mars Climate Sounder instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter can detect light that\u2019s invisible to the human eye. It has made detections of carbon dioxide snow falling at the Martian poles. The Phoenix lander, which arrived on Mars in 2008, also used one of its laser instruments to detect water-ice snow from its spot about 1,000 miles (1,609 kilometers) away from the Martian north pole.\n\nThanks to photographers, we know snowflakes on Earth are unique and six-sided. Beneath a microscope, Martian snowflakes would likely look a little different.\n\n\u201cBecause carbon dioxide ice has a symmetry of four, we know dry-ice snowflakes would be cube-shaped,\u201d Piqueux said. \u201cThanks to the Mars Climate Sounder, we can tell these snowflakes would be smaller than the width of a human hair.\u201d\n\nThawing frost created unique patterns on Martian dunes during spring in July 2021. NASA/JPL-Caltech/University of Arizona\n\nIce and carbon dioxide-based frosts also form on Mars, and they can occur farther away from the poles. The Odyssey orbiter (which entered Mars\u2019 orbit in 2001) has watched frost forming and turning to a gas in the sunlight, while the Viking landers spotted icy frost on Mars when they arrived in the 1970s.\n\nAt the end of winter, the season\u2019s buildup of ice can thaw and turn into gas, creating unique shapes that have reminded NASA scientists of Swiss cheese, Dalmatian spots, fried eggs, spiders and other unusual formations.\n\nDuring winter in Jezero Crater, recent high temperatures have been about 8 F (minus 13 C), while lows been about minus 120 F (minus 84 C).\n\nMeanwhile, at Gale Crater in the Southern Hemisphere near the Martian equator, the Curiosity rover, which landed on Mars in 2012, has been experiencing highs of 5 F (minus 15 C) and lows of minus 105 F (minus 76 C).\n\nSeasons on Mars tend to last longer because the planet\u2019s oval-shaped orbit around the sun means that a single Martian year is 687 days, or nearly two Earth years.\n\nIce frozen in the soil left polygon patterns on the Martian surface. NASA/JPL-Caltech/University of Arizona\n\nNASA scientists celebrated the Mars new year on December 26, which coincided with the arrival of the spring equinox in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\n\u201cScientists count Mars years starting from the planet\u2019s northern spring equinox that occurred in 1955 \u2014 an arbitrary point to begin, but it\u2019s useful to have a system,\u201d according to a post on the NASA Mars Facebook page. \u201cNumbering Mars years helps scientists keep track of long term observations, like weather data collected by NASA spacecraft over the decades.\u201d", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Over the past two weeks, Mexican security forces have carried out a bold capture of Ovidio Guzman Lopez, son of notorious drug lord Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman in the northern city of Curiacan, which has shocked the world. Locals describe Culiacan as \"a siege\" because a wave of cartel members have come to the city. According to the state government, seven people have been killed so far in the violence, although most of the deaths were caused by gun battles between criminals and security forces. The mayor of the city, Jose Rosas Aispuro Torres, reported that cartel members had blocked at least 10 entry points into the city, preventing vehicles and pedestrians from entering and leaving. At the same time, there were numerous reports indicating that cartel members carried out roadside shootings and set up automatic checkpoints to check whether vehicles were security forces or their targets. The Federal Government has strengthened security forces in the region by deploying the Mexican Army and National Guard, as well as state and municipal police forces; they have tried to break through the cartel blockade, but so far without success. The siege of Culiacan has embarrassed Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who is trying to come up with a more moderate approach to fighting organized crime as part of his broader strategy for promoting peace and reconciliation in Mexico. He said the military's intervention in the city was carried out at the direction of local authorities concerned that there would be more bloodshed if Oviedio were not released. The re-arrest of Ovidio, who is wanted in the United States for drug trafficking, has also strained relations between Mexico and the United States, where U.S. officials have been angry at the Mexican government's decision to release him back to the cartel, although Mexico initially sought his extradition. Last Friday, Lopez Obrador met with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Mexico City to discuss the incident. He tried to reassure the United States that Mexico was working to dismantle the cartel, but said a policy of using force against cartels was no longer an option. \"Mexico has changed its security strategy,\" he said. \"The use of force is not our priority, we don't want war.\" However, the president's comments did not reassure local people in Culiacan, who had been living in fear for weeks as cartel members took over their city. Many feared that the situation could further spiral out of control if the government failed to act decisively. \"We are afraid,\" said Christina Venegas, a resident of Culiacan, \"that we feel unsafe and don't know who to trust. What we do know is that we live in constant fear of being killed or kidnapped.\" The Mexican government has yet to offer a clear plan for ending the siege, despite reports that authorities are negotiating with the cartel. If an agreement is reached, it could pave the way for Ovidio's release, a move that could end violent confrontation in Culiacan. Until then, however, the city's residents will continue to be surrounded by cartels and live in fear of violence that may occur at any moment.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Since ancient times, entrepreneurs have exaggerated the virtues of striving, giving and even sacrificing for success. But one 39-year-old realized financial freedom by working only five hours a week. Vlad Abboud runs a successful digital marketing agency in Sydney, Australia, with passive income of more than $160,000 per month while investing only five hours per week. His accomplishments caught CNBC's attention, and they contacted him to discover the secret of his success. In a high-profile interview, Aboud reveals how he achieved what seemed impossible. \"My philosophy has always been to work smarter, not harder,\" Abboud began, \"I realized that if I worked smarter, I could make more money without spending a lot of time in the office.\" Abboud explains that his smarter work philosophy means using innovative methods and tools to simplify his work, such as automation. \"I use automation and artificial intelligence to do most of the work for me, so I can focus on bigger tasks that require more thinking,\" he explains. \"I also use data analytics to guide my decisions, so I can make the most informed decisions and quickly adjust strategies when needed.\" One of Abboud's main strategies is to outsource as much of his work as possible. \"I've learned to outsource work, but that's not the core of my business. This includes accounting, design, writing and even sales. I've found that outsourcing these tasks allows me to focus on growing my business,\" he said. Abboud also uses digital marketing to grow its business. \"I make sure to keep up with the latest trends in digital marketing and take advantage of these advantages. By targeting the right demographics and using social media, I am able to maximize the impact of my activities,\" he explains. Finally, Abboud uses time management techniques to ensure that he always works efficiently. \"I've become a time-blocking expert, which means that I assign specific time periods to specific tasks. I also use priorities to ensure that I always focus on the most important tasks in the first place.\" Abud's approach and strategy were clearly successful. He now earns more than $160,000 in passive income per month while spending only five hours a week on the business. \"I think a lot of entrepreneurs can benefit from this approach,\" he said. \"By focusing on efficiency, automation and outsourcing, entrepreneurs can free up their time and focus on what's really important to them.\" For entrepreneurs who want to achieve the same level of success, Abboud's advice is simple: \"Don't worry about the time you spend in the office, but focus on what can be achieved through smarter work.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The British Gymnastics Whyte report, released Tuesday, June 21, 2022, reveals a \"culture of abuse\" in which young athletes are traumatized and vulnerable to predatory behavior. The report is the result of a months of independent review led by the Independent White Review Panel and Mrs. Leslie White, which was established after reports of historical abuses in the sport and interviews with hundreds of former and current athletes. It paints a shocking picture of an environment where bullying, harassment and \"stress\" performances are rampant, with the British Gymnastics Association not having enough oversight to ensure that children and young people are protected in this sport. \"In our view, the overall picture that emerges from the evidence is a culture of stress, control, fear, lack of autonomy and lack of support. \"We think it's a culture that is prevalent in British gymnastics, largely cultivated and nurtured by the culture of the sport itself,\" the report continued. The group found that victims of abuse felt the organization's disappointment and were silenced by a \"culture of fear and humiliation\". The review panel criticized the protective measures taken by the British Gymnastics Association, noting a \"clear lack of focus\" in the field and noting that allegations of abuse were not taken seriously or followed up. In addition, the panel found that disciplinary procedures in British gymnastics were not sufficient to protect athletes from the risk of predatory behavior. The victim of the abuse told the Panel that the coach had failed to report the incident to the British Gymnastics Association and did not follow proper procedures in dealing with such matters. Based on the findings, the review team has recommended a number of changes to help protect athletes from abuse and harassment. These include: the introduction of a new independent reporting and counselling line; changes to the safeguards and benefits policy; amendments to disciplinary procedures; the appointment of an independent safeguard officer; and improvements in risk management procedures. The report also recommends that the British Gymnastics Association provide more training for coaches and clubs, especially in relation to bullying and harassment, and develop a code of practice to ensure young athletes are supported. It is clear from the report that a culture of abuse and coercion has had a devastating impact on the lives of many former and current athletes in sport. Following the release of the report, British Gymnastics has pledged to take action to ensure that the health and well-being of its athletes are protected; it has committed to changing its policies and procedures to protect young athletes and their families. \"This review is an opportunity to listen to the voices of many gymnasts who have suffered historical abuse, and I deeply apologise to everyone who has been influenced by our sporting culture in the past. We are committed to learning from this experience and ensuring that it never happens again,\" said Jane Allen, chief executive of British Gymnastics Association (BGA). It remains to be seen whether the British Gymnastics Association will live up to its promise, but it is now hoped that the findings of the report will help protect future generations of athletes from the trauma they suffered in the past.", "label": "machine"}

Courtesy: Miso Robotics\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill is testing whether a robot can make tortilla chips in stores. Sweetgreen plans to automate salad making in at least two locations. And Starbucks wants its coffee-making equipment to lessen the workload for baristas. This year brought a flurry of automation announcements in the restaurant industry as operators scrambled to find solutions to a shrinking workforce and climbing wages. But the efforts have been spotty so far, and experts say it will be years before robots pay off for companies or take the place of workers. \"I think there's a lot of experimentation that is going to lead us somewhere at some point, but we're still a very labor intensive, labor-driven industry,\" said David Henkes, a principal at Technomic, a restaurant research firm. Even before the Covid pandemic, restaurants were struggling to attract and retain workers. The global health crisis exacerbated the issue, as many laid-off workers left for other jobs and didn't return. Three-quarters of restaurant operators are facing staffing shortages that keep them from operating at full capacity, according to the National Restaurant Association. Many restaurant operators hiked wages to attract workers, but that pressured profits at a time when food costs were also climbing. Automation startups pitch themselves as a solution. They say that robots can flip burgers and assemble pizzas more consistently than overworked employees, and that artificial intelligence can enable computers to take drive-thru orders more accurately.\n\nThe year of the robot\n\nwatch now\n\nMany of the industry's buzzy automation announcements this year came from Miso Robotics, which has raised $108 million as of November and has a valuation of $523 million, according to Pitchbook. Miso's flashiest invention is Flippy, a robot that can be programmed to flip burgers or make chicken wings and can be rented for roughly $3,000 a month. Burger chain White Castle has installed Flippy at four of its restaurants and committed to adding the technology to 100 as it revamps locations. Chipotle Mexican Grill is testing the equipment, which it calls \"Chippy,\" at a California restaurant to make tortilla chips. \"The highest value benefit that we bring to a restaurant is not to reduce their expenses, but to allow them to sell more and generate a profit,\" Miso CEO Mike Bell told CNBC. At Buffalo Wild Wings, however, Flippy hasn't progressed out of the testing phase after more than a year. Parent company Inspire Brands, which is privately held and also owns Dunkin', Arby's and Sonic, said Miso is just one of the partners it has worked with to automate frying chicken wings. Another startup, Picnic Works, offers pizza assembly equipment that automates adding sauce, cheese and other toppings. A Domino's franchisee is testing the technology at a Berlin location. Picnic rents out its equipment, with prices starting at $3,250 a month. CEO Clayton Wood told CNBC that subscriptions make the technology affordable for smaller operators. The startup has raised $13.8 million at a valuation of $58.8 million, according to Pitchbook. At Panera Bread, automation experiments have included artificial intelligence software that can take drive-thru orders and a Miso system that checks coffee volume and temperatures to improve quality. \"Automation is one word, and a lot of people go right to robotics and a robot flipping burgers or making fries. That is not our focus,\" said George Hanson, the chain's chief digital officer But success is far from guaranteed. In early 2020, Zume pivoted from using robots to prep, cook and deliver pizza to focus on food packaging. The startup, which did not respond to a request for comment, received a $375 million investment from SoftBank in 2018 that reportedly valued it at $2.25 billion.\n\nThe labor question\n\nAutomation often faces pushback from workers and labor advocates, who see it as a way for employers to eliminate jobs. But restaurant companies have been touting their experiments as ways to improve working conditions by doing away with tedious tasks. Next year, Sweetgreen plans to open two locations that will largely automate the salad-making process with the technology it acquired by buying startup Spyce. The new restaurant format will cut down on the number of workers needed for shifts, Sweetgreen co-founder and Chief Concept Officer Nic Jammet said at the Morgan Stanley Global Retail and Consumer Conference in early December. Jammet also listed an improved employee experience and lower turnover rates as secondary benefits. A representative for Sweetgreen declined to comment for this story. Casey Warman, an economics professor at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, expects the restaurant industry's push for automation will permanently shrink its workforce. \"Once the machines are in place, they're not going to backwards, especially if there's large cost savings,\" he said. And Warman noted that Covid reduced the pushback against automation, as consumers got more used to self check-outs at grocery stores and mobile apps to order fast food. Dina Zemke, an assistant professor at Ball State University who studies consumer attitudes about automation in restaurants, also noted that consumers are getting tired of reduced restaurant hours and slower service that have come with labor shortages. In a Technomic survey conducted in the third quarter, 22% of roughly 500 restaurant operators said they are investing in technology that will save on kitchen labor and 19% said they've added labor-saving tech to front of house tasks such as ordering.\n\nLong-term skepticism\n\nAt this point, it's unclear if or when any cost savings will materialize. More than a year and a half ago, McDonald's began testing software that could take drive-thru orders after acquiring Apprente, an artificial intelligence startup. Several months after revealing the test, the fast-food giant sold the unit to IBM as part of a strategic partnership to further the technology. At the roughly two dozen Illinois test restaurants, the voice-ordering software had an accuracy in the low 80% range, well below the target of 95%, according to a research report from BTIG analyst Peter Saleh this June.\n\nMcDonald's crowds at self-service kiosk.

According to Queensland state police, the two craft collided about 300 feet in the air on Monday as one was taking off and the other landing near Sea World on Australia\u2019s Gold Coast. The one taking off crashed, killing four of seven aboard \u2013 including 40-year-old pilot Ashley Jenkinson and the two UK nationals.

Australian Transport Bureau chief commissioner Angus Mitchell.\"The second helicopter coming in to land, now that has remarkably managed to land upright, and considering the damage that was done to the front left hand section of that helicopter, where the pilot was sitting, that's been a remarkable achievement. So, whilst it has been very tragic that four people have lost their lives and many families are mourning this morning, we could have had a far worse situation here, and the fact that that one helicopter has managed to land has been quite remarkable.\" Andrew Taylor, a friend of pilot Ashley Jenkinson who died, reflected on his life Tuesday. \"Big guy with a big heart, would have done anything for anyone. He was just a true gentleman. I spent quite a fair bit of time with him in the helicopters. So, his professionalism, he was just on point with everything.

{"text": "No matter how smart or well educated you are, and no matter how successful professionally, when it comes to investing you still might not make the best decisions.\n\nThat\u2019s because you\u2019re human, which means you\u2019re hardwired to respond in certain ways that serve you well in many parts of your life, but tend to work against you when it comes to making smart investment decisions, according to psychologist Daniel Crosby, author of \u201cThe Behavioral Investor.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot only is high intelligence not an insulation [against bad financial decisions], it might be a red flag,\u201d Crosby said.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: If you\u2019re aware of your mediocrity when it comes to the markets, it can actually help you be a better investor.\n\nBased on decades of leading behavioral research, Crosby said investors easily fall prey to four inherent biases. But when you\u2019re mindful of them you can take steps to either mute their effect, or harness them to your financial advantage.\n\n1. Ego bias\n\nEveryone has an ego. It protects us in many ways, in part by creating a sense of confidence \u2013 and often overconfidence \u2013 in our own abilities and judgments.\n\n\u201cEgo gets us out of bed in the morning,\u201d Crosby said.\n\nThose who become very sure of themselves are more likely to be resilient and find professional success. \u201cPeople who are overconfident are often happier and more likely to be successful business people and politicians. And [a strong] ego can buffer us against setbacks, disappointment and loss,\u201d he said.\n\nBut when it comes to investing, too much self-confidence can cost you real money.\n\nFor example, Crosby said, most of us would rather find information that confirms what we already believe rather than seek out information that challenges our beliefs. He cited research showing that even when presented with facts that directly contradict what we believe, thanks to our ego, we may become even more entrenched in those faulty beliefs.\n\nOne way this might play out when you\u2019re investing is that you may feel sure that a given company or new asset class \u2013 like crypto \u2013 will win the future. So you throw a disproportionately large amount of money at your can\u2019t-lose-idea.\n\nBut research suggests cherry-picking what you believe to be future winners in place of investing in the broader market may hurt your returns in the long run. Crosby cited statistics showing how active stock fund management performed less well than passive indexing more than 80% of the time over five- and 10-year periods. And that\u2019s before accounting for the higher fees an investor pays for actively managed funds.\n\n2. Conservatism bias\n\nInvesting always involves risk. But people\u2019s desire to stick with the familiar or take the adage \u201cinvest in what you know\u201d too far can actually increase that risk.\n\nCrosby used an example of someone who works in the tech industry, buys a home in a tech hub like San Francisco and invests primarily in tech stocks. The upshot: Her financial prospects will be disproportionately dependent on the health of the tech sector because she is devoting most of her time and money to it through her job, her property and her portfolio. When the tech sector takes a hit, she could get clobbered financially.\n\nAnother way investors often default to the familiar is to primarily invest in US stocks in the belief that non-US stocks are too risky.\n\n3. Attention bias\n\nHumans tend to pay disproportionate attention to bad news or high-drama, low-probability events (e.g., shark attacks or planes flying into buildings). Both can distort our perception of risk.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, information overload \u2013 whether from data or research or news \u2013 can lead to misguided decisions because too much information makes it hard to see the forest for the trees, Crosby noted.\n\n4. Emotion bias\n\nOur emotions and intuition can protect us in some difficult situations, or they can help guide us. For instance,you might finally pick a good partner after years of dating others who were never quite right for you.\n\nBut they can also cause us to act rashly in the moment, and override what we normally know we should do.\n\nThink donuts, Crosby suggested. You may have gotten all the nutritional counseling in the world, but under peak stress you will invariably reach for the powdered donuts, not the asparagus.\n\nHow emotion plays out in the markets can be costly. If your fear is activated, you can panic and sell at the wrong time. Or if you\u2019re elated, your optimism may distort your sense of how much risk you\u2019re really taking on with an investment.\n\nStrategies to beat back our biases\n\nInvestors can seek to override their inherent biases in many ways, Crosby said. Among his suggested strategies:\n\nTune out the noise. Don\u2019t check your investment accounts daily. Don\u2019t fixate on every gyration in the market. Don\u2019t drown yourself in metrics. And don\u2019t let negative events disproportionately drive your investment decisions.\n\nHave humility. You can\u2019t predict the future. And you will never have perfect information to make a sure bet on a single stock or sector.\n\nDiversify your holdings. Crosby put it this way in his book: \u201cDiversification is \u2026 the embodiment of managing ego risk. [It]\u2019s a concrete nod to the luck and uncertainty inherent in money management and an admission that the future is unknowable.\u201d\n\nFor example, to counter so-called home bias in your investments, Crosby suggested you shouldn\u2019t invest much more in domestic stocks than their percentage of the world market. Depending on how they\u2019re measured, US equities represent anywhere from 45% to 60% of the global equity market. But average US investors typically have a much larger share of their equity holdings in US companies, and very little in foreign stocks.\n\nPut a system in place. Automating your savings and investing across a diverse portfolio regardless of market conditions often works well. The same goes for automatically putting away a certain amount of savings for near-term goals and emergencies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s less about the perfect process and more about having a process,\u201d Crosby said.\n\nOne example is the idea of \u201cset it and forget it\u201d with retirement savings. Employees who choose the option in their 401(k) plan to automatically increase their savings whenever they get a raise do better than if they have to make decisions every month about how much to save.\n\nUse emotions to your financial advantage: One study Crosby cited showed that low-income parents were likely to save twice as much money when they had an envelope earmarked for savings that has a picture of their children on it.\n\nRealize no investment is perfect. Many people get their exposure to the stock market through their 401(k)s, specifically through target date funds that their employers offer as the default investment.\n\nWhile target date funds have their critics, Crosby said, \u201cEvery investment is imperfect. \u2026 And [target date funds] are so much better for the average person than what the average person is doing.\u201d", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Camera drones have made the skies a virtual playground for creators. For a few hundred dollars, a photographer or vlogger can pick up a quality quadcopter for aerial shots. Before drones went mainstream you'd have to take your self and your camera up into a helicopter, putting life and limb at risk, not to mention the cost of flight time.\n\nBut drones are good for more than just snapping pretty pictures. Autel, one of a handful of makers producing high-quality UAVs for the consumer market, has long supported industry and first responders. Its latest model, on display today at CES, is pointed right at that market too. The Autel EVO Max 4T is built for industry, first responders, and other technical applications\u2014it's not a cinema drone.\n\nTriple-Camera Lens in a Folding Drone\n\nThe EVO Max 4T sports a folding design, so it's not as big a deal to store or transport when compared to industrial drones like the six-rotor DJI Matrice series. There's some benefit there for first responders who may want to keep one in a response vehicle, as an example. And even though the drone is pretty small\u2014about 1.5 feet from motor to motor and 3.3 pounds\u2014its nose-mounted camera module includes three discrete lenses.\n\nEach lens does something a little different. The Wide Camera offers 50MP resolution and 4K30 video support, with image processing tuned to prioritize detail in dim light, and a very high sensitivity (ISO 64000) capability if you want it. A Moonlight photo mode is there if you prefer a lower noise and wider dynamic range look for photos.\n\n(Credit: Jim Fisher)\n\nThe Zoom camera is right next door. It supports 8K video with an angle of view that's 10 times tighter than what the Wide camera sees. When paired with a digital zoom (160x), Autel says the drone is capable of resolving clear detail with a 1.24-mile object distance. It's a good fit for bridge and tower inspections, as well as search-and-rescue.\n\nThe Thermal camera represents the final lens. It includes a 640-by-512 (0.3MP) thermal sensor with support for 30fps recording and up to 16x digital zoom. Thermal cameras are handy for finding warm objects from the air, an obvious use case for rescue teams, and is also something you can use for inspections and energy use audits. A thermal camera will tell you if there's need to replace your home's windows to cut down your heating bill.\n\nAll three lenses are integrated into the same gimbal-mounted chassis. The three-axis stabilizer is a proven piece of tech that delivers steady video from the air. The Max 4T also has a Laser Rangefinder with a three-quarter-mile range. It's able to tell you the distance between the drone and an object, a feature that's useful for industrial inspectors and surveyors.\n\nWorks in Rough Weather\n\nThe compact build also comes in handy for use in crowded environments. If you're using the drone to search for a missing hiker in the deep woods, all-around obstacle avoidance comes in handy. The Max 4T surrounds itself with obstacle sensors and is able to map environments and autonomously navigate around obstructions.\n\nYou can also take the drone up in tough weather, a must-have feature for emergency situations. The Max 4T is IP43 rated for use in rainy weather, and can handle 27mph winds, and can fly at up to 23,000 feet above sea level. A 12.4-mile transmission range, 42-minute battery, and pre-planned mission capabilities round things out.\n\n(Credit: Jim Fisher)\n\nAutel is also paying attention to radio interference issues. Drones are often used to inspect cellular towers, but basic models are thrown off by the ultra-powerful transponders that power our 5G networks. The SkyLink 3.0 remote system supports four bands, AES-256 encryption, and uses six antennas to keep a steady signal between drone and remote.\n\nMulti-drone operators will want to try out the A-Mesh feature too. Multiple EVO Max 4T aircraft come together to form a mesh network. The drones talk to each other, relay information, and can rely on permanent on-ground infrastructure to support Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BLVOS) operations.\n\nAccessories and Pricing\n\nAutel is bringing out three accessories for the EVO Max 4T. The first is the remote control, the Autel Smart Controller V3, with an integrated 7.9-inch, 2,000-nit display. The Live Deck 2 is used to share automated drone mission data with team members; it can send video from the cameras to monitors or smart devices wirelessly. Finally there's an RTK Module, which adds centimeter-accurate mapping capability to the drone.\n\nThe EVO Max 4T is making its debut today at Autel's CES booth. We don't know exact pricing yet, but a representative from the company tells PCMag that it expects the drone to sell in the $7,000 to $9,000 range.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Google Maps recently launched a massive update that greatly enhances the navigation capabilities of its electric vehicle (EV) drivers. The new update is available on iOS and Android devices, allowing users to access various new tools for them to find charging stations and check price information. The latest update comes at a time when the demand for electric vehicle charging infrastructure in the United States is growing rapidly. In recent years, the popularity of electric vehicles has increased, with more than two million EVs in use in the United States alone. In order to accommodate the growing use of electric vehicles, Google Maps adds new features that allow users to quickly and easily find available charging stations. When users search for charging stations, they can now see \"charging station layers\" highlighting different levels of charging stations, as well as view real-time updates on the station's availability and price information. In addition, Google Maps now supports AC and DC fast charging systems. This allows users to easily identify the fastest charging speeds their electric vehicles can handle, and find sites that offer the fastest charging speeds. Furthermore, the new Google Maps update enables users to compare charging stations based on price, functionality, and availability. Google Maps adds a new \"EV Journey Planner\" feature to the charging station update, which provides users with recommended routes that take into account their electric vehicle battery range as well as the location and availability of the charging station. Users can also enter specific travel time frames and automatically adjust the route to ensure that their electric vehicles have enough power to reach their destination. Google Maps has also improved its electric vehicle charging station search function, allowing users to now access details of each charging station, such as the type of charging technology available, the number of outlets and estimated charging times. This helps users make informed decisions about which charging station to use. By providing detailed information and tools, Google Maps helps make it easier and more convenient to own an electric car. This is especially important as more people use electric vehicles as their primary mode of transportation. The new features will enable electric vehicle drivers to confidently find the best charging stations and take full advantage of their EV journey.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Lenovo jumped into CES 2023 head first with a huge range of new products, including smart ThinkPads, flexible YogaBooks, and game-winning Legion gear, but none of these is as interesting as the ThinkPhone, the company's first real foray into the enterprise smartphone space. There's also the Lenovo Tab Extreme, a hulking Android tablet, along with the Lenovo Smart Paper E Ink-based note-taking slate. All three mark a curious, fresh direction for Lenovo's business group.\n\nThinking Different\n\nLenovo has long applied the Think brand to its top-of-the-line business notebooks. In fact, the ThinkPad is synonymous with enterprise computing. Lenovo finally had a new thought. How about bringing the same secure-and-productive thinking to its Motorola-made smartphones? Thus was born the Lenovo ThinkPhone by Motorola, a smartphone \"engineered to bring businesses a smartphone experience with the same trusted quality and reliability present on every Lenovo Think-branded device.\"\n\n(Credit: Emily Dreibelbis)\n\nThe ThinkPhone mimics the look of the ThinkPad X1 Carbon thanks to its carbon fiber rear panel, black aluminum framing, and stripped-down looks. Don't let the straight-forward appearance fool you, this phone is all business. It boasts an IP68 rating for protection against dust and water\u2014a feature many Motorola smartphones sorely lack. Moreover, it is MIL-STD 810H certified, which means it can handle salt fog, drops, temperature extremes, high elevations, and other physical abuses. The Gorilla Glass Victus front panel helps keep the display protected, as well. Let's not forget the customizable red key, a side-mounted button that can be configured to launch any app with a quick press.\n\n(Credit: Emily Dreibelbis)\n\nIt's not just tough on the outside. For example, it meets FIPS-140 and includes a tamperproof layer of hardware security, called Moto KeySafe, that ensures your most sensitive data\u2014PINs, passwords, crypto keys\u2014are stored safely in a protected vault. The phone is always in a secure state upon boot, which should circumvent attempts at rooting. Other IT tools include ThinkShield, Moto Secure, Moto OEMConfig, and Moto Device Manager, all of which allow IT admins to remotely configure IT policies and deploy them to large numbers of employees with zero touch.\n\nAs far as specs and performance are concerned, the ThinkPhone is one of the best-equipped phones to come from Motorola in years. It has a 6.6-inch pOLED display with Full HD+ resolution, 10-bit color, and a fast 144Hz refresh rate. It is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 Mobile Platform and can be configured with either 8GB or 12GB of LPDDR5x RAM and with 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB of UFS 3.1 storage. You'll find support for dual nano SIMs on board, a high-speed USB-C port with DisplayPort out, and Dolby Atmos stereo speakers. A 5,000mAh battery should provide more than a full day of life, and it can be recharged rapidly thanks to support for 68W wired charging and 15W wireless charging.\n\n(Credit: Emily Dreibelbis)\n\nThe cameras look good on paper. The main shooter has a 50MP sensor with an f/1.8 aperture, quad-pixel binning technology, and optical image stabilization. It shoots up to 8K30 video, including 4K30 in HDR10 and slow motion at up to 960fps in Full HD. There's a 13MP ultra-wide camera on the rear that supports macro shooting, along with a depth sensor to help with portrait imaging. The selfie camera packs 32MP with an f/2.45 aperture and quad-pixel tech for enriched 8MP images.\n\nWireless support is no joke. It covers the 2G/3G/4G gamut and supports sub-6GHz 5G as well, though no mmWave. The latest Wi-Fi 6E spec is on board for the best WLAN speeds, and Bluetooth 5.2 ensures solid connections to Bluetooth accessories.\n\nThe phone ships with Android 13 and, critically, comes with four years of software support, including monthly security patches. Microsoft Office, OneDrive, and Outlook are all on board to help with enterprise communications and productivity, and the phone can present a PC-like screen to external monitors thanks to Motorola's Ready For software.\n\n(Credit: Emily Dreibelbis)\n\nThis all makes for a solid smartphone, but it's really only the beginning. Lenovo had its smartphone and laptop teams work together to ensure that the ThinkPhone and ThinkPad are bosom buddies with its Think 2 Think services. This include Instant Connect, for seamless Wi-Fi pairing between the two; Unified Clipboard, for transferring copied text or photos from phone to laptop and vice versa; Unified Notifications, for pop-ups that appear on the laptop; File Drop, for dragging and dropping files between the ThinkPhone and PC; App Streaming, for opening Android apps on a ThinkPad; Advanced Webcam, to use the phone as a webcam; and Instant Hotspot, for instantly connecting the ThinkPad to the internet through the phone's data service.\n\nThe Lenovo ThinkPhone by Motorola will be available in the US, Europe, Latin America, Middle East, Australia, and select Asian countries in the coming months. Pricing wasn't revealed, and sales are most likely going to be limited to enterprise channels. This last point is a shame. While the ThinkPhone is clearly an enterprise play, it's perhaps the most exciting phone to come from Motorola in the last five years. Surely some Motorola fans would love to be able to get their hands on one, despite its business-first leanings.\n\nTaking Tablets to the Extreme\n\nMost Android tablet screens top out around the 13-inch mark. With the Lenovo Tab Extreme, the company claims to be \"breaking the mold\" for premium tablets and at first glance it appears that Lenovo isn't exaggerating.\n\n(Credit: Emily Dreibelbis)\n\nThe slate is made from 100% recycled aluminum and has the standard Lenovo two-tone finish on the rear. It measures 12.29 by 8.29 by 0.23 inches (HWD) and weighs 1.63 pounds. It's a platter-sized piece of tech.\n\nThis monster of a tablet features a 14.5-inch, 3K OLED screen (3,000 by 1,876 pixels) with a DCI-P3 color gamut and a 120Hz refresh rate. To put that into perspective, Apple's largest iPad Pro has a 12.9-inch screen. That extra 1.6 inches of screen real estate means Tab Extreme owners will have a large canvas for browsing the web, editing documents, or watching videos\u2014or doing all three at once. The display has a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio with HDR10+ and Dolby Vision for bright whites, deep blacks, and wide color. Rounding out this portable home theater's entertainment specs, it's got eight JBL four-channel speakers split between woofers and tweeters to create spatial audio sound fields, all tuned with Dolby Atmos.\n\nThe Tab Extreme is powered by an octa-core MediaTek Dimensity 9000 processor. Notably, it features an Arm Cortex-X2 core at 3.05GHz for raw power, along with three A710 cores at 2.85GHz for everyday computing tasks, and four A510 cores at 1.8GHz for low-power needs. The tablet ships with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. A massive 12,300mAh battery can push the tablet through 12 hours of video playback, according to Lenovo, and it ships with a high-speed 68W charging brick in the box.\n\n(Credit: Emily Dreibelbis)\n\nSome of the connectivity tools you expect from a pro machine are accounted for. The tablet has two USB-C ports, with one 3.2 Gen 1 with DisplayPort out and the other version 2.0. There's also a microSD card slot to expand storage should you need to. Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 are both on board, as is support for the Lenovo Precision Pen 3, and Tab Extreme Keyboard and Tab Extreme Folio Case (sold separately). There doesn't appear to be a 4G/5G-connected variant, however, which is surprising.\n\nA 13MP front camera with a wide angle of view should help with Zoom calls, while a 13MP and 5MP duo on the rear can handle basic picture-taking duties. A fingerprint reader is built into the power button for biometric security. There are also four directional microphones with 360-degree voice capture for multiple-participant speakerphone calls.\n\nThe Tab Extreme ships with Android 13 and Lenovo says it will receive three full OS upgrades and four years of security patches. A handful of productivity apps are built in, as well as Clip Studio Paint for creative purposes.\n\nThe price is as extreme as the name. The tablet starts at $1,199.99 and it will ship later this year.\n\nTargeting Note-Takers\n\nWith the Lenovo Smart Paper, the company seeks to bring prolific note-takers into its fold. This E Ink-based tablet could be just what some pros or students need to stay on top of their game.\n\n(Credit: Emily Dreibelbis)\n\nThe Smart Paper has a 10.3-inch, anti-glare E Ink touch screen that's nestled into a metal chassis that is still light enough to be an everyday carry item. The monochrome screen's resolution measures 1,872 by 1,404 pixels for a density of 227ppi. There are 24 separate brightness levels as well as 24 adjustable temperature tones to find the right match for the note-taking or reading environment.\n\nLenovo says the screen mimics the pen-on-paper feel note takers are used to. It supports 4,096 levels of pressure and tilt detection with the Lenovo Smart Paper Pen\u2014which never has to be charged. There are nine different pen settings, including ballpoint, pencil, marker, and more. There are also 74 notepad templates for writing, drawing, sketching, shading, and illustrating. PCMag's Emily Dreibelbis commented that it sort of felt like writing on sandpaper.\n\nThe Smart Paper is powered by a RockChip RK3566 quad-core processor with 4GB of RAM and 64B of storage. You'll find a 3,550mAh battery within, which Lenovo claims is good for 7,000 pages worth of reading or 170 pages of note-taking in one charge. A USB-C port is on board for charging. Wi-Fi is available for syncing, and Bluetooth 5.2 with Low Energy helps it connect to select accessories.\n\n(Credit: Emily Dreibelbis)\n\nThe device, which of course doubles as an ereader, runs the Android Open Source Project build of Android 11. It includes some basic apps such as email, calendar, clock, calculator, and eBooks.com. There are two integrated microphones, which can help transform digital voice recordings to written notes. The user-available storage is enough to hold 50,000 note pages. The device can be synced with Android, iOS, and Windows devices when it comes time to manage content.\n\nPricing will start at $399.99 and the Lenovo Smart Paper will reach store shelves later in 2023.", "label": "human"}
{"text": ".. HAVAL, Cuba - The U.S. Embassy in Cuba announced that it has resumed full processing of immigrant visas for the first time since 2017. This marks a major diplomatic shift since Cuba and the United States announced their resumption of diplomatic relations in December 2014. The re-commencement of full processing of immigration visas, as well as the recent announcement of limited direct flights between the two countries, means that bilateral relations have deepened. The U.S. Embassy in Cuba announced earlier this week that it would resume full immigration visa processing in response to President Biden's foreign policy, including expanding people-to-people communication, which would allow U.S. citizens to apply for visas without having to travel to a third country to be interviewed by the State Department. The move would also allow U.S. citizens to apply for family reunification visas in Cuba, which could have a significant impact on Cuban-American families, many of whom have been divided since the United States imposed an embargo on Cuba in the 1960s and banned travel to that country. \"The process of applying for family reunification and other permanent residence visas is much more complicated than before,\" said a State Department official. \"We no longer require applicants to travel to third countries to consider their applications.\" The official added that the State Department is actively working with the Cuban government to ensure that applications are reviewed in a timely manner and that the process will not be interrupted, adding that they now operate regularly and most of the processes are automated. For many families, this will mean a long-awaited reunion. \"I'm glad to know that my relatives in Cuba can come to visit me in the United States,\" said Maria Lopez, a Cuban American living in Miami. \"We waited for a long time and now it has finally happened.\" The resumption of full visa processing is a milestone in the development of relations between the United States and Cuba, indicating progress made by both countries towards improved relations and greater openness. While many issues remain to be resolved between the two countries, it is an important step forward for Cuban Americans who are eager to reunite with their families.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The Inflation Reduction Act signed into law last year could create a boost for stocks from various sectors, and Goldman Sachs broke down its top picks for investors wanting to take advantage. \"We believe stock-specific implications are quite wide-ranging from both an impact and timing perspective across multiple sectors,\" Goldman strategists said in a note. The Wall Street firm screened buy-rated stock ideas \u2014 with many having 50% upside \u2014 from not only clear-cut winners like clean technology, hydrogen and electric vehicles, but also more underappreciated sectors like energy services and financials. Here are the criteria Goldman looked at for IRA plays: Percentage of sales derived in U.S. Percentage of sales benefiting from IRA IRA impact on earnings per share, EBITDA and free cash flow Goldman noted that the IRA marks a meaningful policy development for the solar and energy storage sector and clears the way for a decadelong runway for stable installation growth. First Solar and Enphase were the two top picks in this space, with Goldman predicting 50% upside in the next 12 months for both names. The bill also gives rise to the clean hydrogen economy in the U.S., including carbon capture, Goldman said. The firm highlighted Linde as a top beneficiary. \"For the first time [it] gives hydrogen a strong foundation to play a significant role in the energy system of the country,\" the strategists said. \"We view these incentives together as a major game changer for the sequestration of carbon and production of hydrogen and are a significant benefit for companies with current or planned hydrogen projects in the U.S.\" Electric vehicle players Freyr and Tesla could also be big winners as the law promotes long-term EV adoption while also driving down battery costs, Goldman said. For underappreciated names, Goldman said alternative asset manager Brookfield could be getting a boost as the company is building out its renewables flagship lineup. Meanwhile, Goldman said energy services company MasTec is well positioned to benefit from the demand for infrastructure that supports renewable projects. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting", "label": "human"}
{"text": "It\u2019s also worth putting the amount of carbon involved in having a Christmas tree in context. The Carbon Trust estimates that a 2m-tall (6.6ft) Christmas tree burnt after use emits only 3.5kg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) \u2013 roughly 0.2% of the emissions from a return flight from London to New York. A tree of the same size that ends up in landfill has a carbon footprint of 16kg of CO2e \u2013 equivalent to 1% of that return flight, or roughly two hamburgers.\n\nHow people dispose of their Christmas trees after use is usually the single most important carbon consideration. The worst-case scenario happens when Christmas trees end up in landfill: the anaerobic conditions are conducive to the same carbon being released as methane \u2013 a greenhouse gas some 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide on a 20-year timescale. Whether or not a tree ends up in landfill has by far the largest impact on its carbon footprint: a tree that ends up in landfill emits some 4-5 times as much carbon as one that doesn\u2019t, according to Carbon Trust figures.\n\nIdeally, if a tree is still alive with its roots, it will be replanted. A decent alternative is ensuring the tree's carbon is released slowly back to the atmosphere as CO2 \u2013 as happens if the tree is chipped and spread on a garden or park, or composted. If the tree is burned for energy, meanwhile, the carbon it contains will be emitted straight back to the atmosphere as CO2. The BCTGA also recommends checking whether the place you bought the tree from offers recycling services, allowing it to be chipped and returned to the fields where it grew.\n\nWhole trees can even be used as habitat restoration tools on riverbanks and along shorelines to prevent erosion. In Vermont, where old Christmas trees are used for everything from biomass burning for energy to goat food, \"we're also seeing folks using them in stream restoration,\" says Kosiba. \"They're great at catching dirt and debris, and creating little barriers and pools for fish: a lot of it is mimicking what a beaver would do.\"\n\nAside from disposal, Christmas trees produce greenhouse gases through the fertilisers used to grow them, which are made using fossil fuels and produce nitrous oxide, another powerful greenhouse gas. Meanwhile, managing and harvesting the forests uses fuel, as does transporting the trees to their final location.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Of course, the sights of the sport\u2019s brutality are simply the aspect of this questionable moral arrangement that we bear witness to on game day. Many of football\u2019s most serious dangers are abstracted or unseen. They arrive years later in the form of players suffering from premature dementia, violent mood swings, and suicidal depression. Off the field and away from the action, these are the blemishes that can be hidden away from the tens of millions who watch religiously for a third of the year.\n\n\n\nNaturally, the players understand the risks, but it\u2019s the league\u2019s sheer momentum and ruthless competitiveness\u2014these most American qualities\u2014that renders so many of the players who take these risks expendable, both physically and economically. Last night, ESPN\u2014after minutes of faltering coverage\u2014aired what may have been its most clear-eyed assessment of the dangers of football. Here is what former All-Pro safety Ryan Clark, whose career ended prematurely after he collapsed on a plane due to complications involving the sport and a genetic disorder, had to say on ESPN.\n\n\n\nWhen Damar Hamlin falls to the turf, and when you see the medical staff rush to the field and both teams are on the field, you realize this isn\u2019t normal. You realize this isn\u2019t just football. So many times in this game, and in our job as well, we use the clich\u00e9s: \u201cI\u2019m ready to die for this. I\u2019m willing to give my life for this. It\u2019s time to go to war.\u201d And I think sometimes we use those things so much, we forget that part of living this dream is putting your life at risk. Tonight, we got to see a side of football that is extremely ugly. A side of football that no one ever wants to see and never wants to admit exists. When you see both teams on the field crying in that way, your first thought is Damar Hamlin, your second thought is his family. This isn\u2019t about a football player. This is about a human. This is about a brother. This is about a son. This is about a friend. This is about someone who is loved by so many that you have to watch go through this.\n\nWhat we\u2019ve seen since Hamlin collapsed has run the gamut, exposing all that\u2019s good and ill about this league. The outpouring of support for Hamlin\u2014a hardworking and charitably-minded sixth-round draft pick who has quietly been one of the league\u2019s best success stories this year\u2014has been moving and extraordinary. We are reminded that players who are often treated either as superhumans or as mindless automatons, who come in for hours of abuse on inane morning TV shows, are human beings. That it seems highly likely that the game was ultimately suspended because of collective action from players and coaches who refused to play another down after watching one of their friends and colleagues collapse is similarly moving. But those players and coaches could only halt things momentarily. The sport\u2014and its attendant, inherent costs\u2014will start up again soon and the league will roll on, with or without Damar Hamlin.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Microsoft and Activision announced a massive $69 billion merger that would bring together the world's two most powerful tech companies. After all, both Microsoft and Activision have considerable market power, and the merger will allow them to gain a greater foothold in an already dominant market. But as the dust settled, one name came into focus: Lina Khan, a lawyer who had been pushing regulators to take a tougher stance on the merger, and the Microsoft-Activision deal was a direct challenge to her vision. But it is also a potential benefit to her career. If Khan can stop the Microsoft-Activision deal, she will set the tone for regulators' views on big tech deals in the coming years. In recent years, Khan has been known for tougher antitrust laws. She has been outspoken in her criticism of mergers and acquisitions, arguing that they create a \"disputing power imbalance\" that hurts consumers. The deal between Microsoft and Activision provides Khan with an opportunity to put her views into action. If she succeeds in opposing the merger, it will send a strong signal to regulators and the public that big tech deals should not be taken lightly. Microsoft has established itself as one of the largest companies in the tech industry, and Activision is no exception. The combined company will have a market capitalization of more than $400 billion and control one of the world's most profitable gaming markets. She has already expressed opposition to the deal, arguing that it will lead to fewer options and higher game prices. She also noted that the deal would give the combined company an unfair advantage in the gaming industry, potentially stifling competition. As the debate intensified, regulators seemed to keep Khan's point in mind. Both the Department of Justice and the European Commission have launched investigations into the deal, with New York attorney general threatening to file a lawsuit. Eventually, the threat of investigation and legal action worked. Microsoft and Activision abandoned the deal on the grounds of \"regulatory issues.\" The companies paid a total of $1 billion in fines, although most of it went to the government. Although she has not yet won a major antitrust case, she has shown the power of public pressure. Her advocacy is a key factor in blocking deals and suggests that her views on antitrust are being reached with regulators. Microsoft's deals with Activision may have failed, but there could be more of them in the future. But as long as Lina Khan stands up against them, the future of big tech transactions will be brighter.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nLaw enforcement officials in Brazil will likely reinstate fraud charges against US Rep.-elect George Santos as the New York Republican officially assumes his role in the US House Tuesday under a cloud of suspicion over his dubious resume, the New York Times reported Monday.\n\nAccording to the Times, prosecutors said they will seek a \u201cformal response\u201d from Santos related to a stolen checkbook in 2008, after police suspended an investigation into him after they were unable to find him for nearly a decade.\n\nAuthorities, having verified Santos\u2019 location, will make a formal request to the Justice Department to notify him of the charges, Nathaly Ducoulombier, a spokeswoman for the Rio de Janeiro prosecutor\u2019s office, told the Times.\n\nCNN has reached out to a lawyer for Santos for comment.\n\nThe criminal case, according to the Times, citing court records it has reviewed, stems from a visit Santos made to a small clothing store in Niter\u00f3i, a city outside of Rio de Janeiro, where Santos spent nearly $700 out of the stolen checkbook using a fake name.\n\nCNN previously confirmed reporting from the Times last month that Santos was charged with embezzlement in a Brazilian court in 2011, according to case records from the Rio de Janeiro Court of Justice. However, court records from 2013 state that the charge was archived after court summons went unanswered and they were unable to locate Santos.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Post last week, Santos denied that he had been charged with any crime in Brazil, saying: \u201cI am not a criminal here \u2013 not here or in Brazil or any jurisdiction in the world. Absolutely not. That didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nSantos flipped a Democratic-held seat, helping Republicans win a narrow House majority. And he is set to take office on Tuesday.\n\nThe New York Republican has admitted to lying about parts of his resume after The New York Times first revealed on December 19 that Santos\u2019 biography appeared to be partly fictional.\n\nCNN confirmed details of that reporting about his college education and employment history and uncovered even more falsehoods from Santos, including claims he was forced to leave a New York City private school when his family\u2019s real estate assets took a downturn and that he represented Goldman Sachs at a top financial conference.\n\nSantos\u2019 claims that his grandparents fled the Holocaust as Ukrainian Jewish refugees and that his mother died as a result of being present in the South Tower during 9/11 have also come under scrutiny, CNN\u2019s KFile found.\n\nIn interviews with WABC radio and the New York Post on December 26, Santos admitted to lying about attending Baruch College and New York University as well as misrepresenting his employment at Goldman Sachs and Citigroup but said at the time he still intended to serve in Congress.\n\nTwo days later, CNN reported that the US attorney\u2019s office in the Eastern District of New York had begun investigating the finances of Santos, who faces questions over his wealth and loans totaling more than $700,000 he made to his successful 2022 campaign.\n\nThe same day, the Nassau County district attorney\u2019s office announced it was also looking into fabrications from Santos.\n\n\u201cNo one is above the law and if a crime was committed in this county, we will prosecute it,\u201d Nassau County District Attorney Anne Donnelly said at the time.\n\nThe district attorney\u2019s office did not specify what fabrications it was exploring and the US attorney\u2019s office in the Eastern District of New York declined to comment.\n\nCNN has reached out to a representative for Santos for comment on the probes.\n\nSantos\u2019 FEC reports contain a number of unusual expenditures, including exorbitant expenses on air travel and hotels, as well as a number of expenses one penny below the dollar figure above which the FEC requires campaigns to keep receipts.\n\n\u201cCampaign expenditures for staff members including travel, lodging, and meals are normal expenses of any competent campaign. The suggestion that the Santos campaign engaged in any unlawful spending of campaign funds is irresponsible, at best,\u201d Joe Murray, a lawyer for Santos, said in a statement to CNN on Saturday.", "label": "human"}
{"text": ".. Louisiana's 2023 mortgage limit by county has been determined and is ready for public disclosure. The new limits issued by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) are much higher than those of the previous year. The largest mortgage ceiling is in the Diocese of Orleans, which increased its cap from $585,000 in 2022 to $750,000 in 2023. In addition to the increased mortgage restrictions in the Diocese of Orleans, other Louisiana parishes also saw growth, including Jefferson (585,000 to 678,000), St. Bernard (585,000 to 678,000) and East Baton Rouge (585,000 to 678,000). Most dioceses saw growth, but some had reduced their limits. The largest decline was seen in the Diocese of Tangipah, from $585,000 in 2022 to $487,000 in 2023. According to the National Association of Realtors (NAR), from 2022 to 2023, median home prices across the state increased by 8.5%, which is in line with the trend of a 6.7% increase in median home prices nationwide. The Louisiana Mortgage Limit of 2023 was issued on December 31, 2020 and is determined annually by the Federal Housing and Housing Administration (FHFA) based on median home prices for each parish. The limit is calculated annually based on changes in median house prices for each parish. The Louisiana mortgage limit is higher than the national average, and more in line with the other high-cost areas of the country. For example, the Oregon Diocese's mortgage limit is higher than that of Los Angeles County, California, where it is $730,000. The FHFA also sets an annual mortgage limit for the Family Affordable Refinancing Program (HARP). In 2023, Louisiana's mortgage limit under HARD is $603,000. New mortgage restrictions will give Louisiana homeowners more options to buy a home or refinance existing mortgages. Higher limits may also encourage more people to become owners in the state, giving power to the Louisiana real estate market. Louisiana has already seen a positive trend in the property market, with sales up 4.4% over the previous year. The state's real estate market is expected to continue improving throughout 2023. FHFA sets annual mortgage limits and publishes information on its website. Home owners can also contact their mortgage lenders to learn about the restrictions in their particular county or parish. Louisiana's mortgage limit for 2023 is the highest level in recent years, and should provide potential home buyers with more options to find a home. With higher limits, more people are likely to enter the real estate market, which could lead to increased sales of homes in the state and continued improvements in the housing market.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "\"I got a few episodes [into Bad Sisters ] during a plane ride and am parceling the rest out like little treats so it lasts longer.\"\n\nThis is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.\n\nGood morning, and welcome back to The Daily\u2019s Sunday culture edition, in which one Atlantic writer reveals what\u2019s keeping them entertained.\n\nToday\u2019s special guest is Kate Lindsay, who has written viral Atlantic articles about the Instagram \u201cick\u201d and the \u201cMillennial pause.\u201d (Translation: Instagram is over, and Millennials are aging out of the internet, respectively.) She also talked about the Millennial pause in a viral TikTok and writes a newsletter, Embedded, about internet culture. Kate is savoring The Thursday Murder Club and fighting with her friends about The 1975, and she would follow Sabrina the Teenage Witch anywhere, even Paramount Plus.\n\nBut first, here are three Sunday reads from The Atlantic.\n\nThe Culture Survey: Kate Lindsay\n\nThe upcoming event I\u2019m most looking forward to: My friends and I need to get tickets to see Jodie Comer in the play Prima Facie when it comes to New York City this April. Comer is obviously best known for playing opposite Sandra Oh on Killing Eve, but real heads know her from My Mad Fat Diary. It was her monologue in Snatches that first made me need to see her live. [Related: Killing Eve and the riddle of why women kill]\n\nThe television show I\u2019m most enjoying right now: I have an annoying tendency to get something recommended to me over and over and, when I finally make my way to it, be like, \u201cWhy did no one tell me about this earlier???\u201d Sharon Horgan\u2019s Bad Sisters is one of those things. Based on the Belgian series Clan, this Apple TV+ show is about five sisters, four of whom (maybe) conspired to kill the fifth\u2019s terrible husband. I don\u2019t know yet! I got a few episodes deep during a plane ride and am parceling the rest out like little treats so it lasts longer. As will shortly become apparent, I\u2019m a sucker for a mystery based in the U.K. or Ireland. [Related: The wrath of a woman without any options]\n\nBest novel I\u2019ve recently read: The Thursday Murder Club is the first book in a U.K.-based mystery series of the same name by Richard Osman. I can promise you that no other book about murder will make you feel this warm and fuzzy. Set in a retirement community near Kent, the series follows a group of senior citizens who meet weekly in an attempt to crack unsolved cases, often running into a few present-day mysteries of their own. The characters are loveable, the writing quick and hilarious, and the plot genuinely gripping. And there\u2019s good news for those of you hearing about The Thursday Murder Club for the first time: It\u2019s already three books deep.\n\nAn author I will read anything by: Tana French, who, if you can believe this, writes Ireland-based mystery novels. Six belong to the incredible Dublin Murder Squad series, and her two additional stand-alone novels\u2014The Witch Elm and The Searcher\u2014are just as good. I read all eight in the summer of 2021 and have been waiting patiently for any scrap of news about her next book ever since. In fact, two of my friends have emailed French herself to see if she is working on anything new. I\u2019ll let you know if we ever hear back. [Related: Women are writing the best crime novels.]\n\nMy go-to karaoke song: I\u2019m a recovering a cappella group member, and karaoke is my shameless two minutes in the spotlight. Do not sing along with me; I am performing. And in most cases, it\u2019s Tom Petty\u2019s \u201cFree Fallin\u2019,\u201d because it\u2019s a crowd-pleaser and, most important, comfortably within my vocal range.\n\n\"[Shari Elf\u2019s World Famous Crochet Museum] is small, but the collection is significant.\" (Courtesy of Kate Lindsay)\n\nThe last museum show that I loved: Try as I might, I\u2019m not a huge museum person, but as a knitter, I had to stop by Shari Elf\u2019s World Famous Crochet Museum when I was in Joshua Tree over New Year\u2019s. The space is small, but the collection is significant. [Related: Getting through a pandemic with old-fashioned crafts]\n\nSomething I recently rewatched: I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s ever a time I\u2019m not actively revisiting the late-\u201990s/early-\u201900s sitcom Sabrina the Teenage Witch. I used to come home from school every day to watch it, and it\u2019s the first thing I put on as an adult whenever I need some comfort. The series will have just left Hulu (my most recent binge was in anticipation of this). But I\u2019ll follow that kooky witch, played by Melissa Joan Hart, and her talking cat, voiced by Nick Bakay, anywhere\u2014even Paramount Plus. [Related: How Chilling Adventures of Sabrina thinks about female power]\n\nOnline creators that I\u2019m a fan of: YouTube and TikTok are my primary forms of entertainment, and I\u2019ve followed so many creators for so long that this is a hard answer to narrow down. But now that content creators are somewhat mainstream, I\u2019ll recommend the YouTuber Rachel Nguyen as one who is doing something totally different and refreshing. We recently had a great conversation about creating authentic art in an algorithm-driven world, and her quarantine vlog is proof that online content can be just that: art.\n\nThe last debate I had about culture: Thanks to TikTok, I recently became obsessed with The 1975, and no one in my life is being supportive. I\u2019ve been listening to their new album, Being Funny in a Foreign Language, pretty much nonstop for the past two months, but every time I try to play it among friends\u2014in cars or at dinner parties\u2014I\u2019m soundly overruled. These people insist the music is bad, which is incorrect. It was a tense Friendsgiving.\n\nA poem, or line of poetry, that I return to: I had completely forgotten about this poem until my friend Jehan resurfaced it when we were talking about how much we love the actor Aya Cash. Cash\u2019s mom is the poet Kim Addonizio, who wrote \u201cTo the Woman Crying Uncontrollably in the Next Stall\u201d:\n\n\u201clisten I love you joy is coming\u201d\n\nRead past editions of the Culture Survey with Xochitl Gonzalez, Spencer Kornhaber, Jenisha Watts, David French, Shirley Li, David Sims, Lenika Cruz, Jordan Calhoun, Hannah Giorgis, and Sophie Gilbert.\n\nThe Week Ahead\n\nHouse Party, a comedy directed by Calmatic and produced by Maverick Carter and LeBron James, who also stars as himself (in theaters Friday) Plane, a thriller starring Gerard Butler and Mike Colter (in theaters Friday) Still Pictures: On Photography and Memory, Janet Malcolm\u2019s posthumous memoir (Tuesday)\n\nEssay\n\n(Joanne Imperio / The Atlantic; Claudia Raschke / Sony Pictures Classics; Martha Kaplan / Sony Pictures Classics; Thomas Victor / Sony Pictures Classics)\n\nA Civil War Over Semicolons\n\nBy Gal Beckerman\n\nThe partnership of Robert Caro and Robert Gottlieb is beautifully anachronistic. As writer and editor, respectively, they have together produced 4,888 pages over the course of 50 years, including the multivolume, still unfinished saga that is Caro\u2019s biography of Lyndon B. Johnson. A lasting collaboration of this sort is impossible to imagine in today\u2019s publishing world of constant churn. Then there\u2019s their method: Caro puts on a dark suit every day, writes his drafts out in longhand, and copies them onto carbon paper using his Smith Corona typewriter, after which Gottlieb marks them up with a pencil\u2014like a couple of cobblers still making shoes with an awl. Whatever deal Caro got from Gottlieb and Knopf in the 1970s, it has allowed him to work monastically on this biography project seemingly without any other source of income. As Caro\u2019s longtime agent, Lynn Nesbit, says of the arrangement in Turn Every Page, a new documentary about Caro and Gottlieb, \u201cI doubt that it could ever happen again.\u201d But there\u2019s something else about the relationship that gives a glimpse into another era: The two don\u2019t seem to like each other all that much. They bicker all the time, about every comma, period, and semicolon. Actually, don\u2019t even get them started on semicolons.\n\nRead the full article.\n\nMore in Culture\n\nCatch Up on The Atlantic\n\nPhoto Album\n\n(Patrick Hertzog / AFP / Getty)\n\nCheck out snapshots from a photographer\u2019s visit to the French Southern and Antarctic Lands, home of many penguins, seals, and seabirds.\n\nIsabel Fattal contributed to this newsletter.\n\nExplore all of our newsletters.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Last week, a new wave of tech workers in top-ranking positions at tech giants like Google made headlines when they announced that they would leave their jobs and focus on climate change activities full time. The phenomenon began in October, when a group of Google engineers revealed their intentions in a Medium post. \"We have the ability and opportunity to deal with the world's most pressing problems, and we are taking advantage of that capability,\" the post wrote. The trend has been growing in the months since. So far, about 20 Google employees have left their jobs to focus on climate action. Many of them have good jobs at some of the world's most successful companies, and now they give up these jobs to solve a problem that hasn't even been solved. So why switch? First, many tech workers are passionate about climate change and believe that they can make a difference by focusing on it. Others argue that companies need to be held accountable for their emissions and other climate-destructive activities, and they want to be part of this effort. In addition, some of these technicians feel responsible for their role in the climate crisis. Over the past few decades, rapid advances in technology and artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have helped us increase efficiency and productivity, but also led to increased emissions. As a Google engineer who left his job to join the Climate Action Group explained, \"I feel responsible and guilty about my work's contribution to climate change and global warming, so I wanted to try something with my skills.\" Many still work with their former employers in some capacity, whether through consulting or part-time. This means that they can use their skills and experience to contribute to the fight against climate change while maintaining contact with their former employers. At the same time, this trend also involves self-protection factors. These technicians realize that climate change is already having an impact on the world, and they know that if they do not act now, they may face a more uncertain future. As one Google engineer pointed out, \"Climate change is real and happening faster than many of us think. We're already seeing the effects of rising temperatures and bad weather. It's only going to get worse, so I wanted to do something about it.\" Ultimately, these tech workers are clearly sending a strong message to other tech companies. If big tech companies want to attract and retain top talent, they need to start taking the climate crisis more seriously and tackling the environmental problems created by their products and services. These technicians also send a strong message to the rest of us: It's time for action. With everyone who decides to commit to climate action, we are getting closer and closer to the future, where we can face this crisis and create a better and more sustainable world for everyone.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "L.A., New Orleans - Even though it's only been a week since Crimson Tide's overwhelming loss to Ohio in the semifinal of the sugar bowl college football postseason, there has been speculation about quarterback Blaise Young's future. Young is a Red Shirt high school student who was pushed into the opening role of the 2020 season and immediately showed his special talent, leading to Alabama's 11-0 regular record and SEC title. But it was his performance in the sugar bowl that prompted many to question whether the Los Angeles native would return to his junior year in 2021. Young had one of his worst performances this season, throwing just 183 yards with the interception and two expensive false noises. The question now is: Will he return to first grade in Alabama? Will he announce his participation in the 2021 NFL Draft? Or will he take a different route and transfer to another school to complete his college career? At present, the answers to all these questions are unclear. People close to Yang said he was still weighing his options and had not made any decisions about his future. Throughout the season, Yang has been widely sought after by the NFL and college teams. He has been predicted by some experts and science fiction writers as a first or second round pick for the 2021 NFL draft. One factor that may have affected Yang's return to Alabama, however, is his loyalty to the program. Yang has often talked about his love for coach Nick Saban and Alabama, even saying that he will continue to play in the Crimson Tide even if he is not a starting player. It's clear that Yang's decision in the coming weeks will be a huge moment for him and the Alabama plan. Saban has done an outstanding job for the development of young people over the past two seasons, making him a Heisman trophy finalist. Whether Yang will return to Alabama next season remains to be seen, but regardless of his decision, it's a big deal for him and Crimson Tide.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Residents of a small New England town are calling for gunmen to take care of the growing number of coyotes invading their area. The town of Cumberland in Rhode Island is located outside the state's capital and largest city, Providence. Over the past few months, residents of Cumberland have noticed a dramatic increase in the number of Coyotes seen in their small town. In most cases, these cabins do not pose a threat to residents, and they do very little other than collect food from the yard and occasionally make noise at night. However, in recent weeks things have become even worse. As the number of Coyotes in the region has grown significantly in such a short period of time, local police and animal control officers have begun to worry about the safety of the community.The police department has taken action to set up live traps so that they can try to catch them before they cause any harm. However, local authorities are now considering more extreme measures to address the situation. Earlier this week, the Cumberland City Council held a meeting to discuss the issue and vote on a solution. After lengthy debates, they eventually voted to introduce bayonets to hunt down the remaining Coyotes. The town has hired a local company to handle the work, which will use trained markers to hunt whales safely from a distance and ensure that other wildlife in the area are not harmed. The goal is to reduce the number of whales to a level where they no longer pose a threat to communities. It's not clear how long or how successful this process will take, but many residents in the town are relieved that eventually steps are being taken to address the issue. Cod can be dangerous, so it's important to take steps to protect pets and children. It's also a good idea to securely close the trash bin and ensure that any potential food sources that may attract animals are removed. Ultimately, the arrival of cutting machines may be the only way to solve the Cumberland cod problem. While this seems like a drastic measure, it is an important step in ensuring the safety of communities.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Written by Leah Dolan, CNN Contributors Hanna Pham, CNN\n\nIf you've reached the end of the year feeling as though you didn't read enough, we've got you. Here are some of the best books of the year according to notable authors, artists, image-makers and other cultural tastemakers.\n\nEmily Ratajkowski, model: 'Ghost Lover'\n\nBloomsbury Publishing\n\n\"This collection of nine short stories wrestles with many of the same themes in Lisa Taddeo's beloved 'Three Women,' but in a sharper, nastier way. She ruthlessly explores jealousy, relationships between women, aging, revenge and, of course, desire. Taddeo never lets you come up for air \u2014 making you laugh while simultaneously horrifying you all when you least expect it.\"\n\nOttessa Moshfegh, novelist: 'A Ballet of Lepers'\n\nGrove Press\n\n\"Leonard Cohen has always been one of my creative heroes. I discovered his music when I was a teenager in the 90s, and his deep, gravelly voice, for me, still exemplifies the wisdom and soulfulness that an artist earns after decades of work, a voice so true that it almost feels like an artifact, something carved from stone, immense and permanent. So it was a complete surprise to read fiction that he had written as a very young man, before any of the music I know so well. In 'A Ballet of Lepers,' you get a novel and a collection of short stories Cohen composed between 1956 and 1961. Even in his twenties, he was exploring the themes we know as quintessentially Cohen: romantic love, depression, loss, sexuality, grace. The writing captures all the gorgeous poeticism that we have come to love about his music, as well as a youthful naivete and a playfulness, a rawness that I wouldn't have predicted. There's something so fun in seeing where this all began.\"\n\nJennette McCurdy, author and actor: 'What My Bones Know'\n\nBallantine Books\n\n\"'What My Bones Know' is a striking memoir. Stephanie Foo's voice is singular \u2014 at times poetic, at times biting. A must-read for anyone healing from complex trauma.\"\n\nTheaster Gates, artist: 'To the Realization of Perfect Helplessness'\n\nKnopf\n\n\"Robin Coste Lewis has created a photographic and linguistic archive that draws from the pre-diasporic truth of family \u2014 family before Blackness and before the permutations of misunderstandings by others about 'us.' Her poems never stop offering me ways to more deeply understand the complex ways of being migratory, beautiful and optimistic in times of gross inequity. Lewis creates light and portals that reveal our truth through words and the images underneath our grandmother's bed.\"\n\nHans Ulrich Obrist, curator and artistic director of the Serpentine Galleries: 'I Always Knew'\n\nPrinceton University Press\n\n\"This is a portrait of artist and writer Barbara Chase-Riboud, through the letters she wrote to her mother, Vivian Mae, between 1957 and 1991. In this remarkable title, Barbara Chase-Riboud tells her mother about her development as an artist, her love stories, and her trips around the globe, from Africa to China. In these memoirs, Chase-Riboud candidly and passionately describes her aspirations, her ambitions and creative inspiration, while also showcasing love and tenderness to her mother. Chase-Riboud is a pioneer and her multi-faceted practice explores the timely themes of identity, power and memory. A sculptor, novelist and poet, her career spans more than seven decades and over this time she has been a great inspiration to other artists around the world too. Aligned with Serpentine's goal of spotlighting groundbreaking innovators whose work deserves greater attention, we couldn't be prouder to present the first UK exhibition by Chase-Riboud.\"\n\nDouglas Stewart, novelist: 'Trespasses'\n\nRiverhead Books\n\n\"I absolutely loved 'Trespasses' by Louise Kennedy. Set during the troubles in Northern Ireland, it is the story of Cushla, a young Catholic school teacher who falls for a charismatic older man. Cushla is caught between caring for her alcoholic mother, teaching at the local parochial school and helping run the family pub. She feels stifled until she meets Michael, and her world begins to slowly expand. But not only is Michael married, he is also a prominent Protestant, a Barrister known for defending IRA members.\n\n'Trespasses' is a rare book. By making the political so personal it gives an intimate perspective to life during the Troubles. Cushla's world is so acutely rendered, her inner life so vivid, that as she finds a new freedom with Michael you will genuinely worry for her. You can feel the mounting pressure as Cushla commits various acts of transgression, crossing lines of faith, class and geographical borders. It's impossible not to be gripped by her story.\"\n\nNadia Lee Cohen, photographer and artist: 'Best Seller'\n\nIDEA Books Ltd\n\n'Best Seller' is a meta-fiction novel. It begins 'If I wrote a book it would be a bestseller, and that is what I will call it... BEST SELLER.' I was first drawn to the book after I was invited to create the portrait of the 'author,' June Newton. Plus it's bright pink. The book made me feel like I was June Newton, and I think others should read it so they can feel like her too.\"\n\nMax Richter, composer: 'Sound Within Sound'\n\nFaber\n\n\"I loved this alternative history of 20th century music, Molleson's insightful chronicle of some of the maverick figures who spent their lives expanding the limits of musical languages across the last hundred years or so. Along the way we discover many gems the Canonical version of music history has forgotten about, or simply ignored. What makes the book really special is that it powerfully conveys the passion that drives these people to do what they do; the questions they wrestle with, the trade-offs they make in order to get the work done, the costs \u2014 to themselves and to those around them \u2014 of placing a singular creative pursuit at the center of their lives. 'As artists, our business is curiosity,' said John Cage; Molleson's book gives us a wonderful opportunity to witness that curiosity in action, and so to hear the world anew.\"\n\nAvan Jogia, actor: 'Who is Wellness For?'\n\nHarper Wave\n\n\"'Who is Wellness For?' is a book that works as part social observation and part memoir. It explores the commodification of healing and ritual and asks questions about the industry of wellness. I found the read insightful, thoughtful and unafraid. Wellness isn't for anyone if it's not for everyone\"\n\nSimone Rocha, fashion designer: 'The Pachinko Parlor'\n\nDaunt\n\n\"I enjoyed this book for a few reasons and reading it felt like a pause. It's a story which captures being alien in a place that should feel like home. It's visceral, struggling with one's own identity. There's a lightness and a coldness and a disconnect, which is inviting. A slight sorrow, but a beautiful narration on a time of feeling displaced and out of place, almost in the way.\"\n\nFaye Toogood, furniture designer: 'I am Sparkling'\n\nDamiani\n\n\"I have many books on photography in my library and it's always truly exciting to discover little known artists through new books. This book focuses on the work of N. V. Parekh, an Indian Kenyan photographer working out of Mombasa in the forties through to the seventies. Found in his archive, this series of insightful portraits depict an ethnically diverse cross-section of Mombasa's bourgeoisie \u2014 an urban, largely affluent class that had benefited from the city's postwar prosperity and who took an interest in documenting their own lives.\n\nThe book reminded me of a trip I made to Mali twenty years ago when I was working for The World of Interiors magazine. I visited Malike Sidibe's studio and bought a print from a box of prints being sold by his son. It fascinated me because of how the sitters chose to express and represent themselves through backdrops, props and clothes. Not only is this book a window into a world that is no more, but it's like looking at an early version of social media: the theater of Instagram.\"\n\nElif Batuman, author and journalist: 'I Know What's Best for You'\n\nMcSweeney's\n\n\"Notwithstanding the alarming title and traffic-cone color, 'I Know What's Best for You' is one of the most comforting and exhilarating books I picked up all year. In an antidote to recent US legislation, the authors bring a dazzling array of thematic and stylistic approaches to the subject of 'reproductive freedom.' I particularly loved the fiction by Tommy Orange and Tiphanie Yanique, the play by Donnetta Lavinia Grays, and the poems by Ama Codjoe. It's mind-bending art that probes the relationships between new and existing bodies! For anyone who, as a matter of cognitive survival, might have tuned out the all-out bonkers craziness of the creation of new human life, this book will tap you right back into the magic.\"\n\nHank Willis Thomas, artist: ''Trayvon Generation'\n\nGrand Central Publishing\n\n\"Alexander's 'Trayvon Generation' blurs the line between poetry, biography, historic document, essay and manifesto. It is as timeless as it is timely and urgent as it is eternal.\"\n\nXochitl Gonzalez, author: 'When I Sing, Mountains Dance'\n\nGraywolf Press\n\n\"Irene Sola's 'When I Sing, Mountains Dance' is a book that came into my life this year and has utterly changed it. It's rare to have that happen \u2014 experience a book or a piece of art that chemically alters your vision of the world. But Sola's words \u2014 vibrant, full of life and poetry \u2014 are more like Lasik surgery than rose colored glasses: you see beauty, and also pain, but all of it with new clarity and detail. The novel tells the story of a Catalan mountain valley during the Spanish Civil war from a series of rotating perspectives \u2014 a widow, a poet, thundering clouds, chanterelle mushrooms, a dog watching his owner make love for the first time in years. There is beauty and heartbreak and an attention to the things that surround us that so often are forgotten that it dares you to walk around and notice them yourself.

{"text": "On Sunday, Cincinnati Bengal's wide-screen receiver Tee Higgins opened for the first time after a vicious fight with Damar Hamlin in the third week of the NFL season against Pittsburgh Steelers. Following the incident, Higgins faced media attacks at his first postgame press conference, but remained cohesive and clear throughout the exchange. Although Higgins himself did not participate in the fight, he had previously remained silent and made his first public comment on the incident this week. He expressed gratitude to his teammates for defending him, and praised Josh Allen of Buffalo Bills for attending the game. \"I appreciate it,\" Higgins said, \"and I want to thank Josh Allen for helping me out and speaking. It's great to have someone like this with me during a fight that means so much to me.\" Higgins went on to say that he was responsible for the incident, but would not tolerate any type of non-sporting behavior. \"My teammates got involved because I was disrespected and I took responsibility for my actions in the fight,\" Higgins said. \"But I can't tolerate any non-sports behavior from players on any of our teams. We all play football here, that should be the point.\" Alan was watching the conflict next to him, and he also talked about his involvement in the defense of Higgins. \"I saw what was happening and felt I needed to step in and say something to Damar Hamlin,\" Allen said. \"I think it's important that we remain united as NFL players and take care of each other. That's why I'm there trying to ease the situation.\" The controversy between Higgins and Hamlin led to the removal of two players from the game. Although this incident resulted in a dust storm between the two players, it seems that there was more understanding and appreciation between Higgins and Allen. Aron's presence and support for Higgins underscored the importance of being there when teammates needed them. Higgins expressed gratitude and appreciation for Alan's support. \"I want to thank Josh for standing there for me and coming forward for what he thinks is right,\" Higgins said. The quarrel between Higgins and Hamlin has been a hot topic of discussion among NFL fans, as it is the first time this season that a match between players resulted in shots. The quarrel also sparked discussions about the importance of standing up for teammates and how players should treat each other. Ultimately, the exchange between Higgins and Allen highlighted the spirit of brotherhood that exists among NFL players. Although they may play in different teams, their passion for the sport and mutual respect unite them.", "label": "machine"}

The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also fell 0.7%.\n\nThe moves early Tuesday come after broad-based declines on Friday in a fitting end to Wall Street\u2019s worst year since the Global Financial Crisis in 2008. U.S. stock and bond markets were closed on Monday in observance of New Year\u2019s Day.\n\nThe S&P 500 tumbled 19.4% in 2022, while the Nasdaq Composite wiped out one-third of its value, dropping 33% and closing out its first four-quarter decline since the 2000 dot-com bubble. The Dow fell a comparably modest 9%, holding up better than its index peers but still capping a three-year winning streak for the major averages.\n\nOptimism around China's recovery after researchers in Shanghai reported COVID cases in major Chinese cities may have peaked helped boost sentiment early Tuesday morning.\n\nShares of Chinese companies trading on U.S. exchanges pushed forward, with Alibaba Group (BABA) and Baidu (BIDU) each rising at least 5%.\n\nBlock's (SQ) stock rose 2% following an upgrade from Baird analysts to Outperform, with a new price target of $78 per share, up from the prior $62.\n\nTesla (TSLA) remained in the limelight to start the year after the electric carmaker on Monday reported record production and deliveries for vehicles in the fourth quarter, but still missed Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Shares of Tesla plunged nearly 10%.\n\nThe company closed out its worst year on record in 2022, shedding 65% or about $700 billion in market value. In December, growing concerns around production delays in China and CEO Elon Musk\u2019s management of Twitter drove the stock down 36%, its biggest monthly drop since Tesla went public in 2010.\n\nIn other markets early Tuesday, U.S. Treasury yields retreated.

{"text": "Minneapolis CNN \u2014\n\nFriday\u2019s jobs report is expected to show that the US economy added 200,000 jobs in December, with the unemployment rate holding steady for the third-straight month at 3.7%.\n\nThe Labor Department\u2019s final monthly employment tally for 2022 likely brings with it some familiar storylines.\n\n\u2014 Job growth is expected to remain robust, although slower than the breakneck pace of historically high job gains during the early stages of economic recovery from the pandemic.\n\n\u2014 Workers are still not returning to hard-hit sectors such as leisure and hospitality, public service and child care.\n\n\u2014 The strong labor market, while it keeps the economy churning, is a little too consistently vigorous for the Federal Reserve\u2019s needs to reduce inflation by tempering demand.\n\n\u2014 The tight labor market needs more workers, and wage growth still hasn\u2019t returned to pre-pandemic levels, which would help quell fears of a wage-price spiral, when higher wages cause price increases that in turn cause higher wages.\n\nLather, rinse and repeat.\n\n\u201cThe preponderance of evidence suggests that the labor market is still nowhere near back to normal,\u201d said Julia Pollak, senior economist with ZipRecruiter online employment marketplace.\n\nHistorically tight\n\nThe US labor market remains atypically tight \u2014 something that was reinforced Wednesday when the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report for November. It showed there were still north of 10.5 million job openings, or about 1.7 available positions for every unemployed person looking for work.\n\nThe survey also showed that what has been deemed the \u201cGreat Resignation\u201d is still chugging along, Pollak said. During the Covid-19 pandemic, a record number of workers voluntarily quit their jobs in search of greener pastures \u2014 be it better working conditions, higher pay, or increased flexibility.\n\nThe number of people per month quitting their jobs has now landed above 4 million for 18 months straight. In the two decades leading up to the pandemic, the monthly average was 2.6 million.\n\nA \"Now Hiring\" sign is displayed on a storefront in Adams Morgan Neighborhood on October 07, 2022, in Washington, DC. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\n\u201cCompanies are still battling huge retention difficulties,\u201d Pollak said.\n\nThe latest JOLTS didn\u2019t show that the market was loosening up as maybe some had hoped or expected. But it did provide a window into some of the divergence that\u2019s occurring at a time when some businesses are hiring more to meet consumer demand while others scale down their operations because of bloat, the rippling effects of high interest rates, or preparation for less fruitful economic times ahead.\n\nIndustries such as accommodation and food services reported about 50% fewer layoffs in November than what was seen on average between 2000 and February 2020, Pollak said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s mostly just pre-pandemic recovery,\u201d she said. \u201cLeisure and hospitality is still short hundreds of thousands of workers and just still ramping up, because spending recovered more quickly than staffing.\u201d\n\nAs of October 2022, the leisure and hospitality sector was still below pre-pandemic employment levels by more than 1 million jobs, or 6.3%, according to a CNN Business analysis of BLS employment data.\n\nCuts and freezes\n\nTechnology companies have accounted for the lion\u2019s share of job cuts announced in recent months. During the pandemic, when people were relegated to working and spending their money from home, tech and e-commerce firms bulked up to meet the demand.\n\nDuring 2022, technology was the leading job-cutting industry, with 97,171 reductions announced, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas\u2019 latest job cut announcement report released Thursday.\n\nOverall, job cuts trended upward in 2022 at 363,824 as compared to 321,970 the year before. There were 43,651 job cuts announced in December, a 129% jump from December 2021, according to the report.\n\nBut the job cuts announced in 2022 were the second-lowest on record, going back to 1993, Challenger, Gray & Christmas data showed. In 2019, there were 592,556 job cuts announced.\n\n\u201cThe overall economy is still creating jobs, though employers appear to be actively planning for a downturn,\u201d Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in the report.\n\nSecond-best year on record for job growth\n\nIf the monthly job gains come in as expected on Friday, that would mean the economy added more than 4.5 million jobs in 2022.\n\nThat would be the second-highest annual total on record, behind the massive 6.7 million gains in 2021, which of itself was a pendulum swing from a record 9.2 million job losses in 2020, BLS data shows.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Reserve would like to see a [monthly job growth] number closer to 100,000 or below that,\u201d said Nick Bunker, economic research director for North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab. \u201cThat\u2019s more in line with a clearly cooling labor market.\u201d\n\nDrivers wait in traffic during the morning rush hour commute in Los Angeles, California on February 23, 2022 Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEconomists are also expecting average hourly earnings growth to slow on a monthly and year-over-year basis, to 0.4% and 5%, respectively, according to Refinitiv.\n\nWage gains, although outpaced by inflation, remain well above pre-pandemic averages and beyond what the Fed wants to see in its price-busting campaign. Chair Jerome Powell, while acknowledging that the wage increases did not cause inflation to spike to the highest levels in 40 years, has repeatedly noted that persistent wage growth in such a tight labor market could keep inflation levels elevated.\n\n\u201cThis is a set of labor market data that for workers and job seekers, [continued, strong nominal wage growth] it\u2019s very much positive news,\u201d Bunker said. \u201cBut for central bankers, they see this as a problem.\u201d\n\nInflation has started to come down in recent months, with key gauges showing declines. But for the Fed to reach its desired target of 2% inflation, the labor market will have to take a hit, with unemployment rising to about 4.6% this year, according to the central bank\u2019s projections released in December.\n\n\u201cThe fact that inflation appears to be cooling down without the labor market taking a significant hit is a sign that a lot of this very high inflation was not driven by the labor market and that it is possible for inflation to be coming down from these levels without the labor market taking a hit,\u201d Bunker said.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s unclear how far inflation can fall without the labor market deteriorating, or rather, it\u2019s not clear what the underlying pace of inflation is with the labor market this tight.\u201d\n\n\u2014CNN\u2019s Matt Egan contributed to this report.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The film is tied with Warner Bros.' \"The Batman,\" which also generated $134 million during its domestic opening in March, as the fifth-highest opening of the year, according to data from Comscore.\n\nThe film snared $134 million at the domestic box office during its opening weekend, short of the $175 million that industry analysts had predicted, and just under the $135 million to $150 million range that Disney had forecast.\n\nJames Cameron's \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" fell short of lofty box office expectations, but international ticket sales spark hope that the long-awaited sequel could still pull in a substantial global haul.\n\n\"Because most people are loving the film, the sugar high of that enthusiasm inspired some opening weekend predictions that the historical data and various headwinds for the film don't support,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. \"That said, 'The Way Of Water' has many factors working in its favor that ensure its long-term prospects for massive global success.\"\n\nNotably, China accounted for $57.1 million in ticket sales for the three-day opening weekend.\n\nThe Chinese box office contributed around $265 million to \"Avatar's\" global tally a decade ago, but the market has grown significantly since. Prior to the pandemic, China was the second-highest-grossing theatrical market in the world. Since cinemas reopened in the country, it has been one of the fastest markets to recover and generate box office success.\n\nIn 2009, China's overall box office reached $910 million. A decade later, it topped $8 billion.\n\nBox office analysts aren't concerned with the movie's smaller-than-expected domestic box office, particularly because of how it has played internationally. The original \"Avatar,\" which was released in 2009, only made $77 million during its opening weekend, but went on to become the highest-grossing film of all time. It maintains that title thanks to several rereleases.\n\nThe first film had incredible staying power at the box office, running in theaters through August 2010, a staggering 234 days. \"Avatar\" ultimately generated $760 million in the U.S. and Canada and more than $2 billion from international markets during its initial theatrical run.\n\n\"Although the film is opening on the low end of expectations, it's important to again emphasize the long-term outlook,\" said Shawn Robbins, chief media analyst at BoxOffice.com. \"Audiences are showing a strong preference to see the film in premium formats, factoring into the volatility noted in pre-release forecasts.\"\n\nRobbins noted that the upcoming holiday corridor and a lack of competition in the market positions \"The Way of Water\" for a more back-loaded box office than a typical blockbuster.\n\nPremium formats, which include IMAX, Dolby Cinema and Motion auditoriums accounted for 62% of all tickets sold. A whopping 57% of that total was for 3D tickets. Premium format tickets are more expensive than traditional tickets.\n\n\"The Way of Water\" 3D tickets averaged $16.55 each while 2D cost $12.62 a piece, according to data from EntTelligence.\n\n\"It's premature to qualify the film's degree of success at this stage, especially with Cameron's history of long runs at the global box office,\" Robbins added.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - There are no \"substantive\" settlement discussions under way between the Biden administration and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to resolve a legal dispute over the Xbox maker's $69 billion bid for games maker Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O), a Federal Trade Commission attorney said on Tuesday.\n\nThe FTC, which enforces antitrust law, asked a judge to block the transaction in early December, arguing it would give Microsoft's Xbox exclusive access to Activision games, leaving Nintendo consoles and Sony Group Corp's (6758.T) PlayStation out in the cold.\n\nFTC attorney James Weingarten, speaking in a brief telephonic pretrial hearing, said there were no \"substantive\" settlement discussions between the two sides under way.\n\nMicrosoft argues that the deal would benefit gamers and gaming companies alike, offering to sign a legally binding consent decree with the FTC to provide \"Call of Duty\" games to rivals including Sony for a decade.\n\nThe case reflects the muscular approach to antitrust enforcement being taken by the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden. But antitrust experts say the FTC faces an uphill battle to convince a judge to block the deal, because of the voluntary concessions offered by Microsoft to allay fears it could dominate the gaming market.\n\nMichael Chappell, the FTC administrative law judge, will rule on the deal after hearings set for August 2023. Either side can then appeal to the same FTC commissioners who voted to bring the challenge, and then to a U.S. appeals court.\n\nThe deal faces scrutiny in the European Union which is to decide by March 23 whether to clear or block the deal.\n\nReporting by Diane Bartz in Washington Editing by Matthew Lewis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "That said, it's clear that asking someone \"Who are you?\" can be uncomfortable and, as many have pointed out, even discriminatory. But when asked such a question, what do people with multiracial backgrounds - or members of minorities - really think? In recent years, many people of color (POCs) have shared how much harm racially insensitive comments can do. The purpose may not be to offend others, but people from different backgrounds may not always recognize the meaning or impact of words or gestures. To get a deeper understanding of POCs, especially those from multi-racial backgrounds, how they feel when asked \"What are you?\" we asked several people to consider this question. Gail Christopher, founder of Ntide, a multigenerational equity nonprofit, said such issues are particularly difficult for individuals whose backgrounds aren't clearly defined. \"Those of us who have a multi-ethnic heritage often struggle with this issue because we are a complex mix of cultural heritage and culture, and we usually feel like we don't have a clear answer,\" said Christopher. For many, these types of queries further complicate their personal identities, especially for those who have struggled to understand their background or heritage. \"When we're asked 'what are you?', we often feel like we're being reduced to a single race or ethnic group and our heritage and culture is being ignored,\" Christopher said. Katherine Ceniza Choy, a professor of race studies at the University of California, Berkeley, said in an email that when multiracial people are asked to define their identity, \"it can be a psychologically painful experience\" because it means they cannot correctly define themselves. \"That means they need to be 'labeled' or sorted by someone else,\" she said. When it comes to race, we often think of identity in binary terms - such as whites, blacks, Hispanics, Asians, Native Americans or Pacific Islanders - but the reality is that identity is more complex than that. A box on a government form isn't always explainable. \"It's important to remember that a large portion of the population is mixed and multiracial,\" Choy said, adding: \"Many people with mixed blood have difficulty negotiating two or more racial/ethnic heritage and cultures in one institution.\" She added that the difficulty becomes more complicated when they are asked to choose one race over another, as often happens when filling out an application or other form. \"We need to recognize the dynamic mix of race and ethnic identity that many people experience,\" Choy said, adding: \"Ethnic identity is fluid and can change over time. Angel Chudabala, an actor from Los Angeles, said he had been reluctant to talk about his mixed-racial identity for years. His mother is Latino and his father is Thai, but he has struggled to answer questions about his \"true\" identity. \"The first time I had to check the box of my ethnic identity, I was frozen and didn't know what to do,\" Chudabala said. These experiences can lead to long-term confusion and a sense of alienation. Chudabala recalls a case in which he felt like being picked out by another customer at a restaurant. \"I remember one time when I went out to dinner with my mom and another restaurant asked me in an aggressive way, 'What are you?' It was disarming because I felt like I had to answer that question while the other person had a right to know.\" Indeed, it has become increasingly commonplace as the racial and ethnic diversity of the American population grows. Given the tensions over the past few years, it is understandable why people of color feel uncomfortable when asked about their heritage. However, it is important to recognize that a simple problem can have lasting effects on a person's sense of identity and even safety.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Tesla Inc. is about to enter a highly dramatic period as it navigates one of its most important markets. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has long said the electric car maker's future depends on its performance in China, which is preparing to make the country the largest market outside of the United States. But analysts warn that Tesla faces a series of problems in the Chinese market, facing months of \"painful periods.\" These include increased competition from local players and high production costs, as well as the need to resolve longstanding tariff and subsidy disputes with the Chinese government. In the long run, China accounts for more than a third of Tesla's total global sales and has been its largest market in the past two years. As of 2020, Tesla has sold more than 400,000 vehicles in the country, generating over $20 billion in revenue. China is also one of the few markets where Tesla has been able to make a profit, in part due to the country's large population of wealthy car buyers and generous subsidies for electric vehicles. The Chinese government has recently cut subsidies for electric vehicles, effectively depriving Tesla of one of its key competitive advantages. This move is seen as a way to help domestic automakers, who are entering the EV market. It has yet to open its much-anticipated Gigafactory plant in Shanghai, which analysts believe will help reduce production costs. The facility is expected to be completed by the end of this year, but some analysts warn that it may take years before it becomes fully operational. What's more, Tesla is in the midst of a long-running trade dispute with the Chinese government, which has been caught in the middle of a U.S.-China trade war where the government imposed tariffs on some of its vehicles. The dispute put pressure on the company's bottom line and raised questions about its long-term profitability. These issues are worrying investors, whose shares have been volatile in recent weeks. Some analysts even predict a bear market for Tesla in the coming months. First, the company can continue to focus on its core business and try to outperform competitors in China. That means strengthening production and marketing efforts, as well as expanding its retail footprint in the country. In addition, Tesla could seek opportunities to work with the Chinese government and find more favorable terms for its trade dispute. Given the divisive nature of the trade war between the two countries, this may be a difficult recommendation, but it may be the company's only way to ensure its long-term future in the Chinese market. Ultimately, the next few months could be critical for Tesla, which has established itself as a market leader in China but now faces some issues that could seriously affect its performance in the country. How Tesla responds to these challenges may be key to its long-term success.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "On January 2, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives held a first floor vote for the new Congress, which was a disaster for House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. In an effort to curb his party's growing divisions, McCarthy proposed a rule that would increase discipline in the House, allowing leaders to \"condemn\" members who did not speak. The incident revealed how divided House Republicans are, and how little McCarthy controls his core group. His reputation has been damaged in recent months as the party's internal conflicts have escalated, with the vote clearly reminding him that he is no longer the undisputed leader of the House Republican Party. The vote also shows that McCarthy's political wealth has suffered in recent months as ideological divisions between moderate Republicans and the party's hard-line conservative deepen. The rejection of the McCarthy proposal marked the first time in decades that a top Republican leader in the House had seen his authority tested and ultimately rejected. The incident was a disaster for McCarthy, who relied on the success of this proposal to prove his ability to lead an increasingly divided core group. Last December, the Republican leader said he intended to fight the chaos on the floor by introducing a resolution that would allow him to \"condemn\" any non-speaking member. McCarthy's proposal immediately sparked strong opposition from hard-line Republicans, who saw the measure as a way to limit their ability to speak out in the House. In a letter to colleagues, Rep. Matt Gates (R-FL) warned that the proposal could be used to remove dissent, accusing McCarthy of trying to exercise \"dictatorial control\" over the core group. Other Republicans have expressed their concerns about McCarthy's proposal, arguing that it violates the party's long tradition of promoting free speech. McCarthy tried to downplay the controversy, claiming that the proposal was only intended to bring order and had nothing to do with stifling dissent. But his efforts did not help, as the measure was rejected by 143 votes to 93. The vote was a clear reminder of how divided House Republicans are and how little McCarthy controls his party. It also highlighted the party's deep ideological divide in recent years, with moderate Republicans increasingly at odds with hard-line conservatives. The battle over the McCarthy proposal reflects growing tensions within the party, and suggests that House Republicans could be taken over by a hard-line conservative group that does not attach much importance to their traditional norms. This could have serious implications for the party's future, as it may push the moderate out of the GOP, making it harder for the party to win support in the House. McCarthy's future as leader of the House Republican Party is now being questioned. The incident is an embarrassing condemnation of his leadership and highlights his increasingly fragile grip on the party. It remains to be seen whether McCarthy can weather the storm and regain control of the core group, but it is clear that the party's split will not be easily cured.", "label": "machine"}

Buchanel defeated the Raiders, along with the Philadelphia Eagles defeating Washington Football 20-14, winning a place in the playoffs for the first time since 2007. The Buchanel team, led by 43-year-old Brady, is the first team in NFL history to reach the playoffs in the middle of the season and they have a record of failing to enter the game. Meanwhile, the Giants took their place in the playoffs after the Green Bay Packers beat the Chicago Bears by 35-16 on Sunday. The Tigers, who have a normal season score of 8-8, will join the NFC Eastern Champions Washington Football Club, Saints and Rams at the playoffs. Buchanel's historic victory was created by Brady's two fourth quarter shots and some of the late game heroes from receiver Mike Evans, who received a two-yard shooting pass that left Buchanel ahead in just two minutes. Evans captured only four times that day, was beaten by teammates while hitting back and said: \"This is the best I've ever done. Buchanes' defense was also important for Brady, as defender Ravinte David made a crucial fourth drop with Josh Jacobs at the end of the fourth quarter. \"We just found a way to make the script, it's an incredible feeling,\" Brady said at the end of the game. \"We knew that going into this match would require good performance in order to enter the playoffs, and I think we did.\" Buchanel will face the Saints in a wild card round, while the Giants will face the ram in Los Angeles. The Eagles and Washington F.C. will also compete in the Wild Kart race, where they will face each other in Philadelphia next Sunday, while the Bears and the Packers will fight on Green Bay next Saturday. The win was Brady's 33rd in his career, the most in NFL history, but he said playoffs have always been a goal. \"It has always been our goal, it took us a while to get here,\" he said, \"but we were able to put it together and play some good football in the second half of the season so that we could go into the playoffs and it felt great to have achieved this.\" Buchanel players who have won seven of their last eight games will now try to capture their momentum in the playoffs and go deep. \"It's an important moment for us,\" said coach Bruce Ariennes, \"but it's just the beginning and now we have to keep going every game once and keeping our focus on the next opponent. We still have a lot of work to do, but it's a huge step for this organization.\" Now the question is, can Tom Brady and Buchanel play a deep game and make history?", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The dollar continued its year-long bull market on Friday, backed by optimism that a strong U.S. labor market and robust economic growth would provide further support for the world's largest economy. According to the Labor Department, the greenback is in favor of a basket of major currencies, with non-agricultural wages rising by more than $312,000 after a month of strong labor markets in December. This positive news has also been fueled by the Fed's optimistic outlook. The central bank, led by chairman Jerome Powell, raised its economic forecast for this year to 3% - the highest level since the Great Depression. Strong U.S. economic data, particularly on the labor market, reinforces the view that a strong dollar as the world's reserve currency should remain bullish for the foreseeable future. The US dollar index, which tracks the performance of greenback against a basket of currencies, rose 0.2% to 97.99. The euro weakened against the dollar, falling 0.3% at $1.1401, while the yen also weakened, trading 0.3% against the greenback by 112.86%. Positive labor market data is also a major driver of the dollar, as it shows that despite the market turmoil in 2018, the country's economy continues to create new jobs at a steady pace. Data from December showed that the unemployment rate was stable at 3.9 percent, while average hourly earnings rose by 3.2 percent. \"A strong U.S. labor market combined with the optimism that came from Powell's remarks helped support a greenback,\" said Brad Bechtel, Jeffreys monetary analyst. \"The December jobs report reflects the underlying strength of the economy, suggesting that the dollar should remain strong in the short to medium term,\" he added. The strong performance of the U.S. dollar also came as major global central banks took action to slow interest rate hikes after turmoil following last September's Fed rate hike. The European Central Bank cut its key interest rates to record lows this week, while Japan's central bank announced it would not raise them in 2019, signaling that it is willing to maintain its ultra-easier monetary policy. The dollar's strength has also been helped by a surge in US asset demand. Investors have been drawn to the returns of corporate tax cuts, which have spurred business investment and consumer spending, while the prospect of an additional $1 trillion in infrastructure spending has boosted confidence in the economy. The U.S. economy is expected to remain robust in 2019, with a vibrant labor market and strong growth forecasts continuing. As a result, the dollar's strengthening trend is likely to continue, with investors viewing green currencies as safe haven assets during periods of global uncertainty.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "New York CNN Business \u2014\n\nNew retirement rules could make it easier for Americans to accumulate retirement savings \u2014 and less costly to withdraw them \u2014 if lawmakers pass a retirement reform package before the end of the month.\n\nThe House already passed its own version of retirement plan rule changes, and two key Senate committees passed their own versions. Since the summer, lawmakers have been trying to stitch the three bills together into one large package known as Secure 2.0.\n\nAfter it\u2019s finalized, one idea is to attach that package to an overall government spending bill that may be voted on by both chambers in Congress before the holidays. But if lawmakers can\u2019t agree on such an omnibus spending bill, Secure 2.0 likely would have to be reintroduced next year for the new Congress\u2019 consideration.\n\n\u201cThe House and Senate have been working to come to an agreement and are close to one \u2014 the final bill is almost there,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin, who co-sponsored the bill passed by the Senate Finance Committee, in an emailed statement. \u201cBut the question is what vehicle will get it across the finish line. We absolutely need to ensure it is a priority.\u201d\n\nWhile the details are still under wraps and no legislative language has been released, here\u2019s a look at seven of the savings provisions very likely to make it into any final retirement package, according to two retirement policy experts who have been following the process closely \u2014 Chris Spence, head of federal government relations at TIAA; and Brigen Winters, a principal and policy practice chair at the law firm Groom Law Group.\n\n1. Require auto enrollment in 401(k) plans\n\nEmployers starting new workplace retirement savings plans could be required to automatically enroll employees in the plan. (It is currently optional for employers to do so.) It would then be up to the employee to actively opt out if they don\u2019t wish to participate.\n\nThe provision would likely require a default contribution rate (e.g., between 3% and 10%) plus automatic escalation (e.g., of 1% per year up to a maximum contribution rate of at least 10% but no more than 15%).\n\n2. Introduce employer contributions for student loan payments\n\nWhen you have to pay down student loan debt, it makes it harder to also save for retirement. Secure 2.0 could let employers make a matching contribution to an employee\u2019s retirement plan based on their student loan payments. That way, it would ensure that the employee is building retirement savings no matter what.\n\n3. Increase the age for required minimum distributions\n\nIt used to be that when you turned 70-1/2 you had to start withdrawing a required minimum amount from your 401(k) or IRA. Then, the age moved up to 72. Under the latest legislation, you likely would not need to tap your retirement savings until age 75 if you did not wish to.\n\n4. Help employees build and access emergency savings\n\nNormally if you tap your 401(k) before age 59-1/2, you must not only pay taxes on that money, but also pay a 10% early-withdrawal penalty.\n\nFor employees who are dissuaded from saving money in a tax-deferred retirement plan because they are concerned it would be too complicated and costly to access it for emergencies, Secure 2.0 may include one or two options to assuage that fear.\n\nOne option would let you make a penalty-free withdrawal of up to $1,000 a year for emergencies. While the employee would still owe income tax on that withdrawal in the year it\u2019s made, they could get that money back if they repay the amount they withdrew within three years, Winters said.\n\nAnother might let an employer add a \u201csidecar account\u201d to an employee\u2019s retirement account, where the employee can contribute after-tax money explicitly for emergencies, Spence said. That money could be taken directly from their paycheck, just as their 401(k) contributions are.\n\n5. Raise catch-up contribution limits for older workers\n\nCurrently, if you\u2019re 50 or older you may contribute an additional $6,500 to your 401(k) on top of the $20,500 annual federal limit. Under the retirement package, those between ages 60 and 64 (the final range may be narrower) may be allowed to contribute $10,000, instead of $6,500.\n\nTo help pay for the cost of the retirement package, however, another provision could require anyone making catch-up contributions to \u201cRothify\u201d them. So, instead of making before-tax contributions up to the catch-up contribution limit, you could still contribute the same amount but it would have to be with after-tax money. That money would then grow tax free and may be withdrawn tax free in retirement. But the federal government would get the tax revenue from the original contribution up front.\n\n6. Enhance and simplify the Saver\u2019s Credit\n\nAn underutilized federal match exists for low-income earners\u2019 retirement contributions up to $2,000 a year. The new retirement package might enhance and simplify the so-called Saver\u2019s Credit so more people could use it. Low-income filers could get a refundable tax credit worth 50% of their savings up to a contribution limit in a given year.\n\nTax credits reduce your tax liability dollar for dollar. But refundable tax credits mean the filer will get the money even if they had no income tax liability to reduce.\n\n7. Make it easier for part-time workers to save\n\nThere will soon be new retirement rules in place that will make it easier for Americans to accumulate retirement savings \u2013 and make it less costly to withdraw them \u2013 now that lawmakers have passed an omnibus spending package, which President Joe Biden is expected to sign next week.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Next year should be a pivotal one for clean energy companies \u2014 and certain stocks are poised to stand out in the crowd, according to JPMorgan. Supply constraints and Covid-related dislocations have made for a difficult 2022 for clean energy names, analyst Bill Peterson said. Those headwinds will abate further into 2023, but companies will also be contending with rising interest rates and a potential recession. \"While a weakening macro could present new challenges, as demand could be dampened, potentially delaying energy transition efforts, we still anticipate significant growth and inflection points and/or initial adoption across clean transport sub-sectors,\" Peterson wrote in a note Thursday. Specifically, he expects hydrogen and electric-vehicle charging infrastructure enablers to outperform. His top picks are Plug Power and ChargePoint . Both names will likely have strong demand even in a macroeconomic slowdown, have a clear path to drive margin expansion and have sufficient cash and liquidity to fund the business plan, Peterson said. Hydrogen company Plug Power is a leader in the emerging global hydrogen ecosystem, Peterson said. Positive catalysts for the business include Plug's green hydrogen and electrolyzer segments, as well as the growing mobility and stationary power segments, he said. \"The company continues to innovate, pursue global partnerships and acquisitions, and win customer bookings across its lines of business,\" Peterson wrote. He said the company is well positioned to meet its 2026 revenue and margin guidance of $5 billion and 17%, respectively. The stock is down 46% year to date. In the EV charging space, ChargePoint is poised to benefit from increasing demand, Peterson said. The company provides charging hardware, software and services to site hosts and already has an expansive footprint of 350,000 ports in the U.S. and Europe, he pointed out. \"The added investments in its go-to-market efforts are key to seed its target markets. Thus, the reward should be strong, sustainable growth within an expanding customer base as the EV market expands,\" Peterson wrote. The stock has lost nearly 41% so far this year. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "This article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME\u2019s politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox.\n\nWhen Joe Biden was a candidate to be his party\u2019s nominee for President, he ran as one of the biggest foes of fossil fuels ever to make a credible run for the White House. He pledged to eliminate net carbon emissions by 2050, ween the country off dirty sources of energy and \u201cend fossil fuel.\u201d He canceled the high-profile Keystone XL pipeline, took millions of acres of possible drilling off the table by scrapping leases to oil and gas companies, and banned imports of Russian oil. He even threatened oil firms with a windfall tax and likened them to war profiteers.\n\nEnvironmental groups went gaga over his rhetoric and action alike, buoying his political alliances and giving climate change activists heart after years of broken promises.\n\nAnd yet, a unique alignment of political and geological confluences may spur Biden in the coming days to do something that will leave those same green allies seeing red.\n\nBiden\u2019s administration is nearing a final decision on a potentially game-changing oil and gas project that has now been under consideration across five presidencies. The proposed Willow project in the northeast section of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska would produce 180,000 barrels of oil each day, create $10 billion in tax and royalty revenues, and create 2,000 construction jobs and 300 permanent ones. The massive project would require as many as five drilling sites, a processing facility, 50 miles of new roads, seven bridges, and an airstrip.\n\nLocal groups, including those representing Alaska Natives, as well as labor unions and the state\u2019s congressional delegation, have all championed the project as a source of good union jobs and money for Alaska\u2019s North Slope.\n\nBut environmental groups and some Native American groups from the Lower 48 oppose the ConocoPhillips project, citing an Interior Department analysis that estimates it would emit at least 278 million metric tons of carbon dioxide over its lifetime and during construction. It also would endanger the local wildlife like polar bears. On Thursday, a coalition of environmental groups\u2014represented by a PR firm with deep ties to the Biden Administration\u2014plans to rally at Lafayette Square across from the White House before delivering another 90,000 comments in opposition to the proposal, which they liken to 76 coal plants running for a year. (Industry groups heartily reject this comparison, noting it compares a lifetime of direct and indirect emissions from Willow with one coal plant\u2019s annual emissions.)\n\nMore from TIME\n\nIf they can\u2019t kill it, the green groups are pushing a scaled-back project, one that would cut three of the proposed five drill sites and better protect calving grounds for the Teshekpuk Lake caribou.\n\nA White House spokesman did not have an immediate comment.\n\nThe Willow proposal dates back to 1999, when the Clinton Administration signed the lease on Alaska\u2019s North Slope. Oil wasn\u2019t discovered there until 2017, and the Trump Administration quickly approved the project. Biden\u2019s team seemed to agree with that thinking, at least until a judge said the environmental costs were not adequately considered and environmental groups separately sounded alarms. A Department of Interior draft impact study released in July appeared to game out how to move forward with the project, although supporters and opponents alike stressed that it was still very much in flux.\n\nThere\u2019s good reason to suspect Biden is poised to make a decision on the Willow project. Because of Alaska\u2019s treacherous conditions, much of the construction needs to happen during the winter months, when the roads are frozen and can accommodate heavy traffic. Warmer temperatures create messy roads that could pause work. In other words, if Biden doesn\u2019t sign off on the project soon, it will languish for another year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re running out of time to be able to do construction this winter,\u201d says Nagruk Harcharek, the new president of Voice of the Arctic Inupiat, a regional council advocating for North Slope communities. \u201cA lot of the construction on the North Slope requires the winter season for ice roads. And if we get too far into February, they\u2019ll have to put it off until next year.\u201d\n\nThat would mean delayed\u2014if not totally unrealized\u2014revenue for local governments and allies, the kind of money that proponents say could prove transformative for a region that isn\u2019t exactly teeming with new opportunities. \u201cWe want to be able to live in the communities that we have so that we can then practice our subsistence culture and be able to go out and hunt in our lands that we grew up on,\u201d Harcharek told me last week. \u201cI remember growing up as a kid, we used to have honey buckets and we\u2019d have to haul those out. Now we can flush our toilets.\u201d\n\nBiden, coming off a less-disappointing-than-expected midterm election season, may be better positioned to disappoint environmental groups than at any point in his presidency. The 2022 elections are barely in his rearview mirror, the 2024 races are still distant, and he can afford to take some incoming criticism from his friends. His allies are bracing for a potential decision, even if they still defend his broader environmental record as one to celebrate.\n\nPlaying into Biden\u2019s decision-making here is the different promises he made as a candidate. While waging rhetorical war on the fossil fuel industry, he also vowed to listen to local communities, including Alaska Natives. As President, he promised to consider Native Americans\u2019 requests and pledged to make sure they were on equal footing. So it\u2019s hard for him to ignore that Alaska Natives are overwhelmingly in support of the project. Within days of her taking office over the summer, Rep. Mary Peltola\u2014the first Alaska Native elected to serve in Congress and a Democrat\u2014urged the Interior Department to approve the project as a way to demonstrate \u201cthe Administration\u2019s commitment to addressing inflation, high energy costs, the need for greater energy security, and environmental justice initiatives.\u201d\n\nUltimately, this is going to be Biden\u2019s call, and his most enviro-minded advisers may have to calibrate their ambitions for scaling back the nation\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels as energy prices remain high and the demand for cheap and easy power is not fading.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign rhetoric won over younger voters and green ones, too. But the trail is one thing, and the art of governing is another one altogether. In that, Biden may have to compromise his own aspirations and accept a new oil drilling regime in a state already threatened mightily by climate change. It is unlikely to be a good look among the green activists, but Biden simply may be out of ways to dodge on this one.\n\nMake sense of what matters in Washington. Sign up for the D.C.

{"text": "On the night of November 3, 2020, news of Carrie Lake's defeat in Arizona's Senate election was just announced, and the result was clear: Lake had lost his opponent Mark Kelly's seat. In the months leading up to the election, Lake has been a favorite among conservative voters in the state, and her loss surprised many. So, why did Lake Carrie really lose her game? In the months leading up to the election, Lake was confident in her chances of winning, citing her anti-tax messages and small government certificates. However, Mark Kelly was a powerful opponent and ran a strong campaign that many believed ultimately contributed to her defeat. \"I am humbled and honored to have won the trust of the people of Arizona. My message that puts the state above the party resonates with the people of Arizona, and I look forward to putting the state back on the right track in a bipartisan way,\" Kelly said in a post-election statement. Kelly's bipartisan cooperation and cross-passage message is certainly one of the reasons that Leck lost, but it wasn't the only factor. Throughout the primary, Lake was known for her hard-line stance on immigration, calling for greater border security, denying safe cities and opposing immigrant driver's licenses. In a state where Latinos make up a large portion of its population, she doesn't agree with many voters about immigrants. In addition, Kelly ran an effective grassroots campaign to reach voters and spread his message using tactics such as knocking on the door and brooming. He also managed to secure financial support from outside state sources, enabling him to spend more money than Leck during his campaign. In addition, Kelly's stance on health care, gun control and the environment resonated with Arizona voters, leading many to believe that he had better plans for the state. On the other hand, Leck is more viewed as ideologically conservative, which has left her without support from moderate and independent voters. Finally, Kelly succeeded in describing the lake as \"the Washington insider\" and \"a swamp creature,\" while he was portrayed as an outsider and a \"champion of change.\" This strategy resonated with many voters, especially those who were looking for someone to shake Washington's status quo. Ultimately, Kelly's bipartisan cooperation, grassroots organizations, state funding and powerful messaging helped him win the game. Despite her best efforts, Lake simply couldn't overcome these factors.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Unfortunately, sometimes we find ourselves in financial trouble and need to borrow money to make a living. When that happens, finding a lender who can lend you the money you need seems daunting, especially if your credit score is poor. Fortunately, there are many lenders willing to offer loans to bad creditors.In this article, we will introduce the best bad credit loans available in 2022. Guaranteed loans A secured loan is a loan backed by some form of collateral, such as a car or house. By providing collateral, lenders can be more secure in believing that the loan will be paid back. Unsecured loans Unsecured loans don't require any collateral, so lenders must ensure that borrowers are trustworthy and they can pay on time. While unsecured loans may have higher interest rates due to the greater risk their lenders bear, they remain ideal options for people with poor credit. Co-op loans 2006-2007 Collaboration loans are one of the best options for bad credit lenders, as they are financed by individuals rather than banks or credit unions. As a result, these lenders may be more willing to lend to bad credit lenders. Loans without credit check Some lenders don't offer credit check loans, these types of loans do not require a credit check and are usually suitable for people with bad credit. They may have higher interest rates because the lender assumes greater risk, but they are still a viable option for people with bad credit. Payday Loans Payday loans are short-term loans that usually have to be repaid within a few weeks. They may have higher interest rates, so it's important to make sure you can pay on time. Emergency Loans Some lenders offer emergency loans that are specifically designed to help those with poor credit during a financial crisis. These loans may have higher interest rates, so it's important to make sure you can afford the payment. Community Credit Unions Community credit unions are a great choice for bad credit people because they are not-for-profit organizations, so they may be more willing to work with bad credit people. They may also offer lower interest rates than other lenders. Personal Loans A personal loan is another option for those with poor credit.A Personal loan is someone who borrows money from you without the involvement of a bank or credit union, this type of loan may come from knowing your family or close friends and can trust you to pay on time. These are the best bad loans for 2022. Before borrowing, it's important to consider all options and make sure you pay on time. With the right loan and a little financial discipline, you can get your finances back on track and make sure you're making wise financial decisions.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Nearly two weeks have passed since Tyler Horner, a University of Idaho student and murder suspect, was arrested for the fatal shooting of 20-year-old John Taylor near campus. Now, newly released police body camera footage shows Horner and his father Christopher Horner discussing the shooting in Washington at a transport station in Indiana. On Wednesday, Indiana police released the video showing a father and son arrested for violating traffic rules on January 11 in White County, Indiana. At that time, authorities had obtained an arrest warrant for Tyler Horner, a 20-year-old student at Moscow University in Idaho. In the video, officers told Horner and his father that there was an arrest warrant. When police began asking about their whereabouts, the two started discussing the shooting in Washington. \"Did he shoot in Washington?\" the police could hear an inquiry from a body camera lens. Christopher Horner later explained that his son was involved in the shooting at a house in Washington state, and he was the one who shot it. \"The story we got is that this man was chasing his daughter and his son, the guy who was with me, shot him,\" he said. Then the officer asked Horner if he was the person who fired the gun. Hearing Horner told police that he was actually the person who shot, although it wasn't intentional. \"It was, like, an accident,\" Horner could hear in the camera. The father went on to explain that he and his son were en route to Idaho because their son was wanted for the murder of Tyler in Moscow. At the time of the traffic stop, authorities had obtained a warrant for Horner's arrest and he was wanted in connection with Taylor's murder on January 6 near Idaho University Park. Taylor, also a student at the school, was found dead in a parking lot with gunshot wounds. The video shows officers explaining to Horner and his father that he was arrested for first-degree murder, then police put Horner in handcuffs and escort him to the back of a patrol car. At the end of the footage, the police officer asked Christopher Horner and his son for directions when they were at the traffic station. Then it was possible to hear Christopher Horner telling officers that they were going to Idaho, but he and his son had not yet decided their exact destination. Horner was later extradited to Idaho, where he faced first-degree murder in connection with Taylor's shooting death. He did not plead guilty and his next trial date has not yet been set. The recently released footage of the transport station's body camera has sparked great public interest and provided a glimpse into the tense moments leading up to Horner's arrest. While it is not clear exactly what led to the shooting in Washington, these shots show an emotional dialogue between father and son discussing the incident. Meanwhile, the University of Idaho subsequently issued a statement on the incident, expressing condolences to Taylor's family and stressing the importance of campus safety and security. \"Our campus is deeply saddened and affected by this incident,\" the school said in a statement, \"We will continue to provide a safe and secure environment for students and the campus community.\" The body-camera footage released Wednesday shows another dimension to the story of Horner's arrest, revealing tensions between father and son as well as pre-arrest emotions. The footage also provides a glimpse into what happened in Washington, DC, and raises more questions about exactly what happened.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Debt has surged over the past year due to inflation running near its highest pace in more than 40 years and amid rising interest rates and strong consumer demand.\n\nThe increase follows a $310 billion jump in the second quarter and represents a $1.27 trillion annual increase.\n\nTotal debt jumped by $351 billion for the July-to-September period, the largest nominal quarterly increase since 2007, bringing the collective household IOU in the U.S. to a fresh record $16.5 trillion. That's an increase of 2.2% from the previous quarter and 8.3% from a year ago.\n\nHouseholds increased debt during the third quarter at the fastest pace in 15 years due to hefty increases in credit card usage and mortgage balances, the Federal Reserve reported Tuesday.\n\nThe biggest contributors to that debt load came from mortgage balances, which rose $1 trillion from a year ago to $11.7 trillion, and credit card debt, which climbed to $930 billion.\n\nThe credit card balance collectively rose more than 15% from the same period in 2021, the largest annual jump in more than 20 years, according to the New York Fed, which released the report. The increase \"towers over the last eighteen years of data,\" a group of Fed researchers said in a blog post on the central bank site.\n\n\"Credit card, mortgage, and auto loan balances continued to increase in the third quarter of 2022 reflecting a combination of robust consumer demand and higher prices,\" said Donghoon Lee, economic research advisor at the New York Fed. \"However, new mortgage originations have slowed to pre-pandemic levels amid rising interest rates.\"\n\nNew York Fed researchers attributed the credit card growth to \"very robust\" consumption, rising prices and consumers using substantial levels of savings that remain on accounts.\n\nAlong with the rise in balances has come an increase in delinquencies.\n\nHowever, while \"delinquency rates are rising, they remain low by historical standards and suggest consumers are managing their finances through the period of increasing prices,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nElsewhere in the report, the Fed said auto loan balances edged higher to $1.52 trillion while student loan debt nudged lower to $1.57 trillion. Student loan debt is the lowest since the second quarter of 2021 amid an extended period of forbearance and the Biden administration's efforts to forgive some education loan debt.\n\nAuto loan debt, while posting only a slight increase on a quarterly basis, is up 5.6% from a year ago.\n\nMortgage balances continued to grind higher amid a sharp increase in interest rates that has seen 30-year mortgages loan rates hover around 7%. Total debt climbed even though originations fell sharply, dropping nearly 17% to $633 billion.\n\nForeclosures remained low even as a pandemic-related moratorium expired. Student loan delinquent rates remained around 4%.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "SVB Securities' Jon Swope thinks some digital-health startups will IPO in the second half of 2023.\n\nSwope said mental-health and women's-health startups will be best positioned to go public.\n\nOther startups will use debt or mergers to buy themselves runway in a downturn, he said.\n\nAfter last year's funding spree, the digital-health market took a tumble in 2022, dragging down the number of healthcare-startup exits.\n\nIn 2021, 15 US-based digital-health companies went public via IPO, according to Rock Health. Only one digital-health company has gone public this year: Akili Interactive Labs, which went public in August in a SPAC deal.\n\nAnd Akili's stock has fallen dramatically from its public-market debut \u2014 when shares surged as high as $37.58 \u2014 to $1.65 as of December 15. Seeing the writing on the wall, digital-health companies like Komodo Health that sought to IPO this year are now putting those plans on hold.\n\nBut SVB Securities' Jon Swope said he thinks the IPO market will reopen for certain digital-health companies in the second half of 2023.\n\nJon Swope, senior managing director in investment banking at SVB Securities. SVB Securities\n\nSwope, the senior managing director of investment banking at SVB Securities and the leader of the firm's digital-health practice, has worked on numerous IPO deals over the years.\n\nHe thinks high-growth healthcare startups that rely on technology, which are either already profitable or have a clear path to profitability, will be first to test the waters.\n\n\"Each day that goes by is another day closer to realizing that your next capital raise, if you need one, has to be your last before becoming a cash-flow positive company,\" he said. \"The days of burning cash with no end in sight, that's over for now.\"\n\nIn particular, Swope said mental-health and women's-health startups, particularly those who serve patients by partnering with employers and health plans, will be in the best position to go public. Those companies have large markets of potential customers and deliver significant value to their patients, to their employers, and to health-plan customers, he said.\n\nDifferent approaches to getting cash\n\nFor the majority of digital-health startups that stay away from the public markets next year, figuring out how to secure capital to ride out the downturn \u2014 without compromising their valuations \u2014 will be critical, Swope said.\n\n\"Those companies that were close to IPO but still burning a lot of cash, their first choice certainly won't be a down-round IPO,\" he said.\n\nThe first choice for healthcare startups, he said, will always be a flat or an up round, where the company lands the same or a greater amount of equity as their previous fundraise. But when startups can't secure a round with those terms, they'll most likely turn to debt.\n\nDebt rounds are considered \"unpriced\" rounds and won't impact the startup's valuation, Swope said. Venture debt also doesn't require founders to give up any of their ownership in a company, unlike an equity fundraise. The catch, of course, is that startups will have to pay those loans back.\n\nSwope said a lot of companies are doing convertible notes, which are a form of short-term debt that typically convert to equity in a future funding round. Seed-stage companies are most likely to issue convertible notes.\n\nA startup's last choice, Swope said, is a down round.\n\nReckoning with inflated valuations\n\nHealthcare startups will try to avoid down rounds at all costs, in part so they don't have to notch a new, potentially reduced valuation, Swope said. Plenty of companies that locked down sky-high valuations in 2020 and 2021 with large funding rounds will face this conundrum.\n\n\"For example, Ro is valued at $7 billion,\" Swope said. \"What's next for companies like that?\"\n\nSwope said he thinks there will be more private companies merging next year, in the style of deals like the October 2021 Headspace-Ginger merger and Thirty Madison's merger with Nurx in February.\n\nBecause there's no outside capital flowing in during those mergers, some startups may attempt those deals to gain stability in a rocky market without having to establish a new valuation, Swope said.\n\n\"Those with cash and cash runway will be in a strong position for negotiating leverage in what will be a more active M&A environment than this past year,\" he said.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Apple has been an important player in the smartphone market for many years, and its iPhone is the most popular choice for mobile phone users. But Apple's iPhone has recently received some criticism because of a common problem when sending messages with photos or videos between iPhones and Android devices. The problem is that when a user sends a photo or video from an iPhone to an Android device, the image looks pixelized and distorted. This has become a major trouble for both iPhone and Android users because it affects the overall quality of their text and makes it difficult to clearly view images or videos. The issue has been around for some time, but it looks like Google is ready to take a stand and raise awareness. On Monday, the tech giant launched a massive billboard ad in California that directly appealed to Apple and urged the company to \"fix pixelized photos and videos in text between iPhones and Android.\" There's an iPhone on the billboard with a serious pixelized photo of a dog and a message in bold words that says, \"Hey Apple, fix pixelized photos and videos in text between your iPhone and Android.\" It's a bold move because Apple isn't known for responding to criticism this way. Google's billboard is a clear attempt to raise awareness of the problem and push Apple to address it. For Google, this is also an aggressive move, because Apple is one of their biggest competitors in the smartphone market. The ad has caused a sensation in the tech industry, and many have speculated about what Apple's response will be. While some believe that the company will actively accept criticism and take action on the issue, others argue that the tech giant will simply ignore the issue and continue to do business as usual. As far as Apple is concerned, it has yet to respond to advertising or criticism. However, many Apple fans and users want the company to take notice of billboards and take action to address this issue. It's not clear how long the billboard will last, but in any case, Google clearly intends to raise awareness about this issue and force Apple to take action. Whether Apple will respond to ads and take steps to solve the problem remains to be seen, but it is certainly an interesting development in the ongoing struggle between the two tech giants.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "In a hayloft overlooking the soy fields, dirt roads, and rustic houses that make up their isolated religious colony, eight women gather for a discussion. The eldest ones lead. The youngest two braid each other\u2019s hair. They talk and talk and talk for hours, trying to reach a decision before the men who hurt them return the next day. Often, the women nitpick one another\u2019s words\u2014why they\u2019re chosen, how they\u2019re used, and what they mean. Is \u201cfleeing\u201d their community the same as \u201cleaving\u201d it? Would forcing themselves to forgive their violators equal true forgiveness?\n\nTo some, this may sound like the kind of verbose material more fit for a stage play than a film. But Women Talking, adapted by the writer-director Sarah Polley from Miriam Toews\u2019s 2018 novel, is vibrant cinema. Polley lends the central conversation a visual gravitas normally reserved for epics: She shot the movie on the widest canvas possible using the same kind of equipment that captured Star Wars landscapes, and applied a muted color grading to every frame. She told me last year that she wanted the ensemble film to look like \u201ca faded postcard,\u201d an artifact suggesting that the women (played by actors including Rooney Mara, Jessie Buckley, and Claire Foy) are already abandoning their circumstances. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to shy away from how tremendous the stakes were for them in having this conversation,\u201d Polley said. \u201cThey\u2019re literally talking about ending a world and creating a new one.\u201d\n\nRead: A #MeToo movie devoid of sensationalism\n\nNot that Polley ever shows how their world ends or what it becomes. Women Talking is inspired by real-life incidents that occurred in a Mennonite community in Bolivia: The colony\u2019s female members were repeatedly drugged and raped in the middle of the night, then made to believe they had dreamed the attacks. Like the novel, the film begins after the perpetrators have been arrested and the remaining men have left to post bail and retrieve them. But Polley resists the impulse to depict the most obviously dramatic scenes. She doesn\u2019t show, for instance, the men who crash the meeting, or the two boys who threaten to expose the women\u2019s plans. Instead, her film focuses squarely on the women\u2019s discussion over whether they should stay and fight, or pack up and leave the only home they\u2019ve ever known. \u201cI was really curious about making a film in which people have their minds changed,\u201d she told me. \u201cEven when they\u2019re at odds with each other, they\u2019re hearing each other enough that their positions can shift and change and get to a place where they\u2019re all going in the same direction.\u201d\n\nDespite its heavy setup, the film moves with an unexpected buoyancy. For these women, the worst has already happened. Imagining a way forward, through compromise and commitment, is the more intense, and perhaps more exciting, task at hand. Each woman harbors different belief systems and ideas. To come to anything close to an agreement, they must pay attention to one another\u2019s thoughts, absorb contrasting opinions in good faith, and allow space for every observation\u2014even the most tangential monologue about one woman\u2019s beloved horses. And so, they argue. They tease. They cry. They console. They sing.\n\nEvery scene, as a result, tracks the discussion\u2019s evolution. Minute shifts in tone and demeanor become monumental. To even embark on this meeting, the movie suggests, is a courageous act. \u201cBlack-and-white is a much easier place to live than the middle of a bunch of really messy questions,\u201d Polley said. But that \u201cis sadly where life resides.\u201d Just as a war movie can encourage its audience to appreciate heroism and sacrifice, Women Talking reminds us of the value of language\u2014its capacity for context, for constructive debate, and, in the end, for collective healing.\n\nIn Toews\u2019s novel, a lone man named August attends the meeting. He\u2019s there to transcribe the session\u2014the women are illiterate, having never been allowed an education\u2014but he also serves as a guide for the reader, interpreting the arguments and providing background information. His thoughts aren\u2019t interruptions but essential analyses of each woman\u2019s take.\n\nAs she worked on the adaptation\u2019s script, Polley assumed August\u2019s task. She rewrote the screenplay more than a dozen times, poring over it from every character\u2019s perspective at least twice to \u201ctitrate each moment so that nobody got lost.\u201d In one pass, for example, she wrote as if the lead character were Ona (played by Mara), the group\u2019s levelheaded peacemaker; in another, she took on the perspective of Mariche (Buckley), the most cynical member. \u201cEven if they\u2019re behaving in ways that are really difficult and obstructionist, I could at least feel it from the inside out of how they were arriving there,\u201d Polley said. \u201cI think it was really important to keep everybody in balance, and that no voice was more important than the other.\u201d\n\nThe Herculean exercise paid off: Women Talking feels energizing to watch, because it\u2019s interested in parsing every opinion rather than exhausted by the characters\u2019 thoroughness. Polley, who\u2019s picky about projects\u2014this is the first film she\u2019s directed in a decade\u2014told me that the chance to immerse herself in each character\u2019s mindset helped draw her to the story. Toews\u2019s novel, she explained, examined a reckoning in an unusual way: It moved beyond the immediate, outrage-fueled aftermath and evaluated every argument\u2019s merits and flaws. That\u2019s the opposite of how today\u2019s discourse tends to pan out, especially on social media, where indecision seems intolerable. \u201cTo be a fence-sitter is treacherous territory,\u201d Polley said of being online.\n\nIn the hayloft, however, that\u2019s not the case. The women\u2019s meeting can be seen as a microcosm of how loud declarations must transform into quieter reflections for the thorniest real-life discussions\u2014such as the ongoing debate over sexual harassment in the workplace\u2014to progress. \u201cAt the beginning of the [#MeToo] movement, there were conversations about, like, \u2018I just want to ship all of these men who have done these things to an island, and I don\u2019t ever hear from them again,\u2019\u201d Polley explained. \u201cUnfortunately, there is no such island, you know? \u2026 I think forgiveness is a very, very complex thing that can be misinterpreted in a thousand ways, [but] I\u2019m really curious about what it looks like to create corridors for people to shift and change and redeem themselves \u2026 Yes, we need to tear things down in the process, but hopefully we\u2019re building as much as we want to tear down.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead without forgetting the lessons learned and asking What do we truly want? rather than merely What can we do?\u2014these are the ideas that animated Polley\u2019s treatment of Women Talking. Months into editing, she cut some of her favorite scenes she\u2019s ever shot and replaced the original narration adapted from the book. Instead of having August (Ben Whishaw) as the guide, Polley wrote a fresh passage from the perspective of the hayloft meeting\u2019s youngest member, who, rather than addressing the audience, speaks directly to Ona\u2019s baby, born after the film\u2019s conclusion. The new voice-over suggests that the women did arrive at a better future; at the same time, it treats their summit as a sacred event that needs to be remembered. In other words, Women Talking casts an eye toward the future even as it portrays the past. In a single conversation, time collapses, and what emerges is hope. What could be more epic than that?", "label": "human"}

Overall, women of color will also break a record for their representation this year, with 58 serving, and within the House alone, there will be a record number of both Latinas and Black women.\n\nThe new Congress also boasts the House\u2019s first Gen-Z lawmaker and the longest-serving woman in congressional history.\n\nSome newcomers, Republicans and Democrats alike, also achieved historic firsts in their own states, ushering a diverse group into a politically split Washington.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the lawmakers, some new and some returning, who are making history in each chamber during this session of Congress.\n\nUS Senate\n\nAlabama: Republican Katie Britt is the first woman elected to the Senate from Alabama, winning an open seat vacated by her onetime boss, GOP Sen. Richard Shelby, who held the seat for nearly four decades.\n\nAlabama\u2019s two previous female senators both were appointed to fill vacancies.\n\nCalifornia: Democrat Alex Padilla will be the first elected Latino senator from California, winning a special election for the remainder of Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 term as well as an election for a full six-year term. Padilla, the son of Mexican immigrant parents, was appointed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom to the seat Harris vacated when she became vice president.\n\nOklahoma: Republican Markwayne Mullin will be the first Native American senator from Oklahoma in almost 100 years, winning the special election to succeed GOP Sen. Jim Inhofe, who is resigning. Mullin, a member of the Cherokee Nation, represented the state\u2019s 2nd Congressional District in the last Congress. Democrat Robert Owen, also a member of the Cherokee Nation, represented Oklahoma in the Senate from 1907 to 1925.\n\nUS House of Representatives\n\nAZ-06: Juan Ciscomani will be the first Latino Republican elected to Congress from Arizona. Ciscomani, who was born in Mexico and immigrated to the US with his family as a child, previously worked at the Tucson Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and was a senior adviser to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey.\n\nCA-42: Democrat Robert Garcia will be the first out LGBTQ immigrant elected to Congress. Garcia, who immigrated from Lima, Peru, in the early 1980s at the age of 5, has been the mayor of Long Beach.\n\nCO-08: Democrat Yadira Caraveo will be the first Latina elected to Congress from Colorado. Caraveo, a state representative and the daughter of Mexican immigrant parents, defeated Republican state Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer to win the seat located north of Denver.\n\nFL-10: Democrat Maxwell Frost will be the first Gen-Z member of Congress after winning the open seat for Florida\u2019s 10th Congressional District.\n\nThe 25-year-old representative-elect told CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow on November 9 that when President Joe Biden called to congratulate him, the president recalled being too young to be sworn in as a senator when he was first elected at age 29.\n\n\u201cHe asked me if it was the same situation. I said, \u2018No, Mr. President, you had me beat on that. I\u2019m already old enough to be sworn in on January 3.\u2019 So, it was great to talk with him. You know, he was elected at a very young age, too, so he understands that experience,\u201d Frost said on \u201cCNN This Morning.\u201d\n\nIL-03: Democrat Delia Ramirez will be the first Latina elected to Congress from Illinois.

{"text": "News of seaweeds destroying the Australia-New Zealand cruise ship has shaken tourism, especially the cruise ship responsible for the trip. More than 400 passengers were reportedly trapped off the coast of Australia after a flowering of toxic algae caused their cruise ship, Pacific Star, to be delayed by several days. The flowering of the algae makes it impossible for the ship to move, as the entire hull is covered with unusual and dangerous green clay. The passengers were trapped at sea for more than 48 hours as the crew tried to clean up the mess and make the boat worth sailing again, during which time they had to face the smell and scale of algae and the fact that they could not get off the ship or stop in the process. The cruise ship \"Star Trek\" eventually issued a statement claiming responsibility for the incident, saying they deeply regret the inconvenience and pain it caused to passengers. They added that they would compensate all passengers, refund their money, offer future discounts, and they \"strive to learn from this incident and make sure it never happens again.\" The event is a wake-up call for the cruise industry, which has become increasingly vulnerable to the flowering of algae as climate change leads to rising ocean temperatures and water becoming more acidic. In the past, the flowering of algae has been a problem in many coastal cities, but the possibility that they affect large ships and impact tourism is a new and worrying development. Experts warn that if preventive measures are not taken, the situation will worsen in the future, potentially making such incidents more frequent. According to the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, the effects of climate change have led to an increase in harmful algae growth in many parts of the world. The Australian government responded quickly to the incident, and a spokesman for the environment minister said they were \"investigating what action can be taken to ensure that such incidents do not happen again.\" The spokesman added that the government wants to ensure that affected passengers receive appropriate compensation, and they are working with cruises to achieve this goal. This is an embarrassing event for cruise ships, and the Australian government hopes to avoid such events in the future. It draws attention to the potential damage that can be caused by the flowering of harmful algae and emphasizes the need for the tourism industry to take more precautions to ensure the safety of its passengers.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "With the arrival of a new year, many investors are still fresh in their minds about 2020's stock market performance. The year was full of strong volatility and uncertainty, but eventually recovered from the lows triggered by the March 2020 pandemic. Unfortunately, Jim Cramer, a senior Wall Street expert, warns that negative forces are still at work and could cause the U.S. economy to fall back in 2021. In a recent interview with CNBC's \"crazy currency,\" Kramer put forward his argument that, despite some recovery in the stock market, basic economic fundamentals remain weak. He noted that unemployment remained high, with millions of workers being laid off or unemployed over the past year. He also pointed out that many fiscal and monetary stimulus measures enacted in 2020 were either temporary or about to expire. \"The Fed has deviated from its previous position of unlimited quantitative easing, which could lose some momentum for stock market gains, at least for a while,\" Kramer said. He also looked at government spending habits, noting that the recent $900 billion relief plan may have only limited positive impact. \"Overall, this seems to be a more difficult year for the U.S. economy,\" said Kramer. \"The recovery will be slow and hard, with some sectors such as hospitality, retail and tourism facing particular difficulties.\" Climer said he believes the overall economic environment will remain weak in 2021 and investors need to be extra cautious. \"I don't want to be overly pessimistic here, but I think investors should prepare for another difficult year,\" he said. \"At the same time, I would like to warn against taking too much risk. People should pay attention to their personal situation, be selective in investing, and look for companies that can overcome economic upheaval in the long run.\" He also advised investors to remain diversified and focus on the fundamentals of each share or market segment. \"Sometimes the best stocks don't always look like that, even if it means giving up some potential returns, be cautious. The market can be unpredictable and some stocks can quickly get overvalued. It's better to conserve and miss out on some gains than take too much risk and lose,\" Kramer said. Overall, Jim Cramer believes that 2021 will bring more challenges to the U.S. economy. But he still wants the recovery to continue as long as investors remain disciplined and remember to take a long-term view of their investments.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": ": Political experts Illinois Senate Should Pass Attack Weapons Ban: Political Experts As the country's fight against gun violence surges and states take action to protect their citizens, there is growing agreement among political experts that Illinois should join a growing list of states banning assault weapons. The recent deadly mass shootings in Colorado and Georgia have sparked a long debate about the need for gun control legislation. Many argue that the United States should expand background checks on buying guns, and tighten rules regarding when and where they can be purchased. But political experts are increasingly agreeing that banning assault weapons is the most effective way to prevent gun violence. \"Attack weapons should be banned, and Illinois should be the number one culprit,\" said Janet Napolitano, a political analyst and former Illinois governor. \"The nationwide shooting statistics involving assault weapons are alarming and the Illinois Legislature should take them seriously. We are at a turning point in our nation's history.\" Statistics show that in 2020, offensive weapons were used to kill more than 10,000 people, of which nearly 3,000 occurred in Illinois. \"It's time for Illinois to join the growing number of states that ban assault weapons,\" said Jennifer Higgins, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago. \"This country needs meaningful and effective gun control legislation to end the epidemic of gun violence and save lives.\" The Illinois Senate is currently considering a bill to prohibit the sale, transfer and possession of offensive weapons in the state. This measure was supported by Democratic and Republican senators, as well as some police chiefs and mayors in major Illinois cities. \"This bill is critical to protecting our communities,\" said Sen. Laura Murphy, who sponsored the bill, \"These weapons have been used in devastating attacks on our citizens and we have a responsibility to make sure they are no longer circulating.\" The proposed bill would also ban high-capacity magazines and require owners of existing offensive weapons to register with the state. \"This is a comprehensive plan to ensure that people have the ability to own guns responsibly, while protecting the public from the threat of these weapons,\" said Senator Don Harmon, one of the bill's co-sponsors. The bill has strong support from gun control advocates, who see it as an important step in the fight against gun violence. Amanda Rodriguez, representative of the Coalition to End Gun Violence in Illinois, said: \"We've seen too many unnecessary deaths caused by the use of offensive weapons and we have to act to prevent more incidents.\" We urge the Senate to pass this bill and join a growing number of states in taking this important step. As some states across the country have already implemented similar bans, the Illinois Senate is under pressure to follow suit. \"This is a necessary step for Illinois to take,\" Napolitano said, adding: \"It's time for the Senate to act.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".. Dubai has removed a 30 percent consumption tax on alcohol sales, the latest in a series of measures taken by the city's state to spur an economic rebound after the coronavirus pandemic. The tax, introduced in 2019, was initially welcomed by the city's residents as a way to balance public health concerns and expanding tourism. But with the virus pandemic shutting down nonessential businesses, the government has been working to restore Dubai's status as a commercial and leisure destination. The government said in a statement on Sunday that it had removed 30 percent of the tax because \"the current pandemic requires economic stimulus to promote an economic recovery and strengthen the competitiveness of the emirate.\" Excise taxes on the sale of alcohol, tobacco, energy drinks and other items have been a major source of revenue for the government. But Dubai hopes that this change will help boost the economy by encouraging tourists and locals to increase spending. Dubai's economy shrank by 8.9% in 2020, the worst contract since it began a record run in 1975, with tourism among them. But the government believes its aggressive strategy of tax cuts, increased subsidies and economic assistance to businesses and families will help stimulate growth. The elimination of the excise tax, which will take effect from this month, is expected to have a positive impact on the economy. Following other measures, such as reducing the value-added tax (VAT) from 5% to 0% in 2020 and introducing the Covid-19 vaccine in the city, there are several factors that can be seen in the reduction of the VAT rate: an increase in the number of people who need it for more than half of their lives; increases in the percentage of those who do not receive it due to higher levels of health care; decreases in the amount of time they spend at least one year or more working hours during the first five months of the previous two years; changes in the level of employment between men and women with regard to access to education through training programmes; improvements in the quality of education provided by law enforcement agencies; increased availability of educational facilities within the framework of these programs; improved use of public services offered by local government institutions; improvement of social security standards; promotion of human rights awareness among all sectors of society; implementation of national policies aimed at protecting children against HIV/AIDS; development of new forms of anti-retroviral drugs; prevention of drug abuse; eradication of illicit drugs; provision of adequate medical treatment; introduction of preventive medicine into schools; establishment of special clinics where appropriate; rehabilitation of persons deprived of their liberty; maintenance of safe havens; protection of victims &apos; freedoms; recourse to medicines; providing them with information about how to respond to threats arising out of food shortages caused by high rates of ill-fated diseases associated with alcohol consumption; increasing the risk of infection resulting from unhealthy diets; eliminating consumer taxes, which would come into force starting this month, was expected to have a positive impact on the economy. Other measures were taken, such as lowering the Value Added Tax (VAT) from 5% to 0% in 2020, and launching the Covid-19 vaccine in the city. Analysts say the elimination of excise taxes is a step in the right direction, helping to stimulate domestic consumption and strengthen the hospitality sector, which is the cornerstone of Dubai's economy. The government hopes to further improve the business environment by reducing corporate income tax from 15% to 12%. The city is preparing to host the World's Fair later this year, which is expected to attract thousands of visitors from around the world. The Minister of Economy, His Excellency Sultan bin Saeed Almansoori, said that the abolition of taxes and other initiatives are part of the government's efforts to \"revitalize the economic activities affected by the outbreak\". \"We believe these measures will strengthen the emirate's position and contribute to the development of a diversified, highly competitive and resilient economy,\" Al Mansoori added. Dubai is the latest in a list of countries that have cut or eliminated consumption taxes on alcohol and other consumer goods to stimulate economic growth. Qatar and Egypt have also taken steps, such as reducing tariffs and other taxes. But the decision to scrap the excise tax has been criticized by some, who argue that it could lead to increased drinking in a city already struggling to balance public health and economic development. Critics also argue that drinking is not in line with Islamic values and should be discouraged rather than promoted. But the government has defended the move, saying it will help create jobs, boost consumer spending and attract more tourists to the city. The Dubai government hopes that the elimination of consumption taxes, along with other initiatives such as infrastructure investment and business incentives, will help the city recover from the economic impact of the coronavirus and become a leading global business and leisure center.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "After a majority of Republican lawmakers cast their votes in favor of current Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, he appears to be the clear winner. However, McCarthy unexpectedly lost that vote, with only 203 out of 435 members supporting him. McCarthy's defeat means the House must now move to a new round of voting. His closest rival, Georgia Republican Representative Liz Cheney, is the only other candidate for the position and will likely have plenty of opportunities in coming rounds. It also marks a setback for the Republican Party, which has been expecting him to be their candidate in November's midterm elections. As majority leader, McCarthy has been a powerful figure in the House for years, with broad support from both Democrats and Republicans. Despite McCarthy's sympathy for the Republican Party's tough stance on issues such as immigration and the budget, many of the more conservative members of the House felt that he had deviated from their core beliefs. Their opposition - and a large number of abstentions - was enough to push McCarthy below the majority threshold. The election of the new Speaker of the House of Representatives is an important event, because this role plays a vital role in both domestic and foreign policy debates. It is seen as part of the key checks and balances system operated by the U.S. federal government. The result could have a lasting effect on the Republican Party, as it seeks to maintain control of the House in the upcoming November elections. The Republican Party has faced some internal divisions in recent years, and the lack of a strong top leader could lead to further splits. The current situation in the House of Representatives is a reminder of the turmoil in American politics. It shows that within hours, an avant-garde can become a discarded person, and the future is unpredictable.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, Russian President Vladimir Putin and French and German leaders held talks by phone on Wednesday aimed at easing the conflict in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region. The five-hour phone call came after a dramatic attack on Donetsk and other parts of the conflict zone over several weeks, leading to a surge in violence in the region that has remained relatively peaceful for nearly three years. At the end of the conference call, the Russian, German and French presidents agreed to a seven-day ceasefire agreement starting Jan. 11 that would be respected by all parties to the conflict. Putin described it as a \"humanitarian moratorium\" and said there was a need to allow any potential casualties and any other affected citizens to withdraw from the conflict. However, the proposal was immediately dismissed by Ukraine, which accused Putin of \"falsity\" and claimed that the ceasefire was nothing more than an attempt to improve Russia's image on the world stage. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said in a statement: \"We do not want to be deceived, the President of Ukraine will not be deceived. We understand the Russian Federation's hypocrisy, the purpose of this statement, the goal pursued by our enemies.\" Ukraine was particularly sceptical about the proposed ceasefire, noting that it coincided with the Russian Orthodox Christmas (i.e. on January 7), a proposal which had led to allegations of political ingenuity by Ukrainian officials who viewed the timing of the proposal as deliberately designed to create a peaceful face. However, Putin insists that the cease-fire is intended to provide an opportunity for negotiations and peace, rather than just trying to improve Russia's international image. \"We have no plans to deceive anyone, prevent anyone from doing anything or buying time,\" Putin said in a statement after the phone call. The two sides agreed to \"continue intensive negotiations on all issues, including security, conflict situations and the humanitarian aspects of crisis resolution\". The proposed ceasefire has been welcomed by international powers, including the United States and the United Nations, but it remains to be seen whether either side will abide by the proposed agreement. If the ceasefire continues, it will mark an important step in resolving the conflict that has been raging since 2014, killing more than 13,000 people. Despite the support of international powers, Putin has taken steps to protect Russia's interests in Ukraine by deploying more Russian troops into the region to counter a potential Ukrainian offensive. Russia also has a vested interest in the region, having annexed Crimea in 2014, sparking international protests and leading to a series of Western sanctions. For now, the proposed ceasefire is the only hope for peace in the region, but its success will depend on actions by both sides in the coming days. Therefore, Ukraine and Russia agreed to hold face-to-face talks to discuss the terms of the ceasefire and the overall future of the conflict.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The world of Fintech may have been high in recent years, but a record sell-off in 2022 has marginalized the sector. After experiencing a brief boom across the industry, investors are becoming more cautious about new technologies as the stock market shifts rapidly. The market crash of 2022 is a reminder that despite the very attractive opportunities offered by FinTech, there are still significant risks. After all, a company that seems to have all the necessary infrastructure can quickly and easily lose its foothold. For those looking to make money in the fintech sector, the consequences of a market crash are a clear reminder of the importance of thorough research, precise timing and prudent approaches. While some companies have made progress, most have become more cautious about their investments and use of new technologies. However, the 2022 market sell-off and its impact on tech stocks have made investors increasingly wary of investing in AI-related projects. While artificial intelligence and machine learning can deliver impressive results, there is clearly a risk that investors will end up overtrusting these technologies without understanding their full implications. Similarly, the robotics industry has been a field of innovation for fintech in recent years, but the crash of 2022 has left investors thinking twice about investing in this sector. Robotics has always been an expensive area of technological exploration, and the sudden drop in the stock market has made potential investors more aware of the potential risks and rewards associated with robots. In addition to artificial intelligence and robotics, blockchain technology has been another investment focus for fintech companies. However, the volatility of cryptocurrency prices has led investors to take a more conservative approach to investing in this technology. Overall, the market crash of 2022 has led to sudden changes in how FinTech companies operate and how investors engage with them. While the promise of new technologies remains attractive, the risks associated with them have increased significantly, and Fintech has taken a more cautious approach to its investments and the technology it uses. This more cautious approach has led some companies to rethink their strategies, focus more on mitigating risk and ensuring investment in more reliable technologies. Others continue to pursue ambitious projects, but do so with greater attention to detail and a greater consideration of potential risks. Overall, the 2022 market crash appears to be a valuable learning experience for financial technology companies, and many have learned from it. As the industry moves forward, it will be interesting to see how this new discovery of caution is reflected in the way that financial technology companies invest and use new technologies.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "PARIS (Reuters) - French grain, feed and wine group InVivo announced the acquisition of one of Belgium's oldest malt houses in the world, marking a new chapter in the company's development. InVivo said on Tuesday it would acquire Moeskroen Malting, based in Moeskroen Malting, Belgium, whose roots date back to the 18th century. The acquisition is expected to be completed by the end of January and will provide InVivo with its first malthouse in Europe, which will operate as a separate subsidiary. Moeskroen Malting is Belgium's second largest producer of malt with an annual output of 25,000 tons and is a major potato exporter in the UK and other EU countries. The acquisition is part of InVivo's strategy to expand its presence in Europe and become a major malt producer in the brewing and distilling industry. Headquartered in Angus, Loire Valley, InVivo is a major supplier of French grains, feed and wine, as well as two breweries, one in the Cognac region and the other in the Burgundy region. Moeskroen Malting has been operating since the late 18th century and has long supplied malt to wineries and distilleries in Belgium, France and England. The acquisition of Moeskroen Malting is part of InVivo's strategy to become a major player in the malt market after InVivo acquired Les Grande Malteries Lyonnaises, another French malthouse, in 2016. InVivo has also been investing in malt research and the modernization of production processes. InVivo CEO and Chairman Pierre-Emmanuel Petit said the acquisition of Moeskroen Malting was an important step for the company. \"This transaction is in line with our commitment to develop our agricultural business in Europe, especially for malt and beer production. This will give InVivo a strong foothold in the Belgian potato market and allow us to strengthen our presence in the French and British markets,\" Petit said in a statement. He added that the acquisition will strengthen the company's expertise in malt production and its access to new markets. The acquisition comes after InVivo announced last week a partnership agreement with French winemaker Fischer and a strategic partnership with German beer group Carlsberg. InVivo also said that the acquisition, which will be financed through a combination of debt and equity, is expected to be completed by the end of January. InVivo's latest move is an important step for the French group and should further strengthen its position in the European malt production market. It also demonstrates InVivo's investment commitment to the food and beverage industry, which is a key growth area of the company.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Security researchers say the hackers have leaked more than 200 million account-related Twitter usernames and email addresses. Two researchers at cybersecurity firm Safe Detectives disclosed the vulnerability in a recent blog post. The two researchers, Sanyam Jain and Or Kawir, wrote that they had access to a large database of Twitter usernames, emails, and protective tweets associated with about 200 million accounts. The researchers said they accidentally found the data while investigating a French-registered website called Otouch.fr, which was shut down after the researchers contacted Twitter to allow anyone to search for Twitter profiles by name, email address or phone number. The researchers said the data was likely collected from a Twitter bug called an \"information breach\" that was fixed in June 2019, which allows hackers to collect data and leak information for all Twitter users. Hackers may obtain data by creating fake applications or websites that look like legitimate ones and then using the vulnerability to collect data from users who allow them access to their accounts. The researchers said the data could allow hackers to attack Twitter accounts, including those with high-profile owners, and access sensitive information such as private messages, direct messages, and payment information. Twitter, for its part, said it had issued a warning about the researchers' data breach and had taken action to fix the vulnerability. The company also urged users to change their passwords when using the same password across multiple services. \"We are grateful to the researchers for bringing this issue to our attention and, out of caution, we encourage people to change their passwords on all potentially reusable services. If users use the same password in Twitter and other services, they should be extra careful, update their passwords and take good account security measures,\" a tweet spokesperson said in a statement. In 2017, hackers used the vulnerability to access hundreds of millions of accounts, including those of prominent users such as Ellen DeGeneres and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. In 2018, hackers stole passwords from tens of millions of users that could be sold online. A few days after Twitter announced it was shutting down its Vine video sharing platform, the platform has been used by more than 200 million users to share short videos. Security researchers say the breach is a reminder that even the most secure apps should be alert to data they share and websites they visit. They also warn that while Twitter has quickly resolved the data breach in this case, users should remain vigilant against cyber-phishing scams and other malicious actors who may try to exploit such information. \"This is another reminder of how important it is to understand the data you share online and the apps you grant access to,\" Jain and Kawir said in their blog post. \"Always be careful about the links you click on, the information you share, and the sources you trust.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "North Korea fired a suspected intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on Tuesday, November 17, the second test this month that shocked the world. The intercontinental ballistic missile was reportedly launched from North-West Korea and flew about 800 kilometers before landing near the coast of Japan. This is the second test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile this month, and the first in nearly two years. President Moon Jae-in of South Korea condemned the test, calling it a \"serious challenge\" to regional security. U.S. President Donald Trump issued a statement saying that the United States would \"take care of it,\" with \"all options on the table.\" North Korea has banned the launch of intercontinental ballistic missiles since 2006, when the United Nations Security Council imposed sanctions on it. Nevertheless, North Korea continues to pursue its nuclear and missile programs. This latest test shows that the country is willing to violate international agreements and continue to advance its weapons program despite the threat of sanctions. The U.N. Security Council is expected to meet to discuss the launch and possibly impose more sanctions on North Korea. China, its biggest ally, has also condemned the test and urged the country to halt its nuclear and missile programs. The launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile is particularly worrying because it shows that North Korea is continuing to develop its weapons capabilities. If the missile is launched at a different angle, it may be able to reach the U.S. mainland. The Trump administration has so far failed to impose meaningful sanctions on North Korea, and it has failed to come up with a plan to prevent the country from pursuing its weapons program. The administration has also been criticized for responding to the nuclear crisis, which critics see as failing to contain North Korea's \"maximum pressure\" strategy. In response to the launch, the United States and South Korea held joint military exercises in the Sea of Japan. The United States also sent two strategic bombers to the region as a show of strength. The flights of these bombers, along with additional sanctions, are aimed at forcing North Korea to stop its nuclear and missile programs. The United States and its allies must work together to find a way to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear and missile programs. Until then, tensions between the United States and North Korea may remain high, and the threat of further intercontinental ballistic missile tests is imminent.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "\"We are all mortals,\" the words of Mike Tomlin, Pittsburgh Steelers head coach, briefly summed up the whole NFL's emotions as news of Damal Hamlin's tragic death ringed across the football world. Hamlin, a 21-year-old security officer at the University of Pittsburgh, died unexpectedly Sunday in a hospital in Pittsburgh. The news first broke on Monday night, sparking shock waves across the NFL and prompting many to reflect on the value of life and the relationship between teammates. Players, coaches, front desk staff and fans all offered their condolences to the Hamlin family as well as ideas and prayers. Several players, including Antonio Brown, Ryan Shazier and Le'Veon Bell, have paid tribute to the young man on social media and shared their grief. The Steelers organization has also gone further in commemorating Hamlin. In order to remain silent for the next home game, the group will pay tribute to wearing special patches on their shirts. Support for Hamlin and his family is a testimony to the NFL's human side and the bonds between teammates, which are often overlooked or taken for granted. The tragic death of Hamlin brought a face to the game and brought it back to the core that made the NFL great: the players. The reality is that players, coaches and even front desk staff have a common bond and connection, and when tragedy strikes they come together in ways that nothing else can do. They are all mortals after all. Hamlin's death stripped off the appearance of the NFL and revealed the human aspects of the sport, which are often lacking in routine day-to-day refinements. As the story unfolds, it's important to remember Damar Hamlin's life and his impact on those around him. The NFL community quickly paid tribute to Hamlin in a supportive gesture, reminding players, coaches and front desk staff that they are also human. Whatever happens on the pitch, the bond that has been established between teammates and the NFL Brotherhood should not be underestimated or taken for granted. Damar Hamlin's death reminds us of this.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Windows 11, the latest iteration of Microsoft's long-running operating system, is here\u2014at least for those with supported PCs. If you take the leap, you'll notice a slick redesign, with a Chrome OS-like centered taskbar and rounded corners on apps. Under the hood, it's largely the same OS, but there are some new features you should know how to use. These tips will help ease the transition from Windows 10 to Windows 11.\n\nRealign the Start Button\n\nThe first thing that will jump out at you is the placement of the Start button. Long located in the lower-left corner of the screen, it's now centered with the rest of the icons on the taskbar. But don't worry, you can change it back. Right-click the taskbar and open Taskbar Settings. Select the Taskbar behaviors drop-down and change Taskbar alignment to Left. This will move all your taskbar icons to the left and put the Start button back where it belongs. For more on personalizing the Windows 11 taskbar, check out our guide.\n\nA Simplified Right-Click Menu\n\nThe right-click menu now focuses only on the most important settings. Should you need more settings\u2014print, set a new background, or view the full file location, for instance\u2014select Show more options to open a spill-over menu.\n\nCustomize the Quicks Setting Panel\n\nWindows 11 separates the Quick Settings that appear in the Action Center in Windows 10 from that panel's notifications. Click the area of the taskbar that has Wi-Fi, speaker, and, battery icons to open a settings menu that lets you control Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, airplane mode, battery saver mode, and more. To add or remove settings buttons here, click the pencil-shaped Edit quick settings button. Unpin what you don't want or click Add to make new features accessible from the Quick Settings menu.\n\nEasier Desktop Management\n\nMicrosoft replaces the old Task View button with a redesigned icon on the taskbar, which makes it easier to create and manage multiple desktops. Just hover over the icon to see any open virtual desktops or create a new desktop. These desktops can then be rearranged as needed, and apps that are in one desktop can be dragged into another.\n\nGather Your Widgets\n\nWhile Windows 10 dabbled in widgets, Windows 11 goes all in. If you want to check the weather, look up sports scores, track stock prices, watch nearby traffic, manage your Outlook calendar, cross tasks off your to-do list, or read the latest news, a new Widgets icon on the taskbar has you covered. You can customize the widgets to suit your needs, rearrange them on the page, and manage your newsfeed preferences through Microsoft News.\n\nMore Multitask Layouts\n\nMicrosoft has supported the snap and resize feature since Windows 7, but it gets a boost in Windows 11 with Snap Layouts. You can still drag and drop windows into place, but in Windows 11, you can also hover over the Maximize button on supported apps to see a menu of layout options\u2014one large window on the left and two on top of each other on the right, or three in a row, for example. Click to select your preferred formation and then move your apps into place.\n\nChat With Teams\n\nMicrosoft Teams\u2014the company's free messaging, calling, and videoconferencing app\u2014is built into Windows 11. Launch video calls and start chats from a new Chat icon on the taskbar; no need to open the Microsoft Teams app. You can sync your contacts through the Teams mobile app, but if your contacts don't use Teams, send invites via email or text. You can also have SMS conversations with contacts even if they don't sign up for Teams, and they can join a video chat from a web link.\n\nGet Things Done With Focus Sessions\n\nWith messages and video chats popping up throughout the work day, it's easy to get distracted as the work piles up. Focus Sessions in Windows 11 encourages you to set aside time for work that requires uninterrupted, deep focus. It's currently available in the new Alarms & Clock app, and offers a quick way to get at least 30 minutes of distraction-free work time. If you go beyond 45 minutes, the app automatically schedules a five-minute break about midway through your session. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide on setting it up for your PC.\n\nStreamlined File Explorer Menu\n\nWith Windows 11, Microsoft streamlines the ribbon at the top of the File Explorer menu. Now only cut, copy, share, sort, and view options are visible; no need to wade through multiple tabs and settings you'll never use. Windows 11 also adds a New button for creating new folders and shortcuts, as well as documents based on the programs you have installed.\n\nPair Input/Output Devices\n\nWindows 11 gets a full-featured Sound menu with the ability to pair new input and output devices. Open Settings > System > Sound and click Add device under the Output section to link external speakers or other devices. Or click Add device under Input to connect an external microphone. You will then be given the choice to connect via Bluetooth, wireless docks, and more. Scroll down to the Advanced section and click All sound devices to view a full list of all input and output devices that have been connected to your PC.\n\nNew Sound Modes\n\nYou get extra control over your audio output in Windows 11, including mono audio and enhanced audio modes. To go mono, open Settings > System > Sound, then enable Mono audio to combine the left and right audio channels. For enhanced audio\u2014which includes bass boost, virtual surround, room correction, and loudness equalization\u2014click All sound devices under the Advanced section of the Sound menu, choose a device to access the Properties menu, and enable Enhance audio.\n\nView the App List\n\nWindows 11 adds an extra step to view your full list of installed apps. Instead of opening the Start menu and immediately seeing the App List next to your live tiles, you have to click the All Apps button in the Pinned section of the Start menu. You will then be able to browse the list or search for a specific app.\n\nPins Apps to the Start Menu\n\nSpeaking of live tiles, they're finally gone in Windows 11. In their place is a more simplistic Start menu where you can pin apps for easy access. Open the App List, right-click on an app, and select Pin to Start to move it to the Pinned section. You can then drag the app into your preferred position. To remove apps, right-click and choose Unpin from Start.\n\nCustomize the Start Menu\n\nIn Windows 10, the Settings button appears above the Start button when you tap it. Not so in Windows 11, but you can add it back(Opens in a new window) via Settings > Personalization > Start > Folders. Here, you can also add File Explorer, other common folders, and Network icons.\n\nGet Better Recommendations\n\nThe new Start menu has a Recommended section for recent files and frequently used apps. To customize what appears here, open Settings > Personalization > Start so you can tell Windows to stop showing recently installed apps, frequently used apps, or recently opened items in the Start menu, App List, and elsewhere.\n\nChange Default Apps\n\nIn Windows 10, it\u2019s easy to choose a default app, but with Windows 11, the process is more complicated, as you need to specify a default app for every file type. Open the Settings app and tap on the Apps section in the left-hand menu. Choose Default apps, click on the app you want to set as the default for a file type, and you\u2019ll see a list of all file types it\u2019s capable of handling. Click on the file type you want, and select an app from the menu that pops up. For a full rundown of the process, check out our guide.\n\nChoose Your Theme\n\nThemes make a return in Windows 11, but this time they work hand-in-hand with dark mode. Open Settings > Personalization and select one of the default themes to change the background image, sounds, cursor, accent color, and color theme all at once. Open Themes to edit current themes, add new themes from the Microsoft Store, or create your own.\n\nBetter Battery Visualization\n\nWindows 11 does a better job than its predecessor of helping you visualize your battery usage data. Go to Settings > System > Power & battery, then open the Battery usage tab. Here you will find a chart that shows how much power you have used over the last few days or hours. A list of apps below that show power usage by individual app. If you find a program that may be using too much power, you can shut down background usage and put it to sleep, just like iPhones and Android devices allow you to do.\n\nGet Used to the New Touch Gestures\n\n(Microsoft)\n\nIf you\u2019re using a touch-screen PC convertible or tablet, like the stunning new Surface Pro 8, you have to get used to a whole new set of touch gestures, many of which involve using multiple fingers. Swiping in from the left side no longer opens task switching mode, but rather the Widgets panel of news and information. To show the Task View, you now have to swipe up on the screen (anywhere) with four fingers. Swiping in from the right still thankfully opens notifications. Swiping down from the top no longer closes an app, but you can swipe down in an app window with three fingers to minimize an app and show the desktop. Swiping three fingers up opens all running windows.\n\nRun Android Apps (in Beta)\n\nIf you're a Windows Insider, you have early access to Android apps in the Microsoft Store. It's currently limited to 50 Amazon Appstore apps, but more are on their way. Here's how to download the Windows Subsystem for Android, install the Appstore, and play around with Android apps on your Windows 11 PC.\n\nMichael Muchmore contributed to this story.\n\nMicrosoft Windows 11 Preview Microsoft Windows 11 Preview", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Category: Late popes Pope Francis led the emotional funeral of his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, as supporters of the late pope sought his quick path to holiness and praised him as one of the most influential Roman Catholic leaders in modern times. Benedict's body, which died last week at the age of 92, was driven by a Swiss guard escort to Rome's rainwatered streets for the Vatican Cathedral, where it was placed in front of the main altar with solemn bells ringing. Francis and 13 cardinals, along with the Swiss Guard accompanying the body as well as dozens of bishops, priests and members of religious groups dressed in white clothes, entered the church and prayed silently for more than a minute before singing a psalm. After the second silent prayer, Francis praised Benedict's humility and grace in his tribute, as well as his commitment to the church. \"We thank God for the Pope Benedict XVI,\" he said, noting many of his predecessor's achievements and calling him a \"bold witness to the gospel.\" The funeral mass marks the first time two popes, past and present, have joined such a solemn setting since the last two popes, John Paul II and Benedict, celebrated service together in October 2012. Thousands of people gathered on the streets of Rome to pay their last respects to the German-born Pope, who resigned after eight years in office in 2013. Father Federico Lombard, the Vatican's official spokesman, said it was an \"emotionally stressful day\" for many attendees, including Pope Francis. \"The atmosphere was deeply respectful and affectionate, and his apparent emotions were very touching,\" Lombardi said. The missionaries carrying the remains of the Benedictine Church were driven to St. Peter's Basilica after a march in Santa Anastasios, Vatican. Members of the Swiss Guard, in their colorful historical dress uniforms, were accompanied by embroidery from the beginning, followed by Cardinals. Supporters of the late pope have already begun the process of making him a saint shortly after his death on April 2. The Vatican said that the body of Benedictine would rest in a crack in the tomb of St. Peter's Cathedral. After the funeral Mass, Pope Francis placed Benedict's pallium on top of his body, a special office coat, and then said one final farewell and blessing. From his humble beginnings in Bavaria to the highest office of the Church, Benedict's life has been marked by a unique and historic relationship with Francis. Both Popes are regarded as best friends and collaborators. In the eyes of believers, Benedict will be seen as a stable, reassuring presence when the church faces many problems. He was a staunch traditionalist who controlled the progressiveism of his predecessor John Paul II, but who, in his last years as Pope, showed a more open attitude to the complex issues facing the church today. Benedict's supporters say it was his efforts to save the Catholic Church from potential secession and his willingness to reach out to other Christian denominations that opened the door to unprecedented dialogue and understanding. Those who saw Benedict in his last years said they were shocked by his modesty and deep humility in the face of serious illness. The funeral of the Benedictine Church also marks the first time in nearly a century that an ex-Pope has rested at St Peter's Cathedral. The Vatican has said that Benedict XVI was buried in the same place reserved for his predecessor John Paul II, but eventually decided to bury him in another place, just a few steps away from John Paul's grave, to show that the two popes are united between life and death. The brief reign of Pope Benedict XVI changed the Church and the world in many ways. He firmly defended traditional values and tried to restore the church's moral authority. But his greatest legacy may be his role in promoting Christian unity, and his efforts to reach out to other churches and faith traditions. The Catholic Church has long believed that in order to be a saint, one must show heroic virtues and live an exemplary life of faith and devotion. When his funeral is over, Pope Francis and the faithful will have Benedict in their hearts and pray as they continue to seek His way into holiness.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "By Pavel Polityuk\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (Reuters) -Russia acknowledged on Monday that scores of its troops were killed in one of the Ukraine war's deadliest strikes, drawing demands from nationalist bloggers for commanders to be punished for housing soldiers alongside an ammunition dump.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said 63 soldiers had died in the fiery blast which destroyed a temporary barracks in a former vocational college in Makiivka, twin city of the Russian-occupied regional capital of Donetsk.\n\nIt said the accommodation had been hit by four rockets fired from U.S.-made HIMARS launchers, claiming two rockets had been shot down. Kyiv said the Russian death toll was in the hundreds, though pro-Russian officials called this an exaggeration.\n\nRussian military bloggers, many with hundreds of thousands of followers, said the huge destruction was a result of storing ammunition in the same building as a barracks, despite commanders knowing it was within range of Ukrainian rockets.\n\nSeparately, Ukraine said on Monday it had shot down all 39 drones Russia had launched in an unprecedented third straight night of air strikes against civilian targets in Kyiv and other cities.\n\nUkrainian officials said their success proved that Russia's tactic in recent months of raining down air strikes to knock out Ukraine's energy infrastructure was increasingly a failure as Kyiv beefs up its air defences.\n\n'EACH MISTAKE HAS A NAME'\n\nUnverified footage posted online of the aftermath of the Makiivka strike on the Russian barracks showed a huge building reduced to smoking rubble.\n\nIgor Girkin, a former commander of pro-Russian troops in east Ukraine who has emerged as one of the highest profile Russian nationalist military bloggers, said the death toll was in the hundreds, later editing his post to include wounded in that figure. Ammunition had been stored at the site and Russian military equipment there was uncamouflaged, he said.\n\nAnother nationalist blogger, Rybar, said around 70 soldiers were confirmed dead and more than 100 wounded.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"What happened in Makiivka is horrible,\" wrote Archangel Spetznaz Z, another Russian military blogger with more than 700,000 followers on Telegram.\n\n\"Who came up with the idea to place personnel in large numbers in one building, where even a fool understands that even if they hit with artillery, there will be many wounded or dead?\" he wrote. Commanders \"couldn't care less\" about ammunition stored in disarray on the battlefield, he said.\n\n\"Each mistake has a name.\"\n\nRussia's acknowledgement of scores of deaths in one incident was almost without precedent. Moscow rarely releases figures for its casualties, and when it does the figures are typically low - it acknowledged just one death from among a crew of hundreds when Ukraine sank its flagship cruiser Moskva in April.\n\nRussia has seen in the new year with nightly attacks on Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv, hundreds of kilometres from the front lines. The nightly attacks mark a change in tactics, after months in which Moscow usually spaced such strikes around a week apart.\n\nAfter firing dozens of missiles on Dec. 31, Russia launched dozens of Iranian-made Shahed drones on Jan. 1 and Jan. 2. But Kyiv said on Monday it had shot down all 39 drones in the latest wave, including 22 shot down over the capital.\n\nKyiv said the new tactic was a sign of Russia's desperation as Ukraine's ability to defend its air space had improved.\n\n\"Now they are looking for routes and attempts to hit us somehow, but their terror tactics will not work. Our sky will turn into a shield,\" presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak said on Telegram.\n\nIn his latest nightly speech, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy praised Ukrainians for showing gratitude to the troops and one another and said Russia's efforts would prove useless.\n\n\"Drones, missiles, everything else will not help them,\" he said of the Russians. \"Because we stand united. They are united only by fear.\"\n\nUkraine's air defence systems worked through the night to bring down incoming drones and to warn communities of the approaching danger.\n\n\"It is loud in the region and in the capital: night drone attacks,\" Kyiv Governor Oleksiy Kuleba said.\n\nRussia has turned to mass air strikes against Ukrainian cities since suffering humiliating defeats on the battlefield in the second half of 2022.\n\nIt says its attacks, which have knocked out heat and power to millions in winter, aim to reduce Kyiv's ability to fight. Ukraine says the attacks have no military purpose and are intended to hurt civilians, a war crime.\n\nRussia has flattened Ukrainian cities, killed thousands of civilians and annexed swathes of Ukraine since Putin ordered his invasion in February, calling Ukraine an artificial state whose pro-Western outlook threatened Russia's security.\n\nUkraine has fought back with Western military support, driving Russian forces from more than half the territory they seized. In recent weeks, the front lines have been largely static, with thousands of soldiers dying in intense warfare.\n\nIn a stern New Year's Eve message filmed in front of a group of people dressed in military uniform, Putin vowed no let-up in his war.\n\n\"The main thing is the fate of Russia,\" Putin said. \"Defence of the fatherland is our sacred duty to our ancestors and descendants. Moral, historical righteousness is on our side.\"\n\n(Reporting by Reuters bureaux; Writing by Peter Graff, Lidia Kelly, Dan Peleschuk and Michael Perry; Editing by Clarence Fernandez, Robert Birsel, Alexandra Hudson)", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Amazon's founder and CEO Jeff Bezos has publicly criticized the concept of work-life balance. Bezos believes that this phrase has a \"weakening\" effect on how individuals handle their professional and personal lives. Bezos, currently the world's richest man with a net worth of more than $200 billion, spoke in an interview with The Wall Street Journal about his views on modern society and the direction Amazon is taking as it moves further into the digital age. In the interview, Bezos explained that he did not like the word \"work-life balance\", because it means work and life should be separate and separated. Bezos went on to say that this term can be \"weak\" in how people think about their lives, which encourages them to make a dual decision between professional and personal life. Bezos explains that in today's world, there is no life without work. \"You have to have both of these things at the same time, you have to live a rich life - enjoy yourself, have fun - and then you also have to work hard. And this balance is actually very important,\" he said. \"It's a circle, not a balance. Bezos' wisdom comes from experience. As the founder and CEO of a company that currently employs hundreds of thousands of people, Bezos knows more than anyone about the importance of a healthy work-life balance. In 2015, there were reports that Amazon's so-called \"wounded\" workplace culture made employees feel overwhelmed and overworked. To address this problem, Bezos implemented measures to reduce the intensity and stress of work at Amazon, including shorter working hours and the introduction of health benefits. Bezos' comments in the interview demonstrate his commitment to creating a better work-life balance for all Amazon employees. He believes that balancing work and life is critical to ensuring the best results for both. Although Bezos focuses on improving the work-life balance of Amazon, he recognizes that work and life are intertwined, and both need to be taken seriously and moderately. Bezos explains that he sees the concept of \"work-life balance\" as a \"weak\" phrase because it implies that work and life should be mutually exclusive. Bezos concludes that in today's society, work-life balance is impossible to achieve, but putting work and life into a balanced cycle is the key to ensuring the most successful outcome. He believes that work-life balance should not be a dual decision of professional and personal life, but rather a comprehensive approach to achieving a healthy relationship between the two.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".. The S&P 500 index fell 8.6% year-on-year, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 5.6%. Technology giant Nasdaq Composite performed even worse, falling 12.2% at the end of the year. The fourth quarter was tough for the market, as investors had to deal with the current pandemic and uncertain economic outlook. The S&P 500 dropped 8.5% at the end of the quarter, while the Dow Jones fell 5.5% and the Nasdaq fell 9.8%. The main driver of the market loss was the tech sector, which has been hit hard by some of its most popular technology stock sellouts, including Apple and Tesla. The industry fell 20.8% at the end of this year. The financial sector was another weak area, with a 14.5% decline at the end of the year despite rebounding at the end of last year. The energy sector also fell 12.2% year-on-year. Despite the shorter trading hours, the market still suffered losses, with major indexes slightly lower this weekend. The S&P 500 closing rate was 0.4% this week, the Dow Jones fell 0.6%, and the Nasdaq dropped 0.8%. Analysts say the market losses reflect investors' profits after a turbulent year of trading. As the COVID-19 outbreak continues, the economic outlook remains uncertain and many investors are reluctant to commit to long-term market positions. Looking ahead, analysts say the market may remain sluggish in the short term as investors try to assess the economic outlook. This will largely depend on advances in vaccine rollout and the effectiveness of stimulus measures. In addition, there are concerns about corporate earnings prospects. Analysts expect revenue growth to slow significantly in 2021 due to uncertain economic outlook and the ongoing impact of the outbreak. Despite market losses, the US stock market remains attractive compared to other markets around the world. According to S&P Global, the S&P 500 is traded at a price ratio of 26.5, which is higher than the historical average of 16.6. Overall, 2020 will be a volatile year for markets, but analysts say the outlook for 2021 remains uncertain. As markets try to cope with the current pandemic and the economic outlook for 2021, investors should prepare for more volatility in the coming months.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".. With the recent release of Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Scarlet on Nintendo Switch, \"Pokemon\" fans around the world are excited to welcome a new four-man Classic. After all, \"Pokemon\" is the ultimate challenge for all 'Pokemon' games, and nothing is more exciting than defeating them in the end. First, it's important to understand the types of Pokemon that are unique to each member of the Big Four. This not only allows you to know the types of Pokemon that fight with you, but also gives you a general idea of what actions you should get from your opponent. Understanding the types of Pokemon that are unique to each member of the Big Four can help you prepare for battle and give you an advantage in fighting. The first member of the elite four is Gardenia, who specializes in grass-style Pokemon. If you want to give her a tough fight, be sure to bring all types of fire, fly and ice Pokemon.Gadria's team tends to have an advantage over water type and terrain Pokemon, so be sure to bring various types of Pokemon against her team. The second elite four is Agatha, who specializes in ghost poker. Fighting with Agatha isn't easy because her Ghost Poker Mons are particularly resistant to attacks of common battle types and dark types. In order to fight Agatha, be sure to bring a lot of Spirit and Fairy Poker Mons. Also, remember that Ghost Poker Mons are especially vulnerable to normal and combat movements. The third elite four is Sidney, who specializes in black poker. Sidney's team is very difficult to compete with because dark poker machines are particularly resistant to combat moves and can easily remove fairies and mental poker machines. In order to deal with Sidney, it is important to bring psychological and combat-like turns and ensure that they are freely used. Flint's team struggled with it because they were particularly resistant to grass, ice and water. In order to fight against Flint, it was important to carry a variety of terrain and rock-based poker machines. Moreover, Flint's fire-type poker machines are especially vulnerable to water and combat actions, so be sure to bring plenty of poker machines into these types of movements. In addition to Pokemon with weaknesses that can fight against each of the elite four types, it's important to consider the type of action every Pokemon will use. Elite Four are powerful coaches who can easily counteract movements you aren't ready for. To ensure you have an advantage in battle, make sure your Pokemon knows what moves the Elite Four team won't be able to back up easily. Finally, make sure you take the time to fight against the elite four. The battle can be intense and overwhelming, but it's important to take the time to analyze each situation and choose the right course of action. This may be the difference between success and failure in combat, so make sure you don't rush through the fight. With these tips and tricks in mind, you should be well equipped to join the elite quartet of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. Good luck in battle!", "label": "machine"}

But many worry that the Fed has overcorrected, putting the economy at risk of a serious slowdown.\n\nMortgage rates today\n\nMortgage type Average rate today This information has been provided by Zillow.

This is a 15-basis-point increase from the previous week.\n\nThe 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is the most common type of home loan. With this type of mortgage, you'll pay back what you borrowed over 30 years, and your interest rate won't change for the life of the loan.\n\nThe lengthy 30-year term allows you to spread out your payments over a long period of time, meaning you can keep your monthly payments lower and more manageable. The trade-off is that you'll have a higher rate than you would with shorter terms or adjustable rates.\n\n15-year fixed mortgage rates\n\nThe average 15-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.68%, a single basis point decrease from the prior week, according to Freddie Mac data.\n\nIf you want the predictability that comes with a fixed rate but are looking to spend less on interest over the life of your loan, a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage might be a good fit for you. Because these terms are shorter and have lower rates than 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, you could potentially save tens of thousands of dollars in interest. However, you'll have a higher monthly payment than you would with a longer term.\n\nHow do Fed rate hikes affect mortgages?\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been increasing the federal funds rate to try to slow economic growth and get inflation under control. So far, inflation has slowed somewhat, but it's still well above the Fed's 2% target rate.\n\nMortgage rates aren't directly impacted by changes to the federal funds rate, but they often trend up or down ahead of Fed policy moves. This is because mortgage rates change based on investor demand for mortgage-backed securities, and this demand is often impacted by how investors expect Fed hikes to affect the broader economy.\n\nAs inflation starts to come down, mortgage rates should, too. But the Fed has indicated that it's watching for sustained signs of slowing inflation, and it's not going to stop hiking rates any time soon \u2014 though it may start opting for smaller hikes at its next few meetings.\n\nWhen will mortgage rates go down?\n\nMortgage rates increased dramatically in 2022, but they've started to trend down somewhat over the past couple of months.\n\nIn November 2022, the Consumer Price Index rose 7.1% year-over-year, a significant slowdown compared to the previous month. This is good news for mortgage borrowers and the broader economy.\n\nAs inflation comes down, mortgage rates likely will, too. But the Fed is looking for sustained signs of slowing inflation, which means it's not likely to stop hiking rates any time soon, though officials have said they expect to start slowing the pace of hikes. This should help ease the upward pressure on mortgage rates.\n\nAre HELOCs a good idea right now?\n\nMany homeowners gained a lot of equity over that past couple of years as home prices increased at an unprecedented rate. But because rates are so high now, tapping into that equity can be expensive.\n\nFor homeowners looking to leverage their home's value to cover a big purchase \u2014 such as a home renovation \u2014 a home equity line of credit (HELOC) may still be a good option.\n\nA HELOC is a line of credit that lets you borrow against the equity in your home. It works similarly to a credit card in that you borrow what you need rather than getting the full amount you're borrowing in a lump sum.\n\nDepending on your finances and the type of HELOC you get, you may be able to get a better rate with a HELOC than you would with a home equity loan or a cash-out refinance. Just keep in mind that HELOC rates are variable, so if rates start to trend up further, yours will likely increase, as well.", "label": "human"}

Non-members may not get competitive rates\n\nWho is no medical exam life insurance meant for?\n\nA no medical exam life insurance policy may hold a certain appeal for older applicants and those in failing health. However, the life insurance market is the opposite of what you might expect. These policies are best for young people (typically under 50 years old) in good health. The no medical exam process is often more efficient, streamlining your approval, and life insurance companies can only do this with low-risk applicants.\n\nIf a provider sees red flags that might disqualify you, it won't necessarily prevent you from getting coverage. Instead, the agent would most likely offer to run more conventional life insurance quotes for you.\n\nWhat types of no medical exam life insurance can I get?\n\nMany no medical exam life policies share the obvious features of no medical exams, faster underwriting, and higher premiums for lower benefits. Exceptions apply depending on the insurer. Even within this type of life insurance, providers offer different plans.\n\nAccelerated underwriting life insurance\n\nAccelerated underwriting may seem like a given with no medical exam life insurance. To some degree, it is. This type of life insurance policy uses electronic resources to gather information and run algorithms to evaluate risk. This system then sets your coverage and premiums.\n\nWhile the sources could expand in the future, accelerated underwriting uses a few basic things: criminal records, prescription drug records, and motor vehicle records. All of this creates a risk profile used to bind policies. Because of public records information, the pricing on this type of no medical exam life insurance is most likely comparable to standard life policies. Depending on the available information and other factors, this underwriting process could take longer than a traditional medical exam life policy.\n\nSimplified issue life insurance\n\nSimplified issue life insurance streamlines the underwriting process with no medical exam. Instead, applicants answer a few basic health questions. This policy type will be more expensive for less coverage later on. Companies are taking a more considerable risk by not going through a thorough underwriting process with extra verification. So the premium rises to counterbalance the risk.\n\nGuaranteed issue insurance\n\nThink of this as the life insurance automatically purchased by your employer. It could also be a life policy offered by your bank or credit union. Payouts are small. Generally, these policies cover death benefits like funeral costs and a small allowance for family members after death. As the name suggests, applicants will not be denied. One thing to keep in mind is these policies often use a graded death benefit. In other words, your chosen beneficiary will not get the full benefit if you pass away within the first year after binding the policy.\n\nCompare the best no medical exam life insurance\n\nBest online resources: Haven Life\n\nHaven Life offers term policies for healthy adults with limits as high as $3 million. For adults who prefer to avoid a medical exam, the limit is $500,000.

Ethos Life accepts applicants up to age 65 with a 100% online application process. Limits are as high as $2 million.\n\nEthos Life asks a few basic medical questions, but coverage is effective immediately once approved.

Some companies issue policies without asking medical questions, but underwriting involves risk assessment. Whether due to age, prescription history, or other medical history, buyers should have life insurance alternatives involving a medical exam.\n\nThe following companies are the highest-ranked life insurance companies according to the 2022 J.D. Power U.S. Individual Life Insurance Study on overall customer satisfaction.\n\nWhy trust our recommendations?\n\nLife insurance companies have introduced living benefits/accelerated death benefits and other options to use policies as investment tools. As the name suggests, death benefits do not pay until after the buyer's death. Regardless, Personal Finance Insider knows how important it is to identify the right insurance company for your needs.\n\nAll insurance reviews and articles are fact-checked, and rates are checked at the time of our review. Our responsibility is to our readers, which means providing the most accurate information to guide you in the right direction. Our editor's ratings are based on insurance guidelines, performance, and more.\n\nOur methodology\n\nThe coverage and riders offered are vital parts of our evaluation. We also look at the speed of payouts, customer satisfaction, and financial strength ratings.

The same considerations are used for all competitors to ensure readers have the edge to make informed decisions in an ever-changing market.\n\nHow to pick the best no medical exam life insurance policy for you\n\nParticularly when choosing life insurance, customization is critical. Buyers don't need to add every rider, but a little research goes a long way in selecting the right company. Some applicants will not qualify for a no medical exam life insurance policy. A life insurance agent can help you run quotes that make sense for you. Then agents can offer realistic insurance policy options and review the costs and benefits of each.\n\nAsking friends and family which insurance agent they use could be your first step to finding the right life policy. Factors like age, medical history, and financial goals play key roles in your decision. So we do not recommend asking loved ones about individual policies. Instead, let a qualified insurance professional find the best policies for you.\n\nFAQs\n\nIs a no medical exam life insurance policy right for me? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. No medical exam policies are easiest for young applicants with no significant health issues. Older applicants can buy with some companies, but acceptance is not guaranteed. If you do not qualify for the no medical exam policy you want, insurance agents can help you explore alternatives. No medical exam policies offer less coverage with higher premiums in most cases.\n\nHow can life insurance companies use my medical history with no medical exam? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. No medical exam means life insurance companies will not check your blood pressure, cholesterol, etc. However, companies have access to prescription history and other personal records, and underwriters base decisions partly on this history.\n\nShould I choose whole or term life policies with no medical exam? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. The rules of term vs. whole life insurance policies are the same with no medical exam as it would be otherwise. A term policy has an expiration date, and extensions or conversions to a whole life policy are not guaranteed. If anything, your rate may be higher if you try to convert your policy. The insurer looks at you just as it would any other applicant of your age, health, etc. A whole life policy locks in premiums and payouts.\n\nAre there alternatives to a no medical exam policy? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Insurance agents can quote you medical exam policies if you're denied a no medical exam option. An experienced agent may be able to assess your application before starting the process to avoid official denials. If you're concerned about premium limits, you can explore options like IUL (indexed universal life) for permanent life insurance that increases your benefit as long as you make premium payments.", "label": "human"}
{"text": ".. French President Emmanuel Macron opened the box of Pandora's foreign policy dilemma for the West, giving Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky \"an unprecedented gift\" of 50 tanks along with armoured personnel carriers and heavy machine guns to strengthen the country's defense against Russian-backed separatists. The move has drawn criticism from some EU countries, who fear the development could lead to a broader arms race with Moscow. But the gift is seen as a sign of support from one of Europe's largest and most influential members, and raises the risk that other countries will lend their support to Ukraine. The West's decision to arm Ukraine is a hotly debated topic, as Russian-backed separatist movements have escalated in the eastern part of the country in recent years. Ukraine has long sought foreign aid to help it protect itself from Russia that annexed Crimea in 2014 and continues to support the resurgence of separatists in the Donbas region. The French tanks were an important victory for Ukraine's international support, which was seen as key to the country's security. They also put tremendous pressure on other EU countries to follow suit lest their collective response to the conflict in Ukraine be viewed as inadequate. The gift of 50 armored vehicles to Ukraine is a much-needed boost for President Zelensky's government, which is fighting Russian-backed rebels in the eastern part of the country. These vehicles come from French forces and are very much in need of assistance for a country that has been shot dead by Russia's military. These tanks are the first deliveries of weapons to Ukraine in the current conflict, and may represent the beginning of a larger package of military assistance from the West. The move sends a clear signal to the Kremlin that the West is prepared to take a tougher stance against Russia's aggression in Ukraine. Russia is unlikely to take the news lightly, and may respond to France's gift with its own military deployment or other countermeasures. However, such a response could push Moscow and the West into deeper conflict. The French tanks represent a breakthrough in Ukraine's longstanding policy of international restrictions and non-intervention. This position was taken after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, and the West has since avoided any direct military intervention. However, with the recent escalation of Russian-backed separatists and the ongoing escalation of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, some countries are now reassessing their policies and considering how best to respond. France's donation of tanks to Ukraine could spark a sensible debate in the West about the wisdom of further arms transfers to that country. It could also open the door for greater intervention and stronger efforts to prevent conflict. At the same time, it may force the United States and other Western countries to think seriously about the consequences of a more robust response to Russian aggression. To be effective, any Western counter-attack must proceed in ways that avoid further escalation of tensions with Russia. The French president's decision to supply Ukraine with tanks is bold and will undoubtedly have far-reaching consequences for conflicts in Ukraine and elsewhere. While tanks may be the first step toward Western support for Ukraine, the international community must take a cautious approach considering the risk of further aggravating the situation.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Christian Childers, 26, is survived by his fiancee and young sons. He tried to clean up the mold before he fell ill. Courtesy of Lorie Peterson\n\n26-year-old Christian Childers died Monday after long-term exposure to toxic mold. Mold grew in his family's home after flooding from Hurricane Ian last September. Childers' asthma made him particularly susceptible to health risks from mold.\n\n\n\nInstead of spending time with his family at home, 26-year-old Christian Childers spent Christmas Eve in the hospital in a medically induced coma after a severe asthma attack led to cardiac arrest. The potential cause of this asthma attack: toxic mold that had been growing in his apartment for months.\n\nChristian Childers and his fianc\u00e9e Kendra Elliot first noticed the mold growing after Hurricane Ian flooded their home in September, Elliot told NBC affiliate WBBH-TV.\n\nDespite attempts to get in contact with FEMA and the Red Cross, the family was forced to live with the mold for months, according to a GoFundMe set up by a family friend. The couple moved their family of five into the living room to avoid the toxic growth, but the mold continued to affect Childers, who had asthma and had to go to the hospital multiple times.\n\nOn December 24, Childers suffered an asthma flare-up and was struggling to breathe, Elliot told WBBH-TV. They went to his parents house, where he still wasn't able to catch his breath, and then to the emergency room.\n\n\"They were on their way to the emergency room, and they didn't make it,\" Elliot told the local news station. \"They had to pull into a fire station, and he went into cardiac arrest. He died, and they had to work on him for an hour to get his heartbeat back before they got him on the way to the hospital.\"\n\nChilders was initially put into a medically induced coma in the hospital to give his body a chance to recover from a hypoxic brain issue caused by a lack of oxygen, but on January 2 he died.\n\nAdditionally, during Childers' hospital stay the family's landlord sent them an eviction notice, which has been reviewed by Insider. Lorie Peterson, a friend of the family, said Elliot and her mother and two sons are still searching for a new place to live.\n\nStory continues\n\nMold is particularly dangerous for people with lung diseases like asthma\n\nMold stains on a damp wall. Ekspansio/Getty Images\n\nMold growth in the home is usually related to excess moisture in the environment \u2014 for instance, a Category 4 storm can cause plenty of water-related damage. Some molds can release toxins into the air, which can irritate the lungs, but not all molds found in the home are toxic.\n\nWhile most people won't suffer health effects from living in a home with small amounts of mold, it can be dangerous for people with lung diseases or people who are immunocompromised.\n\nPeople with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or compromised immune systems should not stay in a moldy home, even while it is being cleaned, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Severe reactions to mold can include fevers and shortness of breath.\n\nOtherwise healthy people can experience symptoms from mold exposure including coughing and wheezing.\n\nWhat to do if there is mold in your home\n\nThe best way to stop mold exposure is prevent it from growing in the first place.\n\nThe CDC recommends that people control humidity levels in their homes through ventilating bathrooms, laundry and cooking areas; promptly fix leaks; and thoroughly clean and dry after flooding. Using an air conditioner or dehumidifier during humid and warm months can be helpful, as well as avoiding carpeting rooms that may gather moisture, like bathrooms.\n\nIf, however, you can already see or smell mold in your home, you should try to remove it as soon as possible using commercial cleaning products or a mixture of bleach and water. If the mold covers a large area, it is best to get professional help, and you may need to vacate the home while it is being cleaned.\n\nRead the original article on Insider", "label": "human"}

{"text": ".. Boeing's aircraft deliveries continued to be hampered by deficiencies in its 737 model fuselage, leading to a significant drop in overall deliveries in October. The company said Tuesday that the Chicago-based aircraft manufacturer delivered nine new planes in October, down from 19 in September and just one third of a year ago's 27. The decline in deliveries was mainly due to fuselage defects found in the 737 models, which caused the company to suspend production of aircraft and delay delivery. In addition, the company said that it has been working to reduce its overall production speed due to reduced demand after the coronavirus pandemic. Defects in the fuselage of some models of the 737 resulted in significant delays in the delivery schedule. These defects were discovered after a period of high pressure testing, which subsequently affected large numbers of aircraft in the Boeing fleet. The company has taken steps to fix the fuselage defects and expects to return to normal production by the end of the year. In addition to the fuselage issue, Boeing has been dealing with supplier production delays and other issues. Despite the temporary setbacks, the company still believes it will eventually be able to deliver the aircraft on time. \"We remain focused on achieving our 2021 production targets, including a sustained growth rate of 31,737 MAX per month by the end of the year,\" Boeing said in a statement. Boeing delivered six 737 Max and three 787 Dreamliners in October. To date, it has delivered 172 aircraft, down from 296 a year ago. The company expects to deliver fewer than 300 aircraft by the end of this year, compared with more than 500 last year. Boeing received only six orders in October, down from 20 a year ago. So far this year, the company has received 173 orders, down from 595 a year ago. As Boeing continues to work on fixing fuselage and dealing with its suppliers, this year's deliveries are likely to be below normal levels. The company may also see fewer orders as the coronavirus outbreak continues to affect the global aviation industry. Despite the challenges, Boeing is optimistic about its future. The company has been testing new technologies such as automated manufacturing, virtual reality and additive manufacturing to speed up production and reduce costs. Boeing has also been working to improve its customer service, including a new website that allows customers to track their orders and get personalized advice. The company has also been investing in new technologies to improve its product line and expand its customer base. It recently announced a partnership with Boom Supersonic to develop a new supersonic aircraft, which is expected to enter service in 2023. Boeing also hopes to take advantage of the growing demand for electric aircraft by developing its own series of electric planes. Despite ongoing challenges, Boeing remains confident that its long-term prospects remain optimistic. The company has ambitious production and delivery targets for this year, but the company is determined to meet them.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "ABSTRACT breaks down mind-bending scientific research, future tech, new discoveries, and major breakthroughs. See More \u2192\n\nScientists at Brookhaven National Laboratory have uncovered an entirely new kind of quantum entanglement, a phenomenon that causes particles to become weirdly linked, even across vast cosmic distances, reports a new study. The discovery allowed them to capture an unprecedented glimpse of the bizarre world inside atoms, the tiny building blocks of matter.\n\nThe mind-bending research resolves a longstanding mystery about the nuclei of atoms, which contain particles called protons and neutrons, and could help shed light on topics ranging from quantum computing to astrophysics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe exciting discoveries took place at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), a specialized facility at Brookhaven in New York that can accelerate charged atoms, known as ions, to almost light speed. When these ions collide\u2014or even just pass near each other\u2014their interactions expose the inner workings of atoms, which are governed by the trippy laws of quantum mechanics.\n\nAll kinds of weird stuff occurs in this tiny realm, but quantum entanglement in particular is so strange that Albert Einstein called it \u201cspooky action at a distance.\" This phenomenon occurs when particles become intertwined with each other, causing their properties (such as spin or momentum) to sync up, even if they are billions of light years apart. Quantum entanglement has been demonstrated countless times in laboratories, but the entangled particles have always belonged to the same group and possessed the same charge, such as photons, which have no charge, or electrons, which are negatively charged.\n\nNow, for the first time ever, scientists at Brookhaven have captured interference patterns that are created by the entanglement of two particles with different charges, a breakthrough that has opened up a completely new window into the mysterious innards of atoms that make up visible matter in the universe, according to a study published on Wednesday in Science Advances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere's never been any measurement in the past of interference between distinguishable particles,\u201d said Daniel Brandenburg, a physics professor at the Ohio State University who co-authored the new study, in a call with Motherboard. \u201cThat's the discovery; the application is that we get to use it to do some nuclear physics.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn't even, in a sense, trying to find something so fundamental about quantum mechanics,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhen we realized that there's something really interesting going on here, that was a really big surprise to me.\u201d\n\nBrandenburg and his colleagues achieved this milestone with the help of a sensitive detector called the Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC, or STAR, that captured interactions between gold ions that were boosted to the brink of light speed. Clouds of photons, which are particles that carry light, surround the ions and interact with another type of particle, called gluons, that hold atomic nuclei together.\n\nThese encounters between the photons and the gluons set off a chain of events that ultimately created two new particles, called pions, which have opposite charges\u2014one positive and one negative. When these pions careened into the STAR detector, the precision instrument measured some of their key properties, such as velocity and angle of impact, which were then used to probe the size, shape, and arrangement of gluons inside the atomic nuclei with a precision that has never been achieved before.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt's like a microscope in the sense that you use a photon to look at something,\u201d Brandenburg explained. \u201cIn this case, we're using really, really high-energy photons, where their wavelength is short enough that we can actually look at the inside of an atom.\u201d\n\nScientists have imaged atomic nuclei at lower energies before, but attempts to probe these structures at high energies has always produced a puzzling result. Nuclei in these experiments look way bigger than they should, according to models, an outcome that has puzzled scientists for decades.\n\nNow, the STAR collaboration has now solved this mystery by pinpointing a blurring effect that is linked to the photons in the experiment. Essentially, past studies captured one-dimensional glimpses of nuclei that did not account for important patterns in photons, such as their polarization direction. The new study included this polarization information, allowing Brandenburg and his colleagues to probe the nuclei from two angles, parallel and perpendicular to the photon\u2019s motion, producing a two-dimensional view that matches theoretical predictions.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the team is even able to make out the rough positions of key particles in the nucleus, such as protons and neutrons, as well as the distribution of gluons. It also offers a new way to unravel persistent mysteries about the behavior of atoms at high energies.\n\n\u201cAs you peer deeper inside the nucleus, to the parts of the nucleus that have less and less energy, they're very important for how the nucleus holds together, but we actually don't know a lot about that part of the nucleus,\u201d Brandenburg said. \u201cSo as you go to higher and higher energies, you really don't know what it looks like.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's why more measurements with higher precision will be poised to really make a statement about this energy dependence and what the heart of the nucleus is doing at these different scales,\u201d he added.\n\nTo that point, Brandenburg hopes to repeat this technique, and versions of it, at RHIC and other facilities like the Large Hadron Collider, in order to tease out the long-hidden details inside atomic nuclei.\n\nGazing into atoms at high energies could help scientists resolve some of the most intractable problems in science, including the grand mystery of how the quantum world can coexist with our reality, which is governed by the much more familiar rules of classical physics. It also has practical applications, especially for quantum computing, a technology that aims to revolutionize computations using the strange rules of the quantum world.", "label": "human"}

There were some options, but most shades, tools, and brands catered to white people.\n\nToday, many people with disabilities might face a similar sense of exclusion when they browse the cosmetics aisle: There are often few, if any, products designed for someone with limited fine motor skills.\n\nA team of L'Or\u00e9al engineers, researchers, and beauty experts is working to change this.\n\nOn Wednesday, at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, L'Or\u00e9al unveiled a handheld, computerized makeup applicator called Hapta. It's designed for people with limited hand and arm mobility.\n\nHapta is a nod to the word haptic, which is a type of vibrating motor technology used in many smartphones and in adaptive devices for people with disabilities. The product is expected to be available in US stores at the end of this year and globally next year at a cost of $149 to $199.\n\nGuive Balooch, the global chief of L'Or\u00e9al's technology incubator \u2014 the division that developed Hapta \u2014 said the move to create more advanced products for people with disabilities in beauty was long overdue.\n\nNow, Balooch said the makeup world was approaching a revolution in technology that could help many with disabilities.\n\n\"The past three to five years has excelled in miniaturizing large-scale machines,\" Balooch said. \"Hapta is essentially a miniature robotic arm that requires lots of machine learning and complicated algorithms. Combine that with our sense of purpose and drive around inclusion, I truly believe this is the result of the marriage of these two forces.\"\n\nMaking makeup application possible for millions\n\nGuive Balooch, the global vice president of L'Or\u00e9al's technology incubator, said a movement in the beauty world on disability inclusion was overdue. L'Or\u00e9al\n\nMakeup applicators for people with disabilities do exist. There are blush brushes designed to be easy to grip or mascara with a large handle that's easier to steady with your fingers. Yet most of these products have been developed by startups or small businesses, not by a major cosmetics company. And L'Or\u00e9al says a high-tech option like Hapta isn't on the market.\n\nThe feedback from Hapta testers with cerebral palsy, with Parkinson's disease, and from people affected by a stroke has been positive, Balooch said.\n\n\"They told us they didn't feel they could be part of this industry,\" he said. \"Having someone else apply it wasn't enough for them. They wanted to apply makeup on their own. They now feel they can be part of this.\"\n\nHapta is essentially a miniature robotic arm that helps users stabilize a tube and apply lipstick. L\u2019Or\u00e9al\n\nApproximately 10 million Americans have essential tremor, a neurological movement disorder that often causes the hands to shake. Nearly 1 million people in the US have Parkinson's disease, and some 764,000 Americans have at least one symptom of cerebral palsy. Both Parkinson's and cerebral palsy can affect hand and arm mobility.\n\n\"People who could never apply lipstick before can now do that,\" Balooch said. \"There's a confidence that comes from that. That's what our user feedback has been.\"\n\nL'Or\u00e9al began developing Hapta about a year ago, after Balooch met with Anupam Pathak, the CEO of Liftware, a startup that created high-tech eating utensils for people with a tremor or limited hand or arm mobility. Pathak and Balooch started talking about how Liftware users asked whether the company could create tools for applying makeup.\n\n\"This was codesigned with people with cerebral palsy, people with Parkinson's, and experts in the field,\" Balooch said. \"I hope this will inspire the industry. It's not just something that these people deserve \u2014 it's deeply linked to our purpose.\"\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's Hapta lipstick applicator is set to be available in US stores sometime this year at a cost of $149 to $199. L\u2019Or\u00e9al\n\nOver the past few years, Balooch said, L'Or\u00e9al engineers have been working to make the company's packaging easier to open for people with disabilities. L'Or\u00e9al has also been expanding the use of QR codes on its products to help people with limited visibility learn more about an item.\n\nHapta is set to be compatible only with Lanc\u00f4me lipsticks for now, though L'Or\u00e9al plans to create fittings that would make the device adaptable with other lipsticks.\n\n\"The reality is that people who have motor-skills or hand-mobility impairments need to be able to do daily tasks,\" Balooch said. \"It is time for this type of technology.\"", "label": "human"}
{"text": "From their investments. Investing in sports teams is a dream for many people, but it often doesn't pay off for the few who succeed in achieving that goal. This is what new owners of some of the world's top football clubs do. Over the past 10 years, several of Europe's most notable sports acquisitions have been made by European football giants, with owners of clubs such as Manchester United, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain spending hundreds of millions of dollars in pursuit of glory. But the benefits of these investments have varied widely, with some teams seeing significant increases in value while others see no return at all. Its current owner, U.S. business giant Joel Glazer, bought it in 2005 for PS790 million ($1.07 billion). However, more than a decade later, the club's estimated value was only PS2.21 billion ($2.97 billion) - just over PS430 million ($571 million) of Graz's payment. Or take Paris Saint-Germain, for example, where Qatar Sports Investments bought the French club in 2011 for about PS130 million ($173 million). Over the years, its value has soared to around PS2.36 billion ($3.16 billion), with a huge return on investment of more than PS2 billion ($2.66 billion). Manchester United's lack of profitability is largely due to its huge payroll, which must be cut sharply after Glazer takes over. Meanwhile, Qatar has taken a very different approach to Paris Saint-Germain, investing heavily in players and infrastructure, making the team enormously successful and more attractive to sponsors. There are multiple motivations for wealthy individuals or organizations to buy clubs, from having one of the world's most famous teams to potentially earning a return on running a successful business. But it is important to remember that investing in football doesn't always pay off. After all, buying a football club is like any other investment. For the fortunate few, it may pay off. But for many more, it can be an expensive effort with little to no return.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Sony has unveiled its latest entry into the world of game accessibility: Project Leonardo, an advanced controller for the upcoming PlayStation 5 console. The company unveiled this controller at the PlayStation 5 show on September 16, which is designed for physically disabled players and offers them a variety of options to customize the functions of the controller according to their individual needs. The project Leonardo is the result of a two-year collaboration between Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) and accessibility expert AbleGamers, a nonprofit organization that helps people with disabilities enjoy digital entertainment. The controller's design is similar to the dual-sensual 5 controller Sony announced earlier this year, but adds features to better accommodate players with physical disabilities. It has a three-way switch that allows users to customize the functions of the controller. In addition, the controller includes four ports for customizing peripherals and four configuration file switches, so users can quickly switch between settings. The controller is also designed to be easy to reconfigure, so users can adjust their settings while playing the game without having to constantly reconnect hardware. It also has a larger button layout that allows users to access certain features without being nervous. The controller is designed to work with the upcoming PlayStation 5, and will be available alongside the console when released on November 12. It will also be compatible with the PlayStation 4. Sony has not disclosed pricing information for the controller, but it expects its cost to be the same as a standard dual-sensing 5 controller. \"Project Leonardo is a passionate project for us. We strive to create a product that is not only powerful, customizable, but also beautiful in appearance. We hope that Project Leonardo will make it easier for people around the world to use PlayStation,\" said Shawn Layden, president of SIE Global Studios, in a statement. The company also announced the creation of a new accessibility working group that will focus on promoting the PlayStation brand and developing more accessible products and services. The Leonardo controller project is Sony's latest initiative to improve the accessibility of games.The company previously worked with AbleGamers, a barrier-free technology expert, to create a single-hand controller and provide support for visually or hearing impaired players. Sony is clearly committed to making the game more convenient, and the launch of the Leonardo project is an important milestone in this journey. While the controller isn't perfect, it's a big step in the right direction that will give many players with physical disabilities access to and enjoyment of the game.", "label": "machine"}

Then explain your Daily Caller op-ed a week earlier when you wrote, \u201clying to the base is a red line for me.\u201d\n\nYa suppose Greene would\u2019ve been shrieking a different line had Santos been a Democrat?\n\nToo bad Politico can\u2019t go back to New York\u2019s 3rd Congressional District now and talk to Santos supporters before his interview with Gabbard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDaniel Zimmerman, a 70-year-old registered Democrat and no relation to Santos\u2019s Democratic opponent, Robert Zimmerman, told Politico at the time that he\u2019d vote for Santos again despite The Times\u2019 blockbuster account. \u201cI\u2019m a Republican because Democrats, they\u2019re destroying our country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust the Democrats on anything they say,\u201d said another Santos supporter, who wouldn\u2019t give her name for privacy reasons.\n\nI wonder what voters like that are saying now?\n\nOther residents in the district have protested, and Santos has been taking a beating on his Facebook page, but that\u2019s about all voters can do. They can\u2019t recall him. The Constitution contains no such mechanism for recalling federal lawmakers. Santos can only resign or be expelled, which requires a vote of two-thirds of House members.\n\nRepublicans won\u2019t do it. If they did, his district would hold a special election, which a Democrat would almost surely win, shrinking the GOP\u2019s tiny House majority.\n\nInstead, expect this:\n\nHey, Republicans! How will you address the George Santos scandal?\n\nAnswer: Hunter Biden had a laptop.\n\nLegal developments might compel Republicans to vote for expulsion. Santos is facing several potential investigations into his questionable past, which could result in jail time. Certainly a better use of our tax dollars instead of paying his Congressional salary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Santos has yet to admit he lied. Instead, he\u2019s done a linguistic tap dance, calling his lies \u201cembellishments,\u201d a \u201cpoor choice of words,\u201d or the contorted \u201cJew-ish,\u201d to explain his campaign claim about being a \u201cproud American Jew.\u201d (His district is more than 20 percent Jewish.)\n\n\u201cA lot of people overstate on their resumes or twist a little bit,\u201d Santos told WABC radio.\n\nI see. Everyone else is doing it. That\u2019s the excuse we make to justify doing something we know is wrong. I\u2019ve never understood why \u201ceveryone else is doing it\u201d is such an attractive idea to a nation that prides itself on its individuality as ours does or why it\u2019s such an attractive idea to any Republican whose party extolls the virtues of personal responsibility and accountability.\n\nConservative outlets certainly aren\u2019t going there. Those that once embraced Santos are now ignoring him. It\u2019s easier to find the Gabbard interview on Google than on the Fox News website. I couldn\u2019t find a single criticism of Santos on any major conservative outlet. Whadda surprise!\n\nThese are the guys who say they want their country back. Funny, in his first inaugural address, President Dwight Eisenhower warned: \u201cA people that values its privileges above its principles soon lose both.\u201d", "label": "human"}
{"text": "FIFA World Cup 2021 FTX Japan, one of Japan's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, announced on Monday that it plans to return assets to customers starting in February 2021. The move comes as the exchange continues its efforts to improve security and comply with Japanese financial instruments and trading laws. FTX Japan is the Japanese branch of FTX, a global cryptocurrency exchange established in 2018, with headquarters in San Francisco and offices in Tokyo, Hong Kong and New York.FTX Japan has been registered in Japan since October 2019. At a news conference in Tokyo on Monday, FTX Japan CEO Mikehata Tsuyoshi said the exchange had identified security improvements needed to meet requirements of Japanese financial instruments and trading laws. \"At FTX Japan, we strive to be a leader in cryptocurrency security and compliance.In order to comply with regulations and protect customers' assets, we have decided to return the assets to customers from February 2021,\" he said. McHatta also said that the company is considering several different ways to ensure a safe return on assets, including using \"cold storage\" technology and enhanced security protocols. He stressed that FTX Japan is committed to ensuring the safety and security of its customers' assets. \"At FTX Japan, customer safety is our top priority,\" he said. \"We are committed to ensuring that our customers' assets are secure and they have access to their funds at all times.\" In addition to improving the security protocol, Mikehata also revealed that FTX Japan has entered into a partnership with Japanese banking giant Mizuho to develop a digital currency settlement system called \"JBCS\", which will allow digital currency transactions between customers and merchants, expected to be launched in March 2021. The CEO also stressed that FTX Japan is working with the Japanese government to obtain regulatory approval for exchange operations. This includes obtaining approval from the Financial Services Authority of Japan (FSA), which oversees digital currency transactions in the country. \"We are getting regulatory approval from the FSA,\" Mikehata said, \"and we expect this process to be completed in the near future and we believe that we will be able to launch our services in a way that meets requirements.\" FTX Japan's move to return assets to customers marks an important step in the regulation of Japanese digital currency exchanges. This decision may have a positive impact on investors' confidence in the country's cryptocurrency market and encourage further investment in the sector.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "It's a quiet Friday night at Rugley Stadium, where the Chicago Cubs are about to face the St. Louis Red Ranger in their first game of the season. The starting lineup has been set and expectations are obvious. But there is one name that stands out particularly: Tucker Barnhart. The 26-year-old catcher was acquired by the Cincinnati Reds in the playoffs, and he entered the game with impressive credentials. He has won two All-Star awards in the secondary league, twice the Reds' Defense Player of the Year award, and dropped more than 40 percent of attempted base robbers during his eight year career. But despite so much credit, what sets Barnhart apart from the other new players in the Cubs is his potential impact on the team's pitchers. During his career, he was known as one of the best pitchers in the league, which meant that he was able to cleverly push the ball into the strike zone, giving the pitcher an edge in a stressful situation. The start of the Bears' rotation - including Kyle Hendricks and Yu Darvish as well as leftist Jose Quintana - is already one of the best in the game, and Barnhart may add additional controls to an already solid pitcher. But how can he do that? The answer lies in the field of psychology. According to Dr. Kenneth Laviza, a professor of sports psychology at California State University Fullerton, the key to successful betting is expectation and visualization. When placing a bet, the gambler must have a clear plan before starting an action, he must be able to clearly imagine the bets in his head and have a good sense of what happens next. By cleverly dragging the ball into the impact zone, Barnhart can help the pitcher focus on the desired goal and thus make it easier to imagine a successful bet. In addition, Barnhart is able to accurately predict the move of the pitcher and give him time to adjust his structure if needed. \"It's one thing to be able to read the pitch before throwing.\" But it's another thing to be able to read a pitcher's body language and explain his movements. It takes years of practice and experience to do this, but Barnhart has been able to consistently do so for a long time, which is an incredible asset for any pitcher,\" Laviza said. In addition to his framework skills, Barnhart brings with him an experienced presence and understanding of how the pitcher thinks, which is invaluable for the Young Bears. \"He's seen a lot of different situations and he's been very successful. His behavior is very calm and he communicates well with the pitcher. He's the kind of person you want, because he knows how to handle the business and understand the game,\" said Joe Maddon, Little Bears head coach. As the season progresses, Barnhart's influence on the Cubs pitchers will be interesting. But one thing is certain: if the Cubs are to succeed this year, then veteran chasers like Barnhart will become a huge asset.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".. King Abdullah II of Jordan has warned that Jerusalem is crossing the \"red line\" as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu resumes his fifth term in office. The country's monarch, an ally of the Jewish state, fears the potential consequences for peace and stability in the Middle East if long-term agreements are not respected. \"We believe that all peace agreements should be respected and their red lines protected, especially with regard to Jerusalem,\" he said in a rare televised speech. We believe that we need to actively oppose any attempt to change its historical status quo, which will have a serious impact on the security and stability of the region. He warned that \"Jerusalem is the red line between Jordan and all of us Arabs and Muslims\" and noted that Jordan will always be committed to protecting the city's holy sites. The King's remarks came after the Israeli Prime Minister formed his next coalition government following a fiercely contested election. Polls conducted after a quick vote in March showed that Netanyahu and his right-wing Likud party had an overwhelming victory. The 77-year-old leader has been in power for 11 consecutive years and will be sworn in for a fifth term once his coalition is finalized. Netanyahu has been a strong advocate of annexing much of the occupied West Bank, a move that could lead to further erosion of an internationally-backed two-State solution. The Prime Minister has repeatedly announced his intention to continue the construction of settlements on Palestinian land. His election victory was a blow to the Palestinians and those who wished to resume the barbaric peace process. The United Nations, the European Union and other world leaders have expressed concern over Netanyahu's commitment, particularly his proposed annexation plan. \"Jordan will not stand idly by when our brothers and sisters in Palestine suffer from attempts to prevent them from enjoying their rights to freedom, justice and dignity,\" he said. \"As long as these rights are denied, the prospects for peace and security in our region remain elusive,\" he added. In his covert criticism of Netanyahu, King Abdullah urged the Israeli government to seek peace and not \"further exacerbate the already turbulent environment in the region.\" He called on the international community to take action and said Jordan would continue to push for recognition of a Palestinian state based on its pre-1967 borders. He also vowed to work closely with the incoming Israeli government, stressing his country's commitment to peace and stability in the region. \"Jordan will continue to act actively in the regional and international arena, developing our vision for a comprehensive peace based on international law and relevant UN Security Council resolutions,\" he said. At the end of his speech, the King said that he had full confidence in the ability of the Jordanian people to defend their national interests and protect Jerusalem's holy sites. The news sent a clear signal to Israel and its prime minister that any violation of the status quo in Jerusalem would not be accepted, particularly by Jordan.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Jan 3 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever.\n\nGlobal market trading properly kicks into gear on Tuesday, with the latest insight into how China's manufacturing sector closed last year likely to set the tone for the day ahead in Asia.\n\nChina's Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers index for December is expected to remain in recessionary territory for a fifth straight month, falling to 48.8 from 49.4 in November.\n\nThis follows official PMI data at the weekend that showed the sharpest pace of contraction in December in nearly three years as COVID-19 infections swept through production lines after Beijing's abrupt reversal of anti-virus measures.\n\nchart\n\nThe world's second-largest economy is going through an incredible amount of economic, political and social upheaval, which will be intensified in the coming weeks and months by Beijing's recent U-turn on its zero-COVID policy.\n\nUK-based health data firm Airfinity estimates that around 9,000 people in China are probably dying each day from COVID, and expects COVID cases to reach their first peak on Jan. 13 with 3.7 million daily infections.\n\nChina firing on something approaching all cylinders would offer a much-needed boost to the world economy this year. The impact on asset markets, however, is less obvious as potential inflationary pressures from the economic reopening could force central banks to keep interest rates higher for longer.\n\nchart\n\nThe consensus among economists that the U.S. economy will slip into recession this year is unusually and remarkably strong. This points to a poor outlook for earnings and equity performance, even if some investors say this is the perfect set-up for a contrarian bullish investment strategy.\n\nIn the near term, however, China COVID fears may overshadow the long-term benefits and weigh on sentiment accordingly.\n\nIt's fair to say investors are glad to see the back of 2022. World stocks lost around $14 trillion and posted their second-worst annual performance on record, and bonds had their worst year in decades. Together, a typical '60-40' portfolio of stocks and bonds had one of their worst years in almost a century.\n\nMuch of that can be blamed on nearly 300 rate hikes around the world last year. But while much of the global tightening has been delivered the full effects have not been felt.\n\nA cautious start to the year for markets, and a gloomy Chinese PMI report, would come as no surprise.\n\nThree key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Tuesday:\n\n- Australia manufacturing PMI (December)\n\n- China Caixin manufacturing PMI (December)\n\n- U.S. manufacturing PMI (December)\n\nReporting by Jamie McGeever in Orlando, Fla.; Editing by Jonathan Oatis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n\nOpinions expressed are those of the author.

{"text": "How Cars and Batteries Are Changing the World Tesla's rapid rise to become the world's most valuable automaker comes with many compelling images, many of which show the potential of the electric vehicle revolution and the company's ambition. But every photo, from the first Tesla Roadsters produced at a factory in Fremont, California, to a large battery plant in Nevada, tells different parts of the story. This photo shows the first Tesla Roadster to launch a production line at its Fremont plant in 2008, predicting that electric vehicles will enter the mainstream car market. The Roadster, which sold about $100,000 at the time, was the company's first all-electric vehicle. While it failed to gain mass market appeal, it demonstrated Tesla's ambition and helped kick off the electric car revolution. The Model S luxury sedan, introduced in 2012, replaced the Roadster. But it was the launch of a smaller and cheaper Model 3 that pushed Tesla into the mainstream, with demand rapidly outpacing the company's production capacity. This bottleneck was alleviated in 2017 when Tesla opened the world's largest battery production facility, Gigafactory, in Nevada. The large factory produces batteries for the company's cars as well as its \"Powerwall\" home battery systems and commercial energy storage products. Tesla's success in recent years has benefited from the growing demand for electric vehicles, which helped the company reduce its reliance on internal combustion engines. The growing popularity of electric vehicles is evident in this photo - shown lining up at charging stations in California. Electric vehicle sales are expected to more than double by 2023, with some predicting that they will dominate the car market by 2030. The growing demand for electric vehicles is also driving a new era of competition in the automotive industry, as other automakers are rushing to produce their own. This is due to the growing popularity of lithium-ion batteries, which are the main power source for electric vehicles. The number of global lithium-ion battery plants is expected to exceed 50 by 2024, up from about 20 in 2018. The growing popularity of lithium-ion batteries has also made electric vehicles more affordable, with some now costing roughly the same as conventional gasoline or diesel cars. This photo shows workers who installed lithium-ion batteries at the Tesla Gigafactory plant in Nevada, which is now producing batteries at an unprecedented rate. The increase in battery production has helped reduce the cost of electric vehicles, making them a more attractive option for consumers. But there is still work to be done before electric vehicles become truly popular. The cost of batteries still accounts for a large part of the total cost of electric vehicles, and the battery production process still releases significant amounts of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. But despite these challenges, Tesla's rapid rise shows that electric cars are no longer just a dream. The company's success has helped transform the automotive industry and changed the world's perception of cars, batteries, and electric vehicles.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The Semiconductor Revolution Since then, semiconductor companies have become the cornerstone of the electronics industry, creating and designing innovative powerful devices that power our daily lives. From computers and smartphones to medical devices and cars, semiconductors are everywhere and have become an important part of the technology landscape. Category: Semiconductor companies Semiconductor companies are large multinational organizations that design, manufacture and sell semiconductor products to design and develop new chips, circuits and components for consumer goods which can be found in almost every industry. For example, Intel is one of the world's most prominent semiconductor companies, headquartered in California, that makes chips for consumer PCs, laptops and mobile devices. Since the 1980s, its microprocessors have been powering PCs, and since then has expanded its product range to include other consumer electronics such as tablets and smartphones. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is another large, California-based semiconductor company that was founded in 1969 to produce computer processors and graphics cards for the consumer market. The AMD Ryzen and Radeon product range has won widespread attention among consumers and businesses. The microchip industry also includes large enterprises such as Texas Instruments, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Qualcomm, which produce chips for various consumer products, provide chips for consumer electronics, automotive applications, and are responsible for developing a series of technologies such as digital signal processors (DSP), Wi-Fi chips, modems, processor cores, microcontrollers and embedded microprocessors. How Chips Operate Our Daily Life Semiconductor chips are used in a wide variety of devices, from cars and smartphones to medical devices and robots. Chips are the brains of these devices that control how they interact with us. In today's world, it is impossible to imagine a world without semiconductors. In cars, semiconductor chips can be used for a variety of tasks, from controlling the car's lights and engines to radio, navigation systems, brakes and safety systems. Semiconductor chips also power the car's entertainment system, enabling drivers to listen to music, make calls and access various applications. Of course, smartphones use semiconductor chips to power their operating systems, cameras, apps and other functions. Without these chips, the smartphone will not be able to connect to the Internet, access data or allow users to take photos and videos. In the medical industry, semiconductor chips are used to diagnose diseases, control medical equipment and monitor patients' health. They can be used to control imaging systems such as CT scans and MRI, and even help doctors provide accurate treatment. Finally, semiconductor chips are also used in robots to help them perform complex tasks and interact with the world around them. They are used in industrial robots, self-driving cars and even artificial intelligence systems. II. Conclusions It is clear that semiconductor chips have become an integral part of our lives. From powering our cars to monitoring our health, semiconductor companies are a key component of the global economy and will continue to drive innovation and growth in the coming years.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Aldi is now the fastest growing grocery store in America. Just a few years ago, this small German convenience store chain was almost unheard of in the United States, but thanks to its low prices and smoke-free retail approach, it has become one of the world's largest retail chains, taking over U.S. and European grocery channels. The story of Aldi goes back more than a century, until 1913, when two brothers Karl and Theo Albrecht opened their first small grocery store in Essen, Germany. The parents of the Albrechts were former grocery owners, so it seemed natural for their sons to follow in their footsteps. Initially, the Albrecht brothers operated two stores: one called Aldi Nord, which focused on selling agricultural products and other perishable foods; and another named Aldi Sud, which specialized in dry goods and packaging. Their main strategy was to sell only the most essential products and keep prices low by negotiating discounts with manufacturers. In the 1950s, the brothers split Aldinoder and Aldistud's businesses into separate companies, each of which began to expand its own stores in Germany. Karl opened stores in Europe, while Theo focused on expanding and adding more stores in Germany. By 1960, there were over 400 Alddy stores in Germany. In the late 1970s, Carl and Theo's sons Karl-Hermann and Theo Jr. took control of both companies. The two brothers had a common vision for Aldi: to provide customers with high quality food and grocery products at low prices while minimizing their workload. To achieve this goal, the brothers decided to focus on a \"limited category\" model. They chose only a small number of products, which allowed them to reduce costs, negotiate deeper discounts with suppliers, and keep prices low. This model later became the Aldi standard. By the mid-1980s, the two companies already had more than 4,000 stores, mostly in Europe.Aldi Nord opened its first store in the United States in 1988 and quickly gained followers among consumers in the Midwest thanks to low prices and convenience of shopping. Aldi Nord's success in the United States prompted Aldi Sud to open its own American stores in the mid-1990s. By 1996, there were more than 200 Aldi stores in the United States. The company continues to expand and today has more than 2,000 Aldi stores in 35 states. The chain is now the fastest growing grocery store in the United States, with more than 20 million customers per week. It has become a major player in the U.S. food market, becoming the third largest grocery chain after Walmart and Kroger. Aldi has also been steadily expanding its presence in other countries, with more than 10,000 stores in 20 countries including Australia, the United Kingdom and Poland. It is estimated that the chain has more than 50 million customers worldwide. The Albrecht brothers had vision and the drive to turn their small family grocery store into one of the largest retail chains in the world. Thanks to their pioneering approach, Aldi has become one of the most successful grocery stores in the world.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The stock market experienced a swinging year in 2020, but 2021 was an integration year and investors have been trying to understand the market in the coming recession. This was a year of market turmoil, and investors' perceptions of stocks have changed dramatically. There are many uncertainties about the direction of the market, but one thing is certain: investors have been paying close attention to stock valuations. One way to understand the value of a stock is through multiples. Multiples, or the ratio of price to earnings, are ways to compare one stock with another and measure its performance relative to similar stocks. The lower the multiplier, the better the performance of that stock relative to similar stocks. A stock's multiple may rise or fall, depending on a variety of factors, including the industry in which it is located, the size of the company, and the overall state of the market. This means that there can be two different multiples for the same stock at different points in time. When the economy slows, stock prices may fall, which means that investors need to keep a close eye on companies' valuations to ensure they don't pay too much for stocks. And as we enter a period of heightened risk of recession, multiple factors become more important. The good news is that even after this year's strong market rebound, many stocks are trading at relatively low multiples. This means investors can still get good value from these levels of stock. However, investors should also pay attention to stocks that have high multiples and may be overvalued. These stocks are more vulnerable to downside risks in a recession, and investors should exercise caution. At the same time, investors should also pay attention to stocks with low multiples. While a low multiple may be attractive, it can also be a sign that stocks are undervalued, which could be a sign of fundamental problems for companies. In general, investors should be cautious when using multiples to evaluate stocks and consider other factors such as earnings growth and the overall health of the economy. It's been an interesting year for the market, with investors having to navigate some tricky waters. As we move into 2021, investors should pay close attention to multiple assets and be aware of how they affect stock valuations.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "A woman believed to be the oldest person in America died at age 115. Beulah Koerner, of Braves City Council in Iowa, passed away Sunday morning at the age of 115 years and 148 days, her family told NBC's affiliate WOWT in Omaha. Born in Nebraska on June 24, 1907, Colner lived most of her life in Omaha. She later moved to the Iowa Council Bluffs and died there. Her family said in a statement: \"She is a loving and caring daughter, sister, mother, grandmother, great grandmother and great grandmother.\" She was always willing to share her story, advice and stories of the 'old times'. Corner worked for 15 years in the Omaha Public Power District before retiring in 1973. She subsequently became a cross-border guard at Parliament's Bryce Public School District for more than 10 years. \"My grandmother was a wonderful woman,\" said her granddaughter, Liz Jameson. \"She has lived such a full and long life that is an inspiration to all of us. She will be deeply missed, but she will remain in our memory.\" According to the Gerontology Research Group, Colner is believed to be the oldest person in the United States and the fourth largest living person in the world. At the time of her death, she had only two months to celebrate her 116th birthday, which would make her the world's oldest living person. Corner survived by her two sons, five grandchildren, 13 great-grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. Her death came just days after the death of Edna Parker, who is believed to be the world's oldest person, when she died in November at age 115. Colner and Parker are thought to be the last of a few born in the 19th century. Her death drew attention to a decline in the number of births in the 1800s.

{"text": ".. As early as 2020, Wall Street senior hunt leader Alyson Fisher began to take off. Just five years after her career as executive hiring officer for Wall Street's most powerful companies, Fisher has built an impressive client list and won the respect of peers. But as Fischer's influence grew, so did the number of accusations against her. Ex-clients, colleagues and even family have accused her of verbal and sexual harassment, intimidating clients and potential job seekers, and breaking professional boundaries. \"I've been a victim of her sexual harassment and manipulative abuse for many years,\" one former client told the Wall Street Journal in May 2020, \"and I see her running unforgivingly over others for her own benefit.\" Fisher vehemently denied all claims, but the damage had been done. She was eventually forced to resign from her company and disappeared from public view. The story of Fisher's astonishing rise and dramatic decline illustrates the importance of developing a clear set of codes of conduct and policies to ensure the safety of employees and customers. It also reveals the harsh reality of the Wall Street headhunter world and the consequences of uncontrolled power. A star was born. Fischer was born in Colorado in 1992, grew up in a wealthy family and attended a prestigious private school. She showed the skills of networking and human interaction very early on, and later relied heavily on this trait throughout her career. In 2013, Fisher graduated from college and immediately began her career as a Wall Street recruiter. She quickly caught the attention of some prominent figures in the industry, and by 2015 she had found a senior executive hiring job for one of the top headhunters on the street. At the time, Fisher was only 23 years old. Her youth and relative lack of experience were not considered a disadvantage. Rather, it was seen as a positive asset that allowed her to compete with older, more experienced competitors. Quickly Unsolved Scandals Fisher's success began in April 2020, when an anonymous blog post made a series of accusations against her. The post accused Fisher of sexual harassment, intimidation tactics and personal insults to clients and job applicants. In May 2019, a former client made public his allegations and told the Wall Street Journal that Fisher had sexually harassed him for years. The article quickly spread, with recent clients and colleagues coming forward with their own stories of abuse. In October, a former colleague publicly accused Fisher of creating a hostile work environment, and in December 2020, Fisher's own family accused her of financial and emotional abuse. The Forward Roads Since her resignation in August, Fisher has remained low-key. The exact location of her residence is not known at this time. Her LinkedIn profile has been deleted and a statement on the charges has not yet been made. Nevertheless, Fisher's rapid rise and dramatic decline demonstrate an uncontrolled power that can be accompanied by uncontrolled influence. It also serves as a warning story about the dangers of toxic behavior in the workplace, and reminds us of the need for a clear set of codes of conduct and policies to ensure the safety and well-being of employees and customers.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "In a world getting used to extreme weather, 2023 is starting out more bonkers than ever and meteorologists are saying it\u2019s natural weather weirdness with a bit of help from human-caused climate change.\n\nMuch of what\u2019s causing problems worldwide is coming out of a roiling Pacific Ocean, transported by a wavy jet stream, experts said.\n\nAt least one highway in drought-mired California looked more like a river because of torrential rain from what is technically called an atmospheric river of moisture. New Year\u2019s brought shirtsleeve weather to the U.S. East and record high temperatures to Europe as the Northern Hemisphere on Wednesday was more than 2.6 degrees (1.4 degrees Celsius) hotter than the late 20th century average. And this is after frigid air escaped the Arctic to create a Christmas mess for much of the United States.\n\n\u201cAll the ingredients are in place for two weeks of wild weather especially in the Western U.S.,\u201d private meteorologist Ryan Maue said in an email.\n\nMaue said the big driver is a three-year La Nina\u2014natural temporary cooling of the equatorial Pacific Ocean that alters world weather patterns\u2014that just won\u2019t quit. It is creating literal waves in the weather systems that ripple across the globe. And on certain parts of the waves are storms where the atmospheric pressure drops low and quickly, called bomb cyclones, that are quite wet, and they travel on atmospheric waves that transport the weather called the jet stream.\n\nRead more: \u2018Bomb Cyclone\u2019 and Other Weird Weather Words for Our Climate Change Era\n\nThe jet stream now is unusually wavy, said Maue and Woodwell Climate Research Center climate scientist Jennifer Francis. The storms dip over the warm subtropics \u201cand create a conveyor belt of of moisture to strafe the West Coast of the U.S,\u201d Maue said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d describe the jet stream and bomb cyclones as a runaway Pacific freight train loaded with moisture,\u201d said Maue, former chief scientist of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the Trump administration. \u201cClimate change adds more fuel to the locomotive engine.\u201d\n\nMore than 5 inches of rain fell on Saturday in the Sacramento area and California braced for bigger storms Wednesday and Thursday. As of Wednesday, snowpack was third highest in 40 years, more than 170% of normal.\n\nIn addition to La Nina, a different natural temporary weather event called the Madden-Julian Oscillation enhances storms in the western Pacific, Maue said.\n\nFrancis points to a \u201cblob\u201d of warm sea water off the Aleutian Islands, a phenomena that is happening more often, and a \u2018\u2019crazy warm\u201d Arctic\u2014Wednesday it was 5.8 degrees (3.2 degrees Celsius) warmer than the 1979-2000 average\u2014as part of what\u2019s juicing up the Pacific.\n\nAnd with a wavier than normal jet stream, extremes of all kinds go up and down and around the planet, Francis said.\n\n\u201cYou can think of it like a jump rope. When you start to flick it at one end, that ripple goes through the whole jump rope eventually,\u201d Francis said Wednesday. \u201cAnd so it could be that the waving as such, being perhaps driven in the Pacific, could be accentuating it also over Europe.\u201d\n\nA weather station in Delemont, Switzerland, on the French border, smashed its January record with an average daily temperature of 18.1 degrees Celsius (nearly 65 Fahrenheit) on the first day of the year. In Bucharest, Romania, on Tuesday it broke a January record at 17.2 degrees Celsius (63 degrees Fahrenheit) and it was 17.9 degrees Celsius (64.2 Fahrenheit) in the Russian Republic of Dagestan, according to extreme weather tracker Maximiliano Herrera.\n\nSwiss weather service MeteoSuisse quipped on its blog: \u201c\u2026 this turn of the new year could almost make you forget that it\u2019s the height of winter.\u201d\n\nThis extreme weather has \u201ca silver lining,\u201d especially with the record heat in Europe in January easing winter heating fuel crunches caused by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, said Colorado meteorologist Bob Henson of Yale Climate Connections.

{"text": "ST. LOUIS (AP) \u2014 Unless Missouri Gov. Mike Parson grants clemency, Amber McLaughlin, 49, will become the first transgender woman executed in the U.S. She is scheduled to die by injection Tuesday for killing a former girlfriend in 2003.\n\nMcLaughlin\u2019s attorney, Larry Komp, said there are no court appeals pending.\n\nThe clemency request focuses on several issues, including McLaughlin\u2019s traumatic childhood and mental health issues, which the jury never heard in her trial. A foster parent rubbed feces in her face when she was a toddler and her adoptive father used a stun gun on her, according to the clemency petition. It says she suffers from depression and attempted suicide multiple times.\n\nThe petition also includes reports citing a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, a condition that causes anguish and other symptoms as a result of a disparity between a person\u2019s gender identity and their assigned sex at birth.\n\n\u201cWe think Amber has demonstrated incredible courage because I can tell you there\u2019s a lot of hate when it comes to that issue,\" her attorney, Larry Komp, said Monday. But, he said, McLaughlin's sexual identity is \u201cnot the main focus\u201d of the clemency request.\n\nParson's spokesperson, Kelli Jones, said the review process for the clemency request is still underway.\n\nThere is no known case of a transgender inmate being executed in the U.S. before, according to the anti-execution Death Penalty Information Center. A friend in prison says she saw McLaughlin's personality blossom during her gender transition.\n\nBefore transitioning, McLaughlin was in a relationship with girlfriend Beverly Guenther. McLaughlin would show up at the suburban St. Louis office where the 45-year-old Guenther worked, sometimes hiding inside the building, according to court records. Guenther obtained a restraining order, and police officers occasionally escorted her to her car after work.\n\nGuenther\u2019s neighbors called police the night of Nov. 20, 2003, when she failed to return home. Officers went to the office building, where they found a broken knife handle near her car and a trail of blood. A day later, McLaughlin led police to a location near the Mississippi River in St. Louis, where the body had been dumped.\n\nStory continues\n\nMcLaughlin was convicted of first-degree murder in 2006. A judge sentenced McLaughlin to death after a jury deadlocked on the sentence. A court in 2016 ordered a new sentencing hearing, but a federal appeals court panel reinstated the death penalty in 2021.\n\nOne person who knew Amber before she transitioned is Jessica Hicklin, 43, who spent 26 years in prison for a drug-related killing in western Missouri in 1995. She was 16. Because of her age when the crime occurred, she was granted release in January 2022.\n\nHicklin, 43, began transitioning while in prison and in 2016 sued the Missouri Department of Corrections, challenging a policy that prohibited hormone therapy for inmates who weren\u2019t receiving it before being incarcerated. She won the lawsuit in 2018 and became a mentor to other transgender inmates, including McLaughlin.\n\nThough imprisoned together for around a decade, Hicklin said McLaughlin was so shy they rarely interacted. But as McLaughlin began transitioning about three years ago, she turned to Hicklin for guidance on issues such as mental health counseling and getting help to ensure her safety inside a male-dominated maximum-security prison.\n\n\u201cThere's always paperwork and bureaucracy, so I spent time helping her learn to file the right things and talk to the right people,\" Hicklin said.\n\nIn the process, a friendship developed.\n\n\u201cWe would sit down once a week and have what I referred to as girl talk,\u201d Hicklin said. \"She always had a smile and a dad joke. If you ever talked to her, it was always with the dad jokes.\u201d\n\nThey also discussed the challenges a transgender inmate faces in a male prison \u2014 things like how to obtain feminine items, dealing with rude comments, and staying safe.\n\nMcLaughlin still had insecurities, especially about her well-being, Hicklin said.\n\n\u201cDefinitely a vulnerable person,\" Hicklin said. \u201cDefinitely afraid of being assaulted or victimized, which is more common for trans folks in Department of Corrections.\u201d\n\nThe only woman ever executed in Missouri was Bonnie B. Heady, put to death on Dec. 18, 1953, for kidnapping and killing a 6-year-old boy. Heady was executed in the gas chamber, side by side with the other kidnapper and killer, Carl Austin Hall.\n\nNationally, 18 people were executed in 2022, including two in Missouri. Kevin Johnson, 37, was put to death Nov. 29 for the ambush killing of a Kirkwood, Missouri, police officer. Carman Deck was executed in May for killing James and Zelma Long during a robbery at their home in De Soto, Missouri.\n\nAnother Missouri inmate, Leonard Taylor, is scheduled to die Feb. 7 for killing his girlfriend and her three young children.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "For decades, Americans have been flocking to Florida dreaming of retirement away from the harsh northern winters. But now, more and more taxpayers are finding Sunshine not only a good place to retire, but also a great place to enjoy tax breaks. Because the state also does not impose inheritance taxes, people living in Florida can save a lot of money after their death. Moreover, people living in Florida don't have to pay Social Security or other retirement income taxes. \"It can be a considerable amount of savings,\" said Kelly Viera, Tampa's financial planner, \"and earn tens of thousands of dollars in one lifetime.\" The idea of moving to Florida has become so tempting, with the U.S. Census Bureau reporting that the state's population has increased by more than three million since 2012. But despite the tax advantages, experts warn that moving to Florida isn't always everyone's best bet. One reason is the high cost of living in Florida, especially in the most desirable areas. \"Real estate in Florida can be expensive, just like many other popular states. It has some big cities and then a lot of rural areas that are much cheaper. You just have to decide what kind of lifestyle you want and how much you're willing to pay for it,\" said Marc Madson, financial planner at Fort Lauderdale. Madson also pointed out that even if Florida's taxes were lower than in other states, they would not be enough to offset the higher cost of living. So he advised those considering moving to Florida to carefully calculate costs and benefits before making any decision. \"You should be thinking about more than just taxes,\" he said. \"What is the cost of living, what kind of portfolio do you have, and if you move to Florida, will you be able to maintain your current lifestyle? These are all important questions to consider.\" Another potential disadvantage of moving to Florida is that it can be more difficult to establish a professional network. If you're from abroad, getting into a mature local business community isn't easy. Finally, Florida's lack of income tax could make it harder to access government services. While Florida may offer some property tax breaks, it also relies more on sales taxes to fund public services such as schools and infrastructure. Still, for some people the benefits of living in Florida may outweigh the disadvantages. \"If you want to retire or stay away from the snow and cold, Florida can be a great place,\" Vieira said. \"It offers plenty of sunshine and warmth, plus tax breaks are really helpful. But it's important to remember that doing your homework and making sure you make the right financial decisions is still important.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".. For more than two years, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been investigating former Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) and his brother-in-law Dane Fulmer's involvement in the now dissolved North Carolina hedge fund K Street Partners. According to lawyers familiar with the matter, the SEC quietly ended its investigation of the couple on Tuesday without taking any action against either side. The investigation was launched in January 2019, following news that Burr and his brother-in-law had each sold billions of dollars worth of shares a few weeks before the stock market fell into trouble due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This move raised doubts about their benefit as public officials from classified information, though neither were charged with any misconduct. The SEC's investigation was complex and lengthy, and the committee collected and reviewed a large amount of information.The investigation included interviews with Burr and Fulmer, and extended to other individuals, including other politicians, corporate executives and fund investors. Lawyers familiar with the investigation said the SEC concluded that Burr and Fulmer did not violate any laws or regulations, and that the sale of these shares had nothing to do with the pandemic. The lawyers said the SEC's decision was based on the fact that the transactions were \"overwhelmingly offset\" and there was no evidence that anyone in the transaction received \"any private information\" or \"made a material error or omission\". The SEC declined to comment on the investigation, and Burr and Fulmer did not immediately respond to requests for comment. When the investigation was first launched, Burr described it as \"distracting attention\" and \"wasting taxpayer money.\" Fulmer also defended his actions, telling reporters at the time that he had acted \"entirely appropriately\" in the deal. However, the decision not to take action against Burr and Fulmer did not end the investigation. While the SEC has found no evidence of misconduct, other agencies - including the US Department of Justice and the Senate Ethics Committee - can still initiate investigations on their own. At the time, Burr was chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and had access to sensitive information. He was also an active advocate of legislation that would provide financial relief for individuals and businesses affected by the outbreak, and raised concerns about his stock sales. However, this decision does provide relief to the controversy that has plagued Burr since the investigation. It's not clear whether other agencies will follow in the footsteps of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), but for now, Burr and Fulmer seem to have been defended.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Survivors of a 2017 mass shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, said they find themselves frustrated, confused and angry as the Department of Justice nears its deadline to appeal the decision that found the federal government liable in the attack that killed 26 of their fellow churchgoers.\n\nCritics of the Justice Department\u2019s potential appeal, including the surviving victims, said the agency's stated arguments undermine the background check system \u2014 a cornerstone of President Joe Biden's gun policy priorities. The government's lawyers claimed during the first trial that the gunman could have purchased firearms elsewhere, even if a background check would have prevented him from legally purchasing them from a licensed gun dealer.\n\nThe government has until Jan. 9 to file its appeal, in which it could further argue that the background check system \u2014 a key defense in the United States to ensure guns are not acquired by criminals or people with a history of violence \u2014 does not work, which critics say is a common talking point of the gun lobby.\n\nThe disharmony between the Justice Department\u2019s case and the Biden administration\u2019s gun safety efforts as well as the fears and pressure that a lost appeal could damage gun safety laws are at the crux of the survivors' acrimony.\n\n\u201cIf I had an opportunity to meet President Biden, I would ask him, \u2018Why? Why are you doing all this (gun reform) and yet you\u2019re fighting it over here?\u2019\u201d said Juan \u201cGunny\u201d Macias, a survivor who was shot numerous times in the attack and viewed the president\u2019s gun safety priorities as dissonant with the potential Justice Department appeal.\n\nIn July 2021, the government was found liable for failing to provide records that could have kept Devin Kelley from acquiring the weapon he used in the shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, and it was ordered to pay the more than 80 survivors and victim family members $230 million dollars. The Justice Department has received two extensions to file its appeal brief, now due next week, and is unlikely to receive another one.\n\nInvestigators at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on Nov. 6, 2017. Jay Janner / Austin American-Statesman via AP file\n\nThe Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment, but it argued in court that if the U.S. Air Force had followed the law and the shooter was not allowed to purchase a firearm, he could have found a gun another way and committed the same act, according to court transcripts.\n\nThough it is required by federal law, the Air Force did not report the gunman's 2012 arrest and court-martial for domestic violence to the FBI. If the military branch had reported his court-martial, it would have appeared on a background check and the former airman, who died by suicide after carrying out the mass shooting, would have been prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms and ammunition.\n\nIt also did not warn others of a pattern of behavior that led to him being banned from all U.S. military bases. The Air Force was aware of death threats he made against his family, military security forces, police officers and members of his squadron, court records show.\n\nMacias, a retired Marine, was extensively injured in the shooting. He broke down in tears as he described dealing with regular hernias, lead poisoning from the bullets and the colostomy bag he now must wear that often leaks or falls off, making it difficult to travel in public and ruining \u201csimple pleasures like sitting to eat.\u201d\n\nJuan \u201cGunny\u201d Macias, a survivor, was shot numerous times in the attack. Courtesy National Trial Law\n\nHis voice betrayed a deep sense of anger when he discussed the appeal that involves more than 80 survivors and victims' family members, and the government\u2019s failure to report the gunman\u2019s violent past.\n\n\u201cThe law is there for a reason,\u201d Macias said. \u201cAnd if they would\u2019ve followed that law, if they would have done their job, this would have never happened. Twenty-six people would be alive today.\u201d\n\nJamal Alsaffar, an attorney for the victims, said that the Justice Department had backed out of mediation over the case, and he is preparing for a potential appeal that he believed could damage gun safety laws. It would also put his clients through many more months of reliving the traumatic shooting, he said.\n\n\u201cThe gun lobby can\u2019t wait until they file this appeal because then they\u2019ll say, \u2018Look, even the Biden (Department of Justice) says they don\u2019t have to follow background check laws because they don\u2019t really work,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nThe intentions of the government\u2019s lawyers may be to point out that the nation's gun control measures are fairly limited and that there are many loopholes that can be taken advantage of, said Robert Spitzer, a political science professor at the State University of New York College at Cortland, who has authored six books on gun policy. Nevertheless, gun rights supporters would likely celebrate the Justice Department\u2019s success in the case, he added.\n\nAs the Justice Department\u2019s \u201clawyers are brought in to be good lawyers, not to be good Democrats or Republicans,\u201d he said, they are likely trying to win at all costs without fully considering the political ramifications or how it will affect victims.\n\n\u201cI assume the Justice Department is taking this position because the lawyers are looking for the best legal avenues that will give them the outcome they want,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, sometimes, a good legal strategy is a poor political strategy, and this might be an example of that.\u201d\n\nHailey McNulty, who survived the shooting as a 15-year-old, seemed to think that might be the case. She was shot five times and recovered, but continues to be physically and emotionally affected after the shooting. Her mother who pushed her under a pew and attempted to protect her was shot in the head and died inches from her during the attack.\n\n\u201cI was so scared and nervous and I rolled over to try to get the attention of my mom to talk to her, and she wasn\u2019t responding,\u201d she recalled, later breaking down in tears as her grandmother spoke about taking her to the hospital. \u201cAnd then it clicked to me that she was dead.\u201d\n\nHailey McNulty at her mother Tara's grave. Her mother who pushed her under a pew and attempted to protect her was shot in the head and died inches from her during the attack. Courtesy Haily McNulty\n\nMcNulty argued that the Justice Department was cynically subverting background checks to win in court, which did not square with the Biden administration\u2019s policy efforts to protect people from gun violence.\n\n\u201cHow do they expect the citizens of the United States to abide by these laws when they see that the ones in charge don\u2019t even have to listen or abide by them themselves?\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what creates chaos. That\u2019s what creates problems like the ones we\u2019re facing.\u201d\n\nFor fear of what an appeal could mean for U.S. gun laws, a coalition of 37 gun safety organizations sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland in October about the Justice Department\u2019s intention to appeal. In the letter, they state that the federal government\u2019s \u201crefusal to accept responsibility for its failure in this case actively undermines the very gun safety laws it is required to enforce\u201d and \u201cabandons the Government\u2019s promise to keep communities safe by preventing prohibited persons from purchasing firearms.\u201d\n\nExpanded background checks and red flag laws were a cornerstone of Biden\u2019s landmark gun control legislation that passed this year after the Uvalde shooting in Texas, in which 19 elementary school students and two teachers were killed.\n\nThe White House said it could not comment on pending litigation, but it emphasized that Biden\u2019s \u201ccommitment to reducing gun violence could not be clearer.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Biden has championed stronger gun safety laws for decades, from helping to establish the gun background check system and passing an assault weapons ban during his time in the Senate, to signing the strongest gun safety legislation in 30 years at the White House this past summer,\u201d said Olivia Dalton, the White House deputy press secretary, adding that Biden intended to \u201ctake additional action to end the scourge of gun violence in America.\u201d\n\nBut those intentions mean little to McNulty, especially as the potential for an appeal no longer looms so far in the distance.\n\nWhile the government can argue that gunman could have procured the firearm elsewhere, \u201cthe problem is that he didn\u2019t have to go to extensive lengths to find the weapons he wanted,\u201d she said. \u201cHe literally walked into the store and bought them just like anybody else.\u201d", "label": "human"}
{"text": "NEW YORK (AP) - Black homeowners have been driven out of a block in Baltimore as Wall Street banks fail to deliver on loan commitments, Bloomberg's investigation shows. A report released last week found that banks had pledged $7 million in investments and loans to a historically black community north of Mosaic, Bar. The funds were intended to help rebuild and stabilize properties that have been neglected and abandoned since the civil rights era. \"It should be a model community, but instead it's one of the most painful neighborhoods in Baltimore,\" said Carla Feltz, a historian and community advocate who has long monitored the region's changing demographics. The Bloomberg report found that J.P. Morgan, Deutsche Bank, Wells Fargo and Bank of America were among the big Wall Street banks that failed to deliver on investment, loans, and renovation promises. They all pledged $7 million from their Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) fund aimed at \"stabilizing and revitalizing\" low-income and minority communities. The CRA funds are managed through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which oversees banks and supervises the funds they must reinvest in the communities they serve. However, the FDIC rarely audits banks to ensure that they meet the requirements of the CRA. The lack of funding has had a devastating impact on the people of Bonaparte Avenue, with many homes neglected and in disrepair. According to Bloomberg, only nine houses are currently occupied in the neighborhood, leaving the rest either abandoned or in poor condition. \"It's the face of inequality, it's a harsh reminder that even when big companies promise to invest in black communities, those promises are often empty,\" said Feltz. \"It's very important for banks and other institutions to be held accountable for their commitments because without accountability there can be no real change.\" A study by PolicyLink found that one in five people living in low-income and minority communities still live in areas with little or no investment. These communities are often left behind, without access to quality education, health care, or employment opportunities. \"The tragedy of the residents of Bonaparte Avenue is a symbol of inequality and economic injustice that still plagues America today,\" said John S. Weekes, lead author of the Bloomberg report. \"It is critical that banks and other institutions be held accountable for their commitments and invest in supporting and revitalizing low-income and minority communities.\" After the Bloomberg investigation, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo have agreed to invest an additional $20 million in investments and loans in the region. These funds will be used for renovations, infrastructure improvements, and job creation. \"An increase of $20 million is a critical step, but it's only the beginning,\" Weaves said. \"Banks, governments and community organizations must take meaningful action to ensure that everyone has access to safe and secure housing, quality education, and good jobs.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Digital health, or the well-known \"health care technology\" in the industry, has become one of the most noteworthy investment areas for venture capital firms in recent years. These companies, which develop everything from apps that monitor patient health data to platforms that provide mental health services, have been able to attract the attention of some of Silicon Valley's most prestigious investors and others. But a veteran investor, Aike Ho, predicts that investors will soon begin to understand the trend and stop rewarding \"digital healthcare startups pretending to be tech companies,\" as he says. Ho Chi Minh, who has more than 10 years of venture capital experience, said investors should carefully study the long-term prospects of these digital health companies. While their current strategies may be attractive to investors, Ho Chi Minh says their products and services may not be sustainable in the long run. \"It's true that investment in digital health has surged in recent years,\" explains Ho, \"but investors are increasingly questioning whether these companies actually offer something of value in the long run. Many of them simply pretend to be tech companies and don't really deliver any lasting benefits to the healthcare industry.\" He explained that investors are increasingly questioning whether these companies can really stand the test of time and provide value to the healthcare industry in the long run. As more companies enter this field, competition for investor capital is becoming fierce. \"It's increasingly difficult for digital health startups to stand out and prove themselves to investors,\" says Ho. \"Investors are increasingly questioning whether these companies offer unique and sustainable products, not just short-term hype.\" Ho believes that investors will begin more critical research on digital healthcare startups in 2023. They will pay more attention to whether the technology offered is truly transformative, and whether it can scale up and bring long-term benefits to the healthcare industry. \"There are a lot of investors focused on the short-term potential of these digital health startups,\" he said, \"but investors will start to take a more cautious approach in 2023 and really consider the long-term potential of these companies.\" He predicts that digital healthcare startups will need to prove their value in 2023 if they are to continue to receive investor attention. Companies that can demonstrate the truly innovative and transformative nature of their technology and be able to scale across multiple health care markets will pay off. \"In 2023, investors will reward digital health companies that have the potential to make a significant impact on healthcare,\" He said. \"Those who can demonstrate that their technology can be used at scale and has a real impact in the healthcare industry will be rewarded.\" Ho believes that this shift in investor sentiment is a positive development in the field of digital health. This will ensure that the best companies get the resources they need to grow and succeed, while those who cannot demonstrate long-term sustainability will soon be eliminated. \"It's a natural step for investors to start paying more attention to the long-term potential of these companies,\" says Ho. \"The health tech industry must continue to thrive and make a real difference in the healthcare industry, and let investors get the returns they seek.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "This is the beginning of a new year, and many people want to make their money work for them by investing in it. But with so many choices and strategies out there, knowing where to start can be overwhelming. That's why Andrea Ruiz, a 30-year-old homemade millionaire, gave some advice. She started investing in her 20s and now has a diversified portfolio that allows her to live on her own terms. \"When I started investing, I didn't know where to start,\" she said, \"I spent a lot of time and energy getting the knowledge needed to make smart decisions.\" Fortunately, you don't have to be a master of finance to start investing.Ruiz says there are four basic principles that you should follow which will help you build a successful portfolio. 1.Understand your risk tolerance It is important to understand your risk tolerance before making any investment decision. Everyone has different risk tolerances, and it's important to consider how comfortable you are with different levels of risk. For example, some people may be willing to take more risks and invest in more speculative stocks. Others may prefer conservative portfolios with lower risk and lower returns. Once you've learned about risk tolerance, you can start looking for investments that match it. Diversify your portfolio In terms of investment, diversification is key. Ruiz recommends investing in different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, cash and real estate. This will help to spread your risk, so you don't put all the eggs in one basket.In addition, it can help you take advantage of different market cycles and opportunities. It is also important to diversify within each asset class. For example, if you invest in stocks, you may want to consider investing in different industries and sectors. This will help minimize your risk when an industry or sector is hit. 3. Setting achievable goals It is important to set realistic and achievable goals, which should be concrete, measurable and time-bound. For example, you might aim to increase your portfolio by 10% within a year. Or you might want to set a goal of saving a certain amount per month for retirement. These goals will give you some work and help you stay focused and motivated. 4) Don't forget about the long term. When investing, it's important to focus on the long term. Investment can be a good way to create wealth in the long run, but it can also fluctuate in the short term. It's important to remember that there will be ups and downs, and keep an eye on the long term. Investing is not a fast-growing plan, so don't expect overnight results. By following these four principles, you can build a successful and diverse portfolio in 2023. It's important to do your own research and understand the investments you make. But with the right strategy and a little patience, you can get along well on the road to building wealth.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": ".. Louisiana's latest law restricting access to porn comes into effect on January 1, 2020, requiring anyone who wants to watch adult videos to first submit a valid form of identification that proves they are at least 18 years old. The controversial law, signed in December 2019 by Governor John Bel Edwards, has been praised and criticized by citizens, legal experts, and state legislators. Proponents say the new law will protect children and young people from harmful content, while opponents see it as an unnecessary regulation that could have unexpected consequences. The new law requires all Louisiana residents who wish to watch porn videos online or in any store to show their age first to present a valid identity document.The law applies to porn videos or magazines and materials that depict sexual activity in any way, but does not apply to websites or bookstores that offer items such as romance novels, sex education books or health and hygiene products. Those who fail to provide valid identification may face fines of up to $500, as well as other potential costs. It is not clear whether a fine will be imposed on first-time offenders, or whether more severe penalties such as jail time will be imposed. The law also makes it illegal for individuals under the age of 18 to buy, rent, or otherwise own pornographic material. The new law is similar to the restrictions imposed by some other states and countries, such as the United Kingdom, where all pornography must be kept out of sight. Louisiana's laws also follow the country's long-standing regulations on pornographic materials, which have been banned since the 1960s. Some legal experts have raised concerns about potential constitutional issues that the law could raise, such as whether it would violate the First Amendment or impinge on an individual's right to privacy. Proponents of the law argue that the law does not violate any constitutional rights, but merely provides an additional layer of protection for children and young people who do not have the ability to make informed decisions when viewing potentially harmful content. At the same time, some opponents of the law have questioned its usefulness, arguing that individuals under the age of 18 can still easily access pornography online, and that the law is more burden than practical protection. Some have compared the law to the American era of alcohol prohibition, when laws banning the sale and consumption of alcohol had little effect on people's actual behavior. Ultimately, the outcome of this law remains to be seen. However, it is clear that Louisiana's implementation of this law has sparked an important debate about the need for regulation of pornography in an increasingly digital and open world.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "watch now\n\nBill Harris, former PayPal CEO and veteran entrepreneur, strode onto a Las Vegas stage in late October to declare that his latest startup would help solve Americans' broken relationship with their finances. \"People struggle with money,\" Harris told CNBC at the time. \"We're trying to bring money into the digital age, to redesign the experience so people can have better control over their money.\" related investing news 2022 didn\u2019t go as expected for bank investors. How to avoid pitfalls in the sector in 2023 But less than a month after the launch of Nirvana Money, which combined a digital bank account with a credit card, Harris abruptly shuttered the Miami-based company and laid off dozens of workers. Surging interest rates and a \"recessionary environment\" were to blame, he said. The reversal is a sign of more carnage to come for the fintech world. Many fintech companies \u2014 particularly those dealing directly with retail borrowers \u2014 will be forced to shut down or sell themselves next year as startups run out of funding, according to investors, founders and investment bankers. Others will accept funding at steep valuation haircuts or onerous terms, which extends the runway but comes with its own risks, they said. Top-tier startups that have three to four years of funding can ride out the storm, according to Point72 Ventures partner Pete Casella. Other private companies with a reasonable path to profitability will typically get funding from existing investors. The rest will begin to run out of money in 2023, he said. \"What ultimately happens is you get into a death spiral,\" Casella said. \"You can't get funded and all your best employees start jumping ship because their equity is underwater.\"\n\nThousands of startups were created after the 2008 financial crisis as investors plowed billions of dollars into private companies, encouraging founders to attempt to disrupt an entrenched and unpopular industry. In a low interest rate environment, investors sought yield beyond public companies, and traditional venture capitalists began competing with new arrivals from hedge funds, sovereign wealth and family offices.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe movement shifted into overdrive during the Covid pandemic as years of digital adoption happened in months and central banks flooded the world with money, making companies like Robinhood , Chime and Stripe familiar names with huge valuations. The frenzy peaked in 2021, when fintech companies raised more than $130 billion and minted more than 100 new unicorns, or companies with at least $1 billion in valuation. \"20% of all VC dollars went into fintech in 2021,\" said Stuart Sopp, founder and CEO of digital bank Current. \"You just can't put that much capital behind something in such a short time without crazy stuff happening.\"\n\nThe flood of money led to copycat companies getting funded anytime a successful niche was identified, from app-based checking accounts known as neobanks to buy now, pay later entrants. Companies relied on shaky metrics like user growth to raise money at eye-watering valuations, and investors who hesitated on a startup's round risked missing out as companies doubled and tripled in value within months. The thinking: Reel users in with a marketing blitz and then figure out how to make money from them later. \"We overfunded fintech, no question,\" said one founder-turned-VC who declined to be identified speaking candidly. \"We don't need 150 different neobanks, we don't need 10 different banking-as-a-service providers. And I've invested in both\" categories, he said.\n\nOne assumption\n\nThe first cracks began to appear in September 2021, when the shares of PayPal, Block and other public fintechs began a long decline. At their peak, the two companies were worth more than the vast majority of financial incumbents. PayPal's market capitalization was second only to that of JPMorgan Chase . The specter of higher interest rates and the end of a decade-plus-long era of cheap money was enough to deflate their stocks. Many private companies created in recent years, especially those lending money to consumers and small businesses, had one central assumption: low interest rates forever, according to TSVC partner Spencer Greene. That assumption met the Federal Reserve's most aggressive rate-hiking cycle in decades this year. \"Most fintechs have been losing money for their entire existence, but with the promise of 'We're going to pull it off and become profitable,'\" Greene said. \"That's the standard startup model; it was true for Tesla and Amazon . But many of them will never be profitable because they were based on faulty assumptions.\" Even companies that previously raised large amounts of money are struggling now if they are deemed unlikely to become profitable, said Greene. \"We saw a company that raised $20 million that couldn't even get a $300,000 bridge loan because their investors told them `We are no longer investing a dime.'\" Greene said. \"It was unbelievable.\"\n\nLayoffs, down rounds\n\nAll along the private company life cycle, from embryonic startups to pre-IPO companies, the market has reset lower by at least 30% to 50%, according to investors. That follows the decline in public company shares and a few notable private examples, like the 85% discount that Swedish fintech lender Klarna took in a July fundraising. Now, as the investment community exhibits a newfound discipline and \"tourist\" investors are flushed out, the emphasis is on companies that can demonstrate a clear path toward profitability. That is in addition to the previous requirements of high growth in a large addressable market and software-like gross margins, according to veteran fintech investment banker Tommaso Zanobini of Moelis . \"The real test is, does the company have a trajectory where their cash flow needs are shrinking that gets you there in six or nine months?\" Zanobini said. \"It's not, trust me, we'll be there in a year.\" As a result, startups are laying off workers and pulling back on marketing to extend their runway. Many founders are holding out hope that the funding environment improves next year, although that is looking increasingly unlikely.\n\nNeobanks under fire\n\nAs the economy slows further into an expected recession, companies that lend to consumers and small businesses will suffer significantly higher losses for the first time. Even profitable legacy players like Goldman Sachs couldn't stomach the losses required to create a scaled digital player, pulling back on its fintech ambitions. \"If loss ratios are increasing in a rate increasing environment on the industry side, it's really dangerous because your economics on loans can get really out of whack,\" said Justin Overdorff of Lightspeed Venture Partners. Now, investors and founders are playing a game of trying to determine who will survive the coming downturn. Direct-to-consumer fintechs are generally in the weakest position, several venture investors said. \"There's a high correlation between companies that had bad unit economics and consumer businesses that got very large and very famous,\" said Point72's Casella.\n\nMany of the country's neobanks \"are just not going to survive,\" said Pegah Ebrahimi, managing partner of FPV Ventures and a former Morgan Stanley executive. \"Everyone thought of them as new banks that would have tech multiples, but they are still banks at the end of the day.\" Beyond neobanks, most companies that raised money in 2020 and 2021 at nosebleed valuations of 20 to 50 times revenue are in a predicament, according to Oded Zehavi, CEO of Mesh Payments. Even if a company like that doubles revenue from its last round, it will likely have to raise fresh funds at a deep discount, which can be \"devastating\" for a startup, he said. \"The boom led to some really surreal investments with valuations that cannot be justified, maybe ever,\" Zehavi said. \"All of these companies across the world are going to struggle, and they will need to be acquired or shut down in 2023.\"\n\nAs in previous down cycles, however, there is opportunity. Stronger players will snap up weaker ones through acquisition and emerge from the downturn in a stronger position, where they will enjoy less competition and lower costs for talent and expenses, including marketing. \"The competitive landscape shifts the most during periods of fear, uncertainty and doubt,\" said Kelly Rodriques, CEO of Forge, a trading venue for private company stock. \"This is when the bold and the well capitalized will gain.\" While sellers of private shares have generally been willing to accept bigger valuation discounts as the year went on, the bid-ask spread is still too wide, with many buyers holding out for lower prices, Rodriques said. The logjam could break next year as sellers become more realistic about pricing, he said.\n\nBill Harris, co-founder and CEO of Personal Capital Source: Personal Capital.", "label": "human"}

REUTERS/Cesar Olmedo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASUNCION, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Paraguay would cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan and open relations with China if the opposition wins the election in April, its presidential candidate Efrain Alegre told Reuters, hoping to boost soy and beef exports that are its main economic engines.\n\nThe ruling party candidate, meanwhile, told Reuters he would maintain ties with Taiwan, a self-governed island that China considers one of its provinces and not a county, making the geopolitical question a center-piece of the election race.\n\nParaguay is one of only 14 nations globally that retains diplomatic ties with Taiwan and the only South American country to do so.

There are other small parties running in the single-round election.\n\nTaiwan's foreign ministry told Reuters that it was paying close attention to Paraguay's upcoming election and was seeking to strengthen ties with candidates on all sides.\n\n\"Our embassy is actively strengthening contact and communication with candidates from different political parties to win support for the Taiwan-Paraguay friendship,\" the ministry said in a statement.\n\nThe democratically-ruled island strongly rejects China's sovereignty claims, which have grown in recent years with Beijing ramping up diplomatic, military and economic pressure.\n\nChina says the island's allies remain with Taipei only due to pressure from Washington and so-called \"dollar diplomacy\".\n\nPRESSURE FROM FARMERS\n\nParaguay's Taiwan ties have been under the pressure in recent years, especially from the country's beef producers and farmers, who see the relationship as an obstacle to gaining access to the world's largest market for their products.\n\n\"We make a sacrifice for the political support given to Taiwan and on balance, we consider that we receive very little in compensation,\" Pedro Galli, president of the Rural Association of Paraguay (ARP), told Reuters.\n\nParaguayan imports from China totaled $4 billion in 2021, while exports stood at just $30 million. Paraguay had a trade surplus with Taiwan that year of $118 million.\n\nThe ARP, the country's largest cattle farming chamber, has been sounding out possible support for China among candidates since December primaries in a series of political meetings. Paraguay produces around 300,000 tonnes of beef a year.\n\n\"We will be measuring the temperature,\" added Galli.\n\nParaguay is a top 10 global beef exporter and the fourth largest soybean exporter, its main cash crop. Soybean production is about 10 million tonnes per year and with its derivatives, it generates more than $2 billion in foreign currency.\n\nHector Cristaldo, president of the Union of Production Guilds, the main soybean chamber, said the country was currently locked out of China, which he said made up some two-thirds of the global market.\n\n\"Today it is practically impossible to sell products to that huge market,\" he said.\n\n\"What we produce is enough for a neighborhood in a city in China, but what interests (Beijing) is us breaking ties with Taiwan. That is the dilemma that Paraguay has and that our authorities have to resolve.\"\n\n(This story has been refiled to remove alerts from the text)\n\nReporting by Daniela Desantis; Additional reporting by Sarah Wu; Editing by Adam Jourdan and Marguerita Choy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Dec 29 (Reuters) - The Securities Commission of the Bahamas said on Thursday that it is holding FTX assets worth $3.5 billion based on market pricing at the time of transfer on a temporary basis to deliver them to customers and creditors who own them.\n\nThe digital assets of FTX's Bahamas unit were transferred to digital wallets under the exclusive control of the commission in November soon after the company and its hedge fund Alameda Research and dozens of affiliates filed for U.S. bankruptcy.\n\nUpon completion of the transfer, FTX founders Sam Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang no longer had access to the tokens that were transferred or frozen, the executive director of the commission, Christina Rolle, said in an affidavit filed with the Bahamas Supreme Court.\n\n\"All transferred assets were and remain under the sole control of the commission,\" Rolle said.\n\nLawyers for crypto exchange FTX earlier this month opposed a demand for internal records from its Bahamian business, saying they \"do not trust\" the Bahamian government with data that could be used to siphon off assets from the bankrupt company.\n\nThe authorities in the Bahamas, where the company had its headquarters, appointed liquidators to wind down FTX's international trading business soon after the company announced bankruptcy.\n\nThe sheer size of the asset seizure sends mixed signals to FTX customers, according to Deborah Kovsky-Apap, a bankruptcy attorney who is not involved in the case.

{"text": "See Full Image Gallery >>\n\n\n\nPros: Exceptional powertrains, including the hybrid and Lightning; unique and game-changing tech; well-balanced driving dynamics; Raptor!\n\nCons: Interior design is a bit ugly; the Ram rides better\n\nAs you can see from the rather \u201cyeah, so what?\u201d collection of cons above, it\u2019s safe to say that we think that buying a 2023 Ford F-150 would be a decent idea. We might prefer driving the Ram 1500 or sitting in the Chevy Silverado\u2019s stylish new interior, but when it comes to those things that make a truck a truck, the F-150 is quite simply exceptional.\n\nIt really comes down to two big-ticket areas: engines and technology. First, its smooth and efficient turbocharged V6 \u201cEcoBoost\u201d engines provide impressive refinement and power that makes anything with a V8 feel a bit old fashioned. Of course, the PowerBoost Hybrid puts even those to shame with the sort of no-compromise combo of power and efficiency that can really only be beat by the also-exceptional F-150 Lightning electric truck we review separately.\n\nSecond, when we talk about \u201ctechnology\u201d we\u2019re not talking about the usual discussion of touchscreens and Apple CarPlay. Nope, the F-150 has game-changing tech for actual truck purposes. We named its Pro Power on-board generator options our Technology of the Year for 2021, and then its Onboard Scales and Smart Hitch hauling and towing features our Technology of the Year for 2022. We describe them at the above links and below.\n\nFor everything else that makes a truck a truck, including a variety of off-roading options topped off by the wild new Raptor R, the F-150 delivers. Try out the Ram and GM trucks to be sure, but definitely don\u2019t ignore this Ford.\n\nInterior & Technology | Passenger & Cargo Space | Performance & Fuel Economy\n\nWhat it's like to drive | Pricing & Trim Levels | Crash Ratings & Safety Features\n\nWhat's new for 2023?\n\nBesides massively jacked up prices, there\u2019s another pair of off-road-oriented F-150 models for 2023. First, there\u2019s the Rattler, a package that adds to the base XL trim level a variety of FX4 package upgrades: skid plates, all-terrain tires, off-road shocks, a locking diff and hill descent control. Outside you can tell it apart from the unique combination of XL black plastic grille and bumpers paired with special badging and the rugged wheel/tire combo. Second, there\u2019s the Raptor R, which adds a supercharged V8 to more or less the same Raptor chassis upgrades. You can read all about it in our Raptor R first drive review. There\u2019s also the F-150 Heritage Edition that pays tribute to the marque\u2019s history of distinctive two-tone color schemes. They\u2019re pretty snazzy.\n\nStory continues\n\n2022 Ford F-150 Platinum Interior\n\nWhat are the F-150 interior and in-car technology like?\n\nFord performed major surgery on the F-150's dash two years ago in order to swallow what is essentially a small television in top trim levels. The result is an awfully monolithic center stack that's less visually appealing than what you'd get in the Ram 1500 and radically revised Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra. That's especially true when talking about the upper trim levels, but at least those including the Platinum (pictured top) make up for it with buttery leather, open-pore wood trim and nicely textured metal-look trim. That said, even the lower XLT trim has high-quality materials and the novel inclusion of a trim piece embossed with a map of Detroit (pictured below, bottom left)\n\nAs for that big 12-inch screen, we can't say it adds much to the Sync 4 interface beyond simply being bigger than the 8-inch standard unit. That's certainly still a benefit (who wants a smaller screen?), but unlike the Ram portrait-style upgrade and GM\u2019s widescreen unit (plus the Lightning\u2019s portrait-style Sync 4A screen), the larger screen doesn't maximize its extra acreage with rearranged or extra-large icons that greatly improve functionality. It's also a further reach than what you'll find in the Ram, regardless of screen size. On the other hand, the available all-digital instrument panel is colorful and crisp, and there's no faulting the ample infotainment feature content.\n\nWe extensively reviewed the six-passenger cabin of a F-250 SuperCrew whose seating is essentially shared with the '22 F-150, including its front middle seat and fold-down console. Five-passenger F-150s, meanwhile, offer a center console with a unique armrest lid that unfolds forward to become a flat surface to place a laptop, paperwork or road-side picnic. To make this origami possible, the shifter uniquely motors forward into a recess, though only when parked (pictured below). We're curious to know how much owners have actually utilized and appreciated this functionality. Ford also greatly increased the steering wheel's tilt and telescoping travel, making for an impressively more comfortable, SUV-like driving position.\n\nHow big is the F-150?\n\nThe various full-size trucks are so big that differences among them are effectively moot. An inch or two here and there won't make a difference outside. As before, you get a choice of regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew cabs with the latter two offering six-passenger or five-passenger seating arrangements. The SuperCab continues to have clamshell doors rather than the front-hinged ones offered by Ram and GM. Its back seat space continues to be on the cramped side, but that's common for the segment. So too is the vast amount of rear seat space in the SuperCrew.\n\nThis is also as good a place as any to mention the F-150's unique bed elements. One is familiar: the tailgate's pop-out assist step that makes repeatedly climbing up and down out of the bed a game-changing quick-and-easy process (pictured above right). The second is a more recent advancement: the ProPower On Board electrical system that allows the F-150 to function as mobile generator and power station. A 2.0-kilowatt system is optional with the 2.7-, 5.0- and 3.5-liter gas engines, while the Power Boost hybrid offers a choice of standard 2.4-kW or optional 7.2-kW outputs. The lower-powered systems have a pair of 120-volt 20-amp outlets (pictured below left), while the 7.2-kW system adds two more 120-volt outlets plus a 240-volt 30-amp outlet (pictured below right). And finally, the third is the available Onboard Scales and Smart Hitch that make hauling and towing so much easier and safer.\n\nWhat are the F-150 fuel economy and performance specs?\n\nSettle in, folks, this is going to take a while. The F-150 is back up to seven engine options \u2013 the diesel engine from a few years back may still be gone, but the Raptor R adds a supercharged V8. Oh, and we\u2019re not even counting the Lightning, which we review separately.\n\nEvery F-150 has a 10-speed automatic and most come standard with rear-wheel drive. The basic four-wheel-drive system has an open diff at the rear, while the upgrade one has an electronic locking rear diff.\n\nThe lineup starts with a 3.3-liter naturally aspirated V6 good for 290 horsepower and 265 pound-feet of torque. Fuel economy is a 21 mpg combined with rear-wheel drive, and 20 mpg combined with four-wheel-drive.\n\nNext up is the first of two \"EcoBoost\" engines, which is just fancy Ford talk for \"turbocharged.\" The 2.7-liter twin-turbo V6 produces 325 hp and 400 lb-ft of torque, while returning 21 or 22 mpg combined depending on different factors. Don't be surprised if your real-world fuel economy is much lower than that, however.\n\nThere's still a good-old V8 available: Ford's 5.0-liter \"Coyote\" good for 400 hp and 410 lb-ft. Despite its output and cylinder count, it still manages between 18 and 20 mpg combined in regular models, or 17 mpg with the Tremor. Not bad.\n\nWe'd still choose the silky-smooth 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6, though, which pumps out 400 hp and 500 lb-ft of torque. Fuel economy is between 19 and 21 mpg combined depending on drivetrain in regular models, or 18 with the Tremor\n\nThe Ford Raptor, meanwhile, now offers a choice in engine. The \u201cbase\u201d choice is a upgraded version of that 3.5-liter EcoBoost good for 450 hp and 510 lb-ft. Fuel economy stands at 15 or 16 mpg combined depending on equipment. The new Raptor R boasts a supercharged 5.2-liter V8 from the Mustang Shelby GT500. It produces 700 hp and 640 lb-ft of torque. Fuel economy is only 12 mpg combined, which is just as terrible as the Ram TRX, but hey, it swills regular versus premium so it\u2019ll save you something like $1,000 every year in gas. Value!\n\nOf course, if you\u2019re really interested in saving gas, there's the sensational PowerBoost hybrid powertrain. Its combination of 3.5-liter twin-turbo V6 and electric motor integrated into the transmission produces 430 hp and 570 lb-ft. It returns 25 mpg with 2WD and 23 mpg with 4WD. That difference may not seem great, but when talking trucks, small differences in MPG figures can actually equate into big savings. In general, though, every version of the 2023 F-150 is impressively efficient for a full-size truck. Well, except the Raptor R.\n\n\n\nSee Full Image Gallery >>\n\nWhat's the F-150 like to drive?\n\nThere are so many versions of the F-150, especially in regard to engine choice, that how it drives very much depends. All share one common element: they are shockingly smooth, refined and even responsive to drive. A Platinum test truck and its adaptive steering system was almost SUV-like in the way it moved down the road: the steering was quicker and more responsive than before, the ride smoother, and there was the general feeling of the truck being smaller than it was. The refinement drop off to a much cheaper XLT test truck wasn't that big, either. For those who need a pickup that can also accommodate the whole family on a road trip, the F-150 is no longer the compromise it once was. The Ram 1500 pulls off a similar trick, and indeed, the gap between the two trucks has narrowed substantially \u2013 and has possibly disappeared.\n\nAs for those powertrains, we won't mince words: The F-150 PowerBoost is the most impressive pickup for everyday duty we've tested. Its massive output, refined power delivery and superior fuel economy make it the most appealing powertrain option. It also hides its hybridness well \u2013 there's no fussy CVT, awkward brake feel or weird electric noises. It feels totally normal. It also makes the otherwise potent 5.0-liter V8 feel like an old dog, especially in its responsiveness around town. The two EcoBoost turbocharged V6's are better in this regard, and continue to impress with their buttery smooth power delivery. The bigger 3.5-liter's substantial output is even more impressive in light of how relatively fuel efficient it remains.\n\nNote that we review the F-150 Lightning separately.\n\nWhat other Ford F-150 reviews can I read?\n\nWe drive as many variations of the new F-150 as we can, but come away most impressed by the PowerBoost hybrid.\n\n2021 F-150 Limited PowerBoost\n\nWe dispatched engineer and off-road expert Dan Edmunds to the California desert to give us the fullest look at the new Raptor you'll be able to find.\n\nDetailing what adding a supercharged Shelby V8 does to the Raptor (it does not make it slow)\n\nDetails about the off-road-oriented Tremor. It's more a slow-and-steady rock crawler than the Raptor.\n\nRead our detailed review of the Lightning, which is the wildly impressive electric F-150.\n\n\n\nSee Full Image Gallery >>\n\nJoin Editor Byron Hurd for a video tour of the F-150's new interior features.\n\nFord didn't draw attention to them, but there are many subtle-but-significant changes.\n\nWhat is the 2023 F-150 price?\n\nPrices are up significantly throughout the F-150 lineup, but the amount differs by trim level. The Lariat has gone up by nearly $8,000, while the XLT and Platinum are only about $1,500 more. Most others are closer to the higher end of that range. All prices below include the hefty destination charge of $1,895.\n\nAll prices below are the cheapest price each trim level is available. You can find a more comprehensive rundown of each trim level, including added standard features and the prices of various cab, bed and drivetrain combinations here at Autoblog.\n\nXL: $36,490\n\nXLT: $42,655\n\nLariat: $59,375\n\nTremor: $63,005 (pictured below left)\n\nKing Ranch: $64,900\n\nPlatinum: $66,590\n\nRaptor: $78,670\n\nLimited: $84,910 (pictured below right)\n\nRaptor R: $109,245\n\n2021 F-150 Limited PowerBoost\n\nWhat are the F-150 safety ratings and driver assistance features?\n\nThe base XL may not come standard with any driver assist systems, but in general, they are more widely available on the F-150 than on GM or Ram's trucks. Starting with the XLT, the F-150 comes standard with forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane keeping assist, blind-spot and rear cross-traffic warning and rear parking sensors. It's also eligible, depending on package or trim level, for the Co-Pilot360 Assist system that adds adaptive cruise control (ACC) with stop-and-go capability, lane-centering steering assist, evasive steering system and speed-sign recognition. The Blue Cruise advanced handsfree driving system can be added to all but the XL and XLT. The standard rearview camera also includes Dynamic Hitch Assist, which provides a sight line to help you hitch up without a spotter (or punching a hole in the bumper).\n\nIn government crash tests, every cab style received a perfect five stars for overall, frontal and side crash protection. Insurance Institute for Highway Safety named it a Top Safety Pick for its performance in all relative crash tests and for its crash-prevention technologies. Its headlight ratings were rated Poor, Acceptable and Good depending on trim level and equipment.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nYou Might Also Like", "label": "human"}

{"text": "A new report shows that demand for rural housing in the UK has declined after the coronavirus pandemic. Surveys from the National Building Association show that as prices continue to rise, demand for rural housing has declined in all parts of the UK. The report found that in the nine months ending December 2020, demand for rural housing declined compared to the previous year. West Midlands and Yorkshire were the most affected areas, with a decline of 18%. In contrast, London, South West and East England saw growth of 6% and 9%, respectively. Nationwide, the decline in demand may be due to economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic and a result of people reassessing their spending priorities. \"The COVID-19 pandemic has changed where people want to live,\" said Nick Durrant, director of Nationalwide Mortgages, in a statement. He added that people are also becoming more concerned about their finances and what they can afford. \"With mortgage rates at historically low levels, people are looking closely at their budgets to see where they can free up some cash,\" Durrant said. The report also shows that the average price of rural housing rose by 8.8% to PS268,000 in the nine months ending December. In contrast, urban home prices increased by only 4.1%. National reports indicate that the decline in demand is due to a significant increase in the number of people working from home as a result of the pandemic. \"Many people find that they can work just as effectively outside the office,\" Durant said, \"which gives them the freedom to move to more rural areas.\" The report also notes that people have been rethinking their finances in the wake of the pandemic and are looking for more affordable locations. \"The epidemic has caused many people to think twice about how to spend money,\" Durant said, \"and this has prompted some to look for more affordable housing, and rural real estate may be seen as a more cost-effective option than urban living.\" However, the report also warns that as the economic impact of the epidemic begins to subside, demand for rural housing may resume next year. \"As the economy recovers, people may be more confident about their job security and we may start to see an increase in demand,\" Durant said. He added that while demand for rural housing may remain low in the short term, it is likely to pick up in the long run as the impact of the pandemic begins to subside. \"As people become more secure financially, we can see that rural life is becoming more and more attractive,\" Durant said.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Call to Select readers: Have you found a mistake on your credit report that's affected your credit score or not been able to get a credit card or secure a loan because of a poor credit score? Reach out to trina.paul@nbcuni.com to share your story. Terms apply to American Express benefits and offers. Visit americanexpress.com to learn more. Lenders use credit scores to determine a borrower's creditworthiness, or the likelihood they will be able to pay back their loan on time and in full. This three digit number between 300 to 850 is calculated based on the information in your credit report. Two scoring models \u2014 FICO and VantageScore \u2014 are the most widely used, although FICO tends to be the more popular choice among lenders. Whenever you apply for a line of credit, a lender will take a look at your credit score to decide whether to extend a loan to you and determine what terms are appropriate. Having a good credit score can end up saving you hundreds or even thousands of dollars since it also determines the interest rate you'll get on a mortgage or the APR you'll have on a new credit card. Below, Select takes a closer look at what having a credit score of 800 really means for consumers, and how it affects the types of credit you would have access to.\n\nSubscribe to the Select Newsletter! Our best selections in your inbox. Shopping recommendations that help upgrade your life, delivered weekly. Sign-up here.\n\nWhat it means to have a credit score of 800\n\nA credit score of 800 means you have an exceptional credit score, according to Experian. According to a report by FICO, only 23% of the scorable population has a credit score of 800 or above. FICO considers five factors in the calculation of your credit score: Payment history (35%) : Make sure your payments are made on time and in full\n\n: Make sure your payments are made on time and in full Amounts owed (30%) : Your credit utilization ratio \u2014 the ratio of the amount of credit you use to the amount you've been extended \u2014 should be low\n\n: Your credit utilization ratio \u2014 the ratio of the amount of credit you use to the amount you've been extended \u2014 should be low Length of credit history (15%) : You'll benefit from having a longer credit history\n\n: You'll benefit from having a longer credit history Credit mix (10%) : Aim to have several different types of credit, whether it's installment loans, credit cards or a mortgage\n\n: Aim to have several different types of credit, whether it's installment loans, credit cards or a mortgage New inquiries (10%): Don't apply for too many lines of credit in a short period of time If you have a credit score of 800, it probably means you have a long credit history, have been making payments on time and keep a low credit utilization ratio. All this information shows lenders that you're likely to make good on your loan. According to a 2021 survey conducted by LendingTree, nearly all people with credit scores of 800 or above made their payments on time and in full \u2014 they also tend to have a low average credit utilization ratio of 5.7% and have old active accounts, with the average being at least 27 years. That said, you don't necessarily need to have a perfect credit score in order to get favorable terms on loans or low APRs on credit cards, as only a very small percentage of people have a perfect credit score. A recent FICO report showed that in April 2019, just 1.6% of the U.S. scorable population had a FICO score of 850 \u2014 it's typically unnecessary to aim for a credit score above 800. Generally, the rule of thumb is you'll need to have a credit score above 760 in order to receive the best terms on loans and/or mortgages. In other words, having a credit score of 800 puts you within the top credit score range and will help you qualify for the best terms, whether it's for a mortgage or a personal loan.\n\nBest credit cards if your credit score is 800\n\nHaving a credit score of 800 gives you access to some of the best credit cards on the market, which typically have a lower APR, offer more rewards opportunities, include more perks and have better welcome bonuses. The Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card is a popular choice for consumers who want a credit card with a generous welcome bonus but don't need a luxury card. Chase Sapphire Preferred cardholders can earn 60,000 bonus points spending $4,000 within the first three months of account opening.

{"text": "It looks like there may be a new weight loss drug coming to market that could become the best-selling drug ever. The drug, called LIPO-6, has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is now available for those who want to lose weight. LIPO-6 is a prescription-only drug that can work by targeting body fat cells and breaking them down. This drug is believed to reduce the amount of fat stored in the body by up to 25%, making it an effective weight loss solution for many people. It turns out that this drug has been popular with many people, and many have achieved very positive results in weight loss. However, the drug has one drawback, because it is expensive and requires a doctor's prescription. In order for the drug to be effective, people need to take it for at least three months. During this time, the body needs to adapt to the drug, which can take time. Therefore, before starting treatment, it is important to make sure that they are ready and willing to commit to taking the drug for a long time. The drug is available in the United States, but it is currently only available on a limited basis. This means that it may not be as widely used as other weight loss drugs, but will likely be more widely used in the near future. Although the drug is expensive and not available to everyone, it turns out to be a successful and popular weight loss solution. This could make it one of the best-selling drugs ever made, and potentially lifesaving for many who are struggling to achieve their weight loss goals. In the past, people have relied on a variety of methods to lose weight, such as diet and exercise, but this method may not be suitable for everyone, and can be time-consuming and difficult to stick with. LIPO-6 could radically change the way people lose weight because it's a simpler, more effective solution. If widely used, it can help reduce the amount of money spent on diet and exercise programs as well as the time spent trying to follow them. The future of LIPO-6 looks bright, and it's likely to be the best-selling drug ever. However, there is another question that needs to be answered: Who can afford it?", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The huge $940 million lottery bonus is the latest in a series of record-breaking top prizes won this year. In March of this year, the millionaire's huge bonus reached an unprecedented $1.6 billion. The record prize was split by three winners - one from South Carolina, one from California and one from New Jersey - for $533 million. In July, a 23-year-old Wisconsin man won the $522 million Powerball trophy. On Tuesday night, an anonymous player in South Carolina won a $940 million Miga Millions bonus, the fourth-largest top prize in U.S. lottery history, behind only the record Powerball giant jackpot of 1.5 billion won in 2016 and this year's $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion Miga Millions bonus. The size of the latest Miga Millions award is impressive, thanks to the game's unique \"focusing\" mechanism. If no one wins a prize, the maximum bonus will be reset to $40 million. The winning numbers on Tuesday night's draw were 5,28,62,65,70 and the Mega Ball 5. It is not clear if anyone meets all six figures, which means a $940 million bonus share. The bonus payment option is estimated to have paid $940 million over 29 years, or a one-time cash option of $551.7 million. Most winners opt for a one-time payment. It is estimated that the total prize won on Tuesday night was $1.15 billion, including a second prize of up to $1 million for players who match five numbers but are not Mega Ball players. South Carolina was the first state to allow residents to buy lottery tickets online, a move seen as helping drive ticket sales and boost bonuses. The state's Lottery Commission says sales have been strong in recent years because box office revenue has exceeded the $500 million mark. More recently, it's not just massive headlines. Last month, a woman from Boise, Idaho, won a huge prize of $190 million. Although the odds of winning such a huge bonus are very low - one in every 302.5 million super millionaires and one in every 292.2 million Powerball players - some experts believe that certain strategies can help increase opportunities. One strategy is to choose a less popular number. Since the prize is shared with anyone who matches all six numbers, the more people choosing the same number, the fewer bonuses will be earned. No matter what number you choose, if you want to participate in the lottery, experts recommend that you always check your tickets to make sure you're playing the right game, setting a budget and buying it responsibly.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Most of us are familiar with the terms \"heat wave\", \"snowstorm\" and \"cyclone\", but over the years, the weather vocabulary has evolved to include more vague words such as \"cyclonic bomb\" and \"harb\". For those who live in areas affected by extreme weather, knowing the language is essential to staying safe. Below is a glossary of some new words and their meanings. Bomb Cyclone: The term is used to describe a system of low-pressure storms that suddenly form and rapidly strengthen. As the storm deepens and moves in warm waters, it develops into a \"bomb cyclone\", which is characterized by extreme winds and heavy rains. Hubbard: This is a dust storm that erupts from the Sahara Desert. The term comes from the Arabic word \"blow\". Habob occurs mainly in North Africa, but can also occur in the Southwest of the United States, blowing through huge clouds of grey. Dreyjo: It was a broad and lasting storm, made up of a series of strong and extensive straight wind blows. It could cover hundreds of miles, last for several hours, and cause damage afterward. Sudden floods: A sudden flood occurs within six hours of a storm or dam breaking down.Sudden floods can cause widespread damage, and it's important to understand where they might occur. Fire Tornado: Also known as a \"fire cyclone\", it is a fire cyclone formed when the wind accompanied by wildfires interacts with the warm air produced by flames. A fire tornado can reach speeds of up to 150 miles per hour and pose significant danger to firefighters. A sudden warming of the stratosphere: This is a phenomenon where temperatures in the low stratosphere (a few miles above the Earth's surface) suddenly jump as high as 50 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in just a few days. This can lead to changes in the jet stream, and ultimately change the weather patterns on Earth. Pineapple Express: This is a unique weather pattern, flowing from waters near Hawaii that transport warm tropical air to the west coast of North America. The pineapple express storm can cause heavy rain and floods in coastal areas. El Nino: This is a weather event that occurs in the waters of the Equatorial Pacific Ocean, which is significantly warmer than usual. El Nino is responsible for extreme weather patterns around the world, including flooding and prolonged droughts in some areas. Heatwaves: Temperatures are much higher than the region's average for long periods of unusually hot weather. If people do not carefully take precautions, heat waves can lead to heat-related diseases such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Wind and cold: It is the effect of air temperature and wind speed on the body, it is especially important to pay attention to when the temperature is below freezing point. The lower the tempest, the faster the body cools, which increases the risk of being overheated. If you live in an area affected by extreme weather, these and other meteorological terms are well understood. Understanding the term and being aware of the risks associated with certain conditions is key to staying safe during dangerous weather events.", "label": "machine"}

Expect to hand over your ID\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Lionel Bonaventure/AFP via Getty Images Lionel Bonaventure/AFP via Getty Images\n\nOn websites showcasing adult-only content, verifying your age by typing your birthdate and clicking \"Go\" is deemed a simple process. But in Louisiana, that's no longer the case.\n\nAs of Jan. 1, 2023, people in Louisiana will need to present proof of their age, such as a government-issued ID, to visit and view pornographic websites like Pornhub, YouPorn and Redtube.\n\nThe controversial law, known as Act 440, requires adult websites to screen their visitors using \"reasonable age verification.\" The new law applies to any websites whose content is at least 33.3% pornographic material that is \"harmful to minors,\" according to the bill signed last June. The law doesn't specify how the 33.3% would be calculated.\n\n\"Any commercial entity that knowingly and intentionally publishes or distributes material harmful to minors on the internet from a website that contains a substantial portion of such material shall be held liable if the entity fails to perform reasonable age verification methods to verify the age of individuals attempting to access the material,\" the bill states.\n\nLouisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards' office did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment on how those without a valid driver's license or other government-issued ID can access online porn in Louisiana.\n\nRepresentatives at Pornhub, YouPorn and Redtube did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment on Louisiana's new law.\n\nConcerns grow about online privacy with the new law\n\nAs with any form of online verification in which you enter sensitive data such as your driver's license information, address, phone number or Social Security number, concerns grow as to whether your information is fully protected against security breaches and hacks.\n\nAnd with Louisiana's new law, experts argue that the verification process could potentially come with serious privacy risks for users.\n\nJason Kelley, the associate director of digital strategy at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told NPR that it's reasonable for consumers to have concerns about their privacy when it comes to sharing private information with third parties \u2014 especially when there's no guarantee that the data won't be retained.\n\n\"There is the explicit intention in the law that verifiers and websites that are using age verification should not retain [your information],\" Kelley said.\n\n\"But users don't have a lot of guarantees that it will happen and the data will be removed or deleted and [won't be] shared or used in other ways,\" he added.\n\nThe new law aims to hold adult websites accountable\n\nRep. Laurie Schlegel, the bill's sponsor, emphasized in a tweet last week before the law went into effect that age verification is \"a must to protect children from the dangers of online pornography.\"\n\n\"Online pornography is extreme and graphic and only one click away from our children. This is not your daddy's Playboy,\" Schlegel tweeted, adding that the law is \"a first step\" in holding pornography companies accountable.\n\nLouisiana is the first U.S. state to implement age verification to view adult content online. Other states, such as California, have passed similar laws restricting minors' access.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Sen. Mike Lee of Utah introduced a bill last month that would similarly require age verification, but on a national level.

{"text": "The U.S. will make history on July 14, as the federal government announced plans to execute a transgender woman in an Indiana prison - which would be the first such event in the United States. The U.S. Department of Prisons has announced plans to execute Lisa Montgomery, who has been on death row since 2008 following her conviction last year for the murder of Bobbie Jo Stinnett in Missouri. The execution of Montgomery's death sentence is scheduled for July 14 at the Federal Correctional Service in Tallwater, Indiana. Montgomery's lawyers argued that Montgomery suffered from severe mental illness at the time of the murder, but a federal court rejected her appeal and her attorney now called on President Donald Trump to grant pardon. Montgomery's case highlights some important issues, including the intersection of gender identity and criminal justice. The execution of Montgomery, the only transgender woman known to be on death row in the United States, will mark a critical milestone in the history of our criminal justice system. At the heart of Montgomery's case is her gender identity, which was denied when she was young. Montgomery was assigned as a male at birth and named after Peter, but lived as a woman when she was a teenage girl. She was deprived of access to gender-identified health care and resources, and continued to experience gender bias and misidentification throughout her life. Montgomery's case has been accepted by activists calling for her life to be saved, who have cited her gender identity and mental illness as factors that should be considered when deciding whether or not to carry out the death penalty. In addition, Montgomery's lawyers argued that it would be unconstitutional to execute her due to the deterioration of her mental health. In response, the U.S. Supreme Court twice rejected her application for a moratorium on executions, but Montgomery's lawyers are now appealing an amnesty to President Trump. The debate over Montgomery's execution has sparked a national discussion about the death penalty and gender identity. The American Civil Liberties Union, which notes that transgender people have \"a unique vulnerability\" to the death penalty, calls for mitigation of Montgomery's sentencing. At a time when transgender rights are being attacked in the United States, Montgomery's case is a sad reminder that transgender people still face systematic discrimination. The implementation of Montegomery's plan to remain on death row for more than a decade will be an injustice felt across the country. Montgomery's imminent execution has raised concerns about the cruel and unusual punishment of transgender people in the United States, and there is an urgent need to act to ensure that her life is saved. The Montgomery story reveals the urgent need to reform our criminal justice system to ensure fairness and justice for all.", "label": "machine"}

This is a game that has been discussed for several months and could become one of the most exciting matches in recent memory. In recent years, Ohio State has been one of the top teams in the country, but there are questions about their ability to play against the real team. Buckeyes has not beaten a record-winning team this season, nor have they achieved success against teams such as Georgia, Alabama and Florida. Georgia has been one of the top teams in the country this season, and it has the ability to control the rhythm of the game through gymnastics. The Bulls have already beaten three record-winning teams in 2021, including two with 11-1 records. The Wolves have had strong results, but there are some questions about their ability to compete against the national elites. They haven't won a game against teams with this season's record of winning, and they've fought against teams like Ohio State University, Florida, and Alabama. The TCU is the last team to compete for a title.The Yellow Frog have had some success in the past, but they haven't been able to finish a full season this year.They lost to several teams that shouldn't be, and they struggled to find consistency in their offenses. The 2021-2022 college football season will be an exciting time. Ohio State University and Georgia are the top two teams in the nation, hoping to make a statement on December 30. Meanwhile, Michigan and TCU are seeking discussions to prove that they belong to the best team in the country.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Credit card interest rates reached record highs last year and there is still more to come in 2023, according to Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com.\n\nCredit card rates are now more than 19%, on average \u2014 an all-time high \u2014 after rising at the steepest annual pace ever, in step with the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes to combat inflation.\n\nAlong with the Fed's commitment to keep raising its benchmark until more progress is made, credit card annual percentage rates will keep climbing, as well.\n\nMore from Personal Finance:\n\n1 in 5 young adults have debt in collections, report finds\n\n63% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck\n\n'Risky behaviors' are causing credit scores to level off\n\nWith more rate hikes on the horizon, average credit card APRs could be as high as 20.5% by the end of the year, a new record, McBride said.\n\nSince most credit cards have a variable rate, there's a direct connection to the Fed's benchmark. As the federal funds rate rises, the prime rate does, too, and credit card rates follow suit.

{"text": "Illinois has an inadequate process for selling off land it no longer needs. It ought to do better.\n\nThe glaring shortcoming was demonstrated when the state unloaded the so-called Damen Silos at 29th Street and Damen Avenue for $6.52 million to MAT Limited Partnership, which is owned by asphalt manufacturer Michael Tadin Jr. MAT has not endeared itself to many of the residents living near its asphalt plant in McKinley Park.\n\nClearly, the 23-acre Damen property, which is right on the river, should have been part of a master plan focused on helping to redevelop the land along the Chicago River in a way most beneficial to city residents.\n\nVarious groups around the city have said they want park space, a bike path or both on the site, opponents of the sale say. And transforming the river from an old-time industrial waterway to an environmental asset for the public has long been a goal for advocates of the river. But none of that was taken into account.\n\nThe Illinois Department of Central Management Services said the state simply followed rules that said the land should be sold to the highest bidder. But Kate Eakin, vice president of the McKinley Park Development Council, told us the law requires only a sale at fair market value and it does not apply if the state is selling the land to another government, such as the city of Chicago.\n\nEditorials bug Editorials\n\nAt the very least, the state could have postponed the sale to give the city a chance to explore whether it wanted to take on the property. Opponents of the sale say the state closed its deal with MAT on Dec. 20 but didn\u2019t notify anyone until Dec. 23, when many city offices were closed either for the holidays or because of bad weather. That does not seem like the way a transparent government should operate.\n\nGenerally, accepting the highest bid makes sense. We understand there is a risk to letting state politicians feel free to sell off property without insisting on the highest return to taxpayers. And community groups that have called for a voice in other various projects have not always had a realistic understanding about what can be achieved.\n\nBut there are instances, such as in this case, in which the public benefit from a thoughtful reuse of the property would have been greater than simply getting some extra money tacked onto the sale price and having the property put back on the tax rolls.\n\nThat\u2019s why better rules are needed.\n\nIllinois residents deserve to know what will be the ultimate use of land the state is selling, said Gerald W. Adelmann, president & CEO of Openlands.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure the key stakeholders have opportunities before a sale to express their concerns,\u201d Adelmann said.\n\nAs it stands now, the state does not require any plan for a site before selling it, other than making sure no state agencies want it. The Damen site, with its historic grain silos, is one of the last remaining large plots along the Chicago River that could be used for the public.\n\nThe long-idle silos, which sit in a manufacturing district, evoke a time when Midwestern grain poured into the city and helped Chicago become the world\u2019s fastest-growing metropolis during the final decades of the 1800s. Neighbors fear any demolition of the silos might release pollutants, including asbestos, into the community.\n\nDone right, the site could be turned into a city jewel providing open space and recreation. But conservationists say no one, including the state, can produce the document in which the state notified the city of the pending sale.\n\nAs it is now, the disposition process the state follows for situations like this is in obvious need of improvement. The state, which works on behalf of the public, has to get it right next time.\n\nThe Sun-Times welcomes letters to the editor and op-eds. See our guidelines.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Amazon estimates a 30% chance of US recession in the next 6 months, internal analysis shows.\n\nThat's a more positive outlook than other estimates. Some have 100% odds of a recession in 2023.\n\nAmazon anticipates a soft landing for the US economy, according to the leaked analysis.\n\nMost economists, banks, and think-tanks expect a recession in 2023. A leaked internal document from Amazon suggests a brighter outlook, especially for the US economy.\n\nAccording to an internal macroeconomic analysis from November, obtained by Insider, the company sees a 30% chance of a US recession within the next 6 months. Based on recent data showing continued labor demand and wage increases, Amazon also anticipates a soft landing for the US economy, a term used to describe a slow-growth period that avoids a recession, the internal report said.\n\nThat's a stark contrast to many other forecasts. A Bloomberg Economics study from October said the US had a 100% chance of entering a recession within the next 12 months. A Federal Reserve staff report from November found an almost 50% odds of a US recession next year, while an October survey by the Wall Street Journal put the probability at 63%.\n\n\"The US economy, on the other hand, continues to send mixed signals and does not appear to be in a recession (yet),\" Amazon stated in its report. \"These dynamics are consistent with a soft-landing scenario (e.g. mild increase in the unemployment rate, slowdown in hiring and quits, little rise in job destruction) though the impact of continued tightening by the Federal Reserve will affect the labor market with a delay.\"\n\nThe 12-page report, put together by Amazon's science, economic, and finance teams, gives a rare look into the e-commerce giant's view of the economy. The company has more than 160 million Prime subscribers in the US who shop regularly. That's 62% of the population, according to Insider Intelligence estimates. This gives Amazon an unprecedented view of activity in the world's largest economy. Its relatively cheerful forecast suggests the US may avoid a major downturn, despite high inflation, steady interest-rate hikes, and sustained geopolitical tension.\n\nInsider asked multiple Amazon spokespeople for comment twice on Tuesday, ahead of publication. Roughly 48 hours later, after publication on December 22, one of the spokespeople provided the following statement: \"The document in question does not reflect the company's position on the economy and where it's headed. Our CFO Brian Olsavsky shared our thinking on our most recent earnings call, and our CEO shared his thoughts in a Dec. 6 interview at the Dealbook event. This document simply reflects the thoughts of some of our economists.\"\n\n'Partially shielded'\n\nAmazon sees a higher risk of a recession in other parts of the world. In the Euro Area and the UK, the odds are at 70% and the global economy is at 40%, the report said.\n\nYet, even if a recession were to come and unemployment rose, Amazon appears less concerned about the impact on its sales. The report said Amazon is \"partially shielded\" against a recession because nearly 60% of Amazon's revenue comes from wealthier customers who are \"less responsive to unemployment rate changes.\" Customers in lower-income brackets, who are more susceptible to unemployment, \"account for a small portion of overall sales,\" it added.\n\nBut given new Amazon customers who drive most of the sales growth come from lower-income areas, the report said \"a recession has the potential to impact this group's expenditure\" and the company's long-term expansion. It also cautioned that rising mortgage rates and a declining housing market could have \"spillover\" effects on household expenditures, including purchases of home goods, like furniture, home furnishings, and electronics.\n\nWhile US inflation jumped to a range of 7% to 9% this year, Amazon hasn't raised its product prices as much, the report note. In 2022, the price of products sold on Amazon climbed a little less than 6%, and that rate of increase is expected to drop below 3% in 2023, before turning negative in 2024, it said.\n\n'Downward revisions'\n\nAmazon, for its part, has significantly cut costs by shutting down multiple businesses and laying off tens of thousands of employees in recent months. In October, Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy told employees in an internal all-hands that the company would be more thoughtful about its spending going forward, as Insider previously reported.\n\n\"It's on a lot of people's minds, and of course, none of us know for sure what's gonna happen, but there are a lot of signs that point to this being a difficult and rough economy ahead of us,\" Jassy said.\n\nThe internal report from November said the US economic outlook for 2023 has \"worsened significantly\" and baseline forecasts now see growth falling below 1%. Similar downward forecasts are applied to other advanced economies, the report said, citing the October IMF World Economic Outlook for global growth that was the weakest since 2001.\n\nAll this could make it hard for Amazon to achieve growth and profitability at the same time. Historically, Amazon saw its profit margins shrink when its business grew, and vice versa, the report noted. In the current climate, where Amazon is looking to dramatically cut costs, growth could be hard to come by.\n\n\"There is a clear tradeoff between the interplay of profit seeking and growth, rendering it difficult to achieve both objectives simultaneously,\" the report said. \"As our pendulum swerves to cut costs in pursuit of higher profit margins, this may undermine our ability to grow at a faster pace in the near \u2014 or mid-term.\"\n\nDo you work at Amazon?

So if you\u2019re searching for something to watch when the cousins come over for Christmas dinner, consider these options below.\n\n(Note: I have excluded the obvious \u2013 like \u201cA Christmas Story Christmas\u201d or the new series \u201cThe Santa Clauses\u201d \u2013 because I shouldn\u2019t have to tell you that those are worth a try if you like the originals.)\n\nIf you liked \u201cBad Santa,\u201d try \u201cViolent Night\u201d\n\nDavid Harbour as a new version of a 'bad' Santa in this year's 'Violent Night.' Allen Fraser/Universal Pictures\n\nFor those in the mood for a Christmas movie not for the faint of heart, \u201cViolent Night\u201d features an ass-kicking Santa Claus who doesn\u2019t take any crap and fights off the bad guys with aplomb. While David Harbour\u2019s (\u201cStranger Things\u201d) Santa may not be as \u201cbad\u201d as Billy Bob Thornton\u2019s trash-talking Father Christmas in 2003\u2019s \u201cBad Santa,\u201d the pair could definitely drink each other under the table, each eschewing the smiley/cheesy vision of the character for something gleefully grittier.\n\nIf you liked \u201cElf\u201d or \u201cJust Friends,\u201d try \u201cSpirited\u201d\n\nRyan Reynolds and Will Ferrell in this year's 'Spirited.' Claire Folger/Apple\n\nIf for no other reason than to witness the union of two Hollywood greats, this year\u2019s \u201cSpirited\u201d is a safe and fun bet since it brings together Will Ferrell and Ryan Reynolds, who were featured in two of the most beloved and hilarious Christmas movies from earlier this century \u2013 Ferrell in 2003\u2019s \u201cElf\u201d and Reynolds in \u201cJust Friends\u201d from 2005. The new film is filled with song and dance built around a(nother) fresh take on the classic \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d tale, and it still manages to showcase Reynolds\u2019s trademark smart-aleck delivery as well as Ferrell\u2019s zaniness. The only thing that seems to be missing is Anna Faris\u2019s brilliant and sidesplitting pop star Samantha James from \u201cJust Friends.\u201d\n\nIf you like \u201cGremlins,\u201d try \u201cKrampus\u201d\n\nEmjay Anthony confronts 'Krampus,' from 2015. Steve Unwin/Universal/Legendary/Shutterstock\n\nIf you haven\u2019t quite met your horror quota after Halloween, 2015\u2019s \u201cKrampus\u201d will deliver and then some. Featuring a cast including Adam Scott, unofficial horror queen Toni Collette and the late character actress Conchata Ferrell, the movie riffs off of the Germanic folktale of Krampus, a shadowy pagan figure who comes to punish those who Santa Claus skips over. The movie is an atmospheric slow build, but once the homicidal gingerbread cookies attack, even those nostalgic and cuddly-ferocious Gremlins should run for cover.\n\nIf you liked \u201cA Christmas to Remember,\u201d try \u201cFalling For Christmas\u201d\n\n(L to R) Lindsay Lohan, Chord Overstreet, Olivia Perez and Bus Riley in this year's 'Falling For Christmas.' Scott Everett White/Netflix\n\nFor those who want to go \u201cOverboard\u201d on Hallmark-style holiday fare, Lindsay Lohan has come to the rescue on Netflix this year, bringing viewers the amnesia-themed \u201cFalling For Christmas,\u201d which feels startlingly similar to the 2016 movie \u201cA Christmas to Remember\u201d starring Mira Sorvino. In both, a mishap befalls a privileged and pretty young woman, who learns about life lessons and the spirit of Christmas from a flannel-wearing hunk in a small town. The major beats are there, and nothing else much matters apart from LiLo\u2019s doe-eyed cuteness and killer holiday fashion.\n\nIf you liked \u201cThe Family Stone,\u201d try \u201cLast Christmas\u201d\n\nEmilia Clarke and Henry Golding in 2019's 'Last Christmas.' Universal Pictures\n\nWho doesn\u2019t love a tearjerker around the holidays? \u201cThe Family Stone\u201d from 2005 is a warm and charming family Christmas movie that builds to a heartbreaking climax, one that you can see coming in the more recent \u201cLast Christmas\u201d from 2019, which features Emilia Clarke as a free spirit who crosses paths with prim and proper Henry Golding. While it might be just a touch more heavy on the heartstrings, \u201cLast Christmas\u201d also stars Emma Thompson (who co-wrote the script) and this year\u2019s awards darling Michelle Yeoh of \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once.\u201d Plus, it features music from the late and great George Michael (the title of the movie is not an accident).\n\nIf you liked \u201cDie Hard,\u201d try \u201cThe Tower\u201d\n\n'The Tower,' featuring Son Ye-jin (left), CJ Entertainment/Everett Collection\n\n\u201cDie Hard\u201d is everyone\u2019s favorite alternative knock \u2018em, sock \u2018em Christmas action movie that earns its spot in the category only because it just so happens to take place during a highrise Christmas party. And while Korean movie \u201cThe Tower\u201d from 2012 doesn\u2019t include snooty hijackers like the dearly departed Alan Rickman, the story about a luxury skyscraper catching fire during a Christmas Eve party feels like the love child of \u201cDie Hard\u201d and \u201cThe Towering Inferno\u201d you didn\u2019t know you needed, providing a perfect viewing opportunity for those in the mood for more daunting and death-defying antics instead of snowflakes and mistletoe.\n\nIf you liked \u201cJingle All the Way,\u201d try \u201c8-Bit Christmas\u201d\n\n(L-R) Winslow Fegley and Steve Zahn in '8-Bit Christmas' from 2021. Sabrina Lantos/Warer Bros/Everett Collection\n\nLast year\u2019s \u201c8-Bit Christmas\u201d ramped up the nostalgia factor big time, with this endearing throwback tale centered around a young boy on a quest to receive the ultimate gift in the \u201980s \u2013 a Nintendo video game system. Much like \u201cJingle All the Way,\u201d which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger and is now solidly \u201890s-nostalgic, \u201c8-Bit Christmas\u201d hinges on the rabid fury that overtakes Christmas shoppers as they embark on their mission to procure the gifts they so desperately need (this also shows up, beautifully, in the opening credits of \u201cKrampus,\u201d above). What\u2019s more, \u201c8-Bit\u201d features Neil Patrick Harris of \u201cDoogie Howser\u201d fame \u2013 a walking piece of nostalgia himself. (\u201c8-Bit Christmas\u201d is available for streaming on HBO Max, which like CNN is part of the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.)\n\nIf you liked \u201cLove, Actually,\u201d try the Christmas episode from \u201cTed Lasso,\u201d \u201cCarol of the Bells\u201d\n\nJason Sudeikis and Hannah Waddingham in 'Ted Lasso.' Apple TV+\n\n\u201cLove, Actually\u201d enthusiasts are some of the most vocal Christmas movie fans of them all, and while nothing can totally capture the magic of that ensemble film (except, perhaps, the anniversary special on it that recently aired), Emmy-winning feel-good series \u201cTed Lasso\u201d came pretty close with the fourth episode from last year\u2019s second season, which is arguably the best entry from the show to date. Between Roy and Keeley\u2019s bonkers quest to freshen the breath of a little girl to Rebecca\u2019s lovely gesture towards Ted, the episode is winsome, warm, sweet, and unmistakably British \u2013 just like Hugh Grant.", "label": "human"}

In 2007, Graham joined the Alice tribute band called \"The King of Las Vegas\", a huge breakthrough. She had a direct impact on their performances and fans, who often sang her name in shows. Since then, Graham has become a celebrity and performs in front of hundreds of people every time she takes to the stage. She often wears full white jumpers and rhino-shaped belts and hair for her shows, but she also plays in blue soda shoes or pink and black hats. In addition to performing with the Las Vegas Kings, she also debuted famous Elvis tribute artists Terry Mike Jeffrey and Chris MacDonald, and performed on stage with Aloha in Hawaii.

{"text": ".. The Covid-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented surge in online shopping, with more consumers choosing to stay home and shop online rather than venture into shopping malls. Moreover, the holiday season is likely to be longer than ever, and many investors are looking to cash in on this trend by investing in retail ETFs. For those who are not familiar with the Exchange Trading Fund (ETF), it is a type of fund traded on a stock exchange, just like stocks. The ETF consists of a basket of assets that can include stocks, bonds and commodities. The retail sector is one of the most popular ETFs because it provides exposure to various companies within the industry. The Consumer Free Choice Unit, the SPDR Fund (XLY), is at the top of the list of investors seeking to reach out to the retail industry. The ETF tracks the performance of consumer free choice sector indices for 87 companies including Amazon, Home Depot and McDonald's. According to Morningstar, the ETF has grown by 35.6% over the past year with a return rate of 8.9% in the last three months. Another popular choice for investors is the VanEck Vector Retail ETF (RTH), which tracks the performance of the MVIS Global Retail Index, which consists of 33 global retail stocks. Over the past year, ETFs have returned 46.9% and 7.6% in the last three months. Invesco Dynamic Retail ETF (PMR) is a new ETF that is attracting investors' attention. The fund tracks the performance of the dynamic retail intelligence index, which includes 55 U.S. listed companies from the retail industry. Over the past year, ETFs have grown by 43.2% and 9.4% in the last three months. In addition to the ETFs mentioned above, investors can also opt for actively managed ETFs such as ProShares Online Retail ETF (ONLN), which tracks the performance of the ProShares online retail index consisting of 30 US listed online retail stocks. Over the past year, ETFs have risen by 56.3% and 8.9% in the last three months. First, unforeseen market risks such as economic recessions or company-specific issues can hurt ETF performance. Moreover, for those seeking a stable and conservative strategy, the volatility of retail stocks could make it a venture capital. Nevertheless, investors must understand the potential risks and returns of their investments before adding retail ETFs to a portfolio. ETFs can be a good way to engage with the retail industry, but investors need to be aware of the potential for volatility and risk. As the holiday season draws near, it's time for investors to assess their investment strategies and decide whether investing in retail ETFs is right for them.", "label": "machine"}

The missiles are designed to strike the mainland United States.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters that a ballistic missile had landed in waters west of the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. He said there were no reports of damage to vessels or planes in the area.\n\nA suspected ICBM was launched from the Soonan area in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, toward the country's eastern waters around 10:15 a.m. (8:15 p.m. Thursday ET), South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said.\n\nJapan's Ministry of Defense also said it appeared to be an ICBM-class ballistic missile.

{"text": "The name Jeffrey Dahmer makes most people feel sick and reminiscent of the terrible images of murder, torture, and degradation. The notorious American serial killer who was responsible for the murder and mutilation of 17 men and boys between 1978 and 1991 has become one of the most famous serial killers ever. Now, a new documentary series brings the public closer than ever to Dammer's life. Produced by Netflix and released on the streaming service on December 10, \"Monster: Jeffrey Dahmer\" is an in-depth exploration of the murderer's life, including interviews with people who knew him, footage from crime scenes, and observations of Darmer's twisted and terrible mind. Unsurprisingly, the series met with some repercussions. Critics see the film as a \"celebration\" of Dammer and his atrocities, which excited and romanticized his actions, risking killing people and glorifying violence. The filmmakers behind Monster: Jeffrey Dahmer defended their work, arguing that it was not a celebration of Damme, but an exploration of how to create such a monster. \"We are not celebrating Damme, we are exploring why Damme did what he did, which requires us to look at the environment, his family and other factors that could lead him down this terrible path.\" Some people worry that it might make Dammer's behavior fascinating, and make him a character of the \"super villain\" type. Others argue that using serial killer stories for entertainment is inappropriate, which seems to make his behavior normal and acceptable. While Netflix and the filmmakers may have good intentions, they risk using a very serious topic as well as the pain and suffering of Dammer's victims for entertainment. The documentary's producers say they want to explore why Dammer did what he did, and they are not trying to \"glorify\" him or make him a \"hero\", but it is difficult to know whether this information is lost in the shock and sensation that often appear in real crime documentaries. The release of Monsters: Jeffrey Dahmer comes at a time when true crime television is gaining popularity. While there's much to say about exploring crime and its causes, it's important to understand how these stories are presented and how they might be accepted. It's also important to consider the possibility that victims' families and entire communities may be affected by real crime stories. When cases like Dahmer are re-examined, it's difficult for a victim's family to relive their pain, and it's important to keep this in mind when making stories like Monster: Jeffrey Dammer. Real crime documentaries can be powerful tools for exploring crime and its causes, but it's important to realize how these stories affect society and those involved. It's crucial to consider how they might be accepted and whether they could have any negative impact. In Monster: Jeffrey Dahmer, filmmakers have the opportunity to explore a twisted and frightening case in an attempt to answer the question: Has television gone too far?", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Student loan borrowers still face a long road to find out if they will get federal debt cancellation after the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed its opening brief to the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday.\n\nIn it, the DOJ defended the legality of the Biden Administration\u2019s student loan forgiveness program announced in August, arguing the plan is clearly within the Education Security's authority under a 2003 act. It also argued that a second lawsuit brought by Missouri lacks standing.\n\nThe brief is the latest development in a legal fight that started in November and has left nearly 40 million student loan borrowers uncertain about the future of their finances.\n\n\"As the brief makes clear, the debt relief plan is not only lawful, it is critical to millions of working- and middle- class Americans who are otherwise at risk of falling behind as they work to recover from the pandemic,\u201d said Abby Shafroth, staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center and director of the Student Loan Borrowers Assistance Project. \u201cThe plan is designed to give people burdened by student debt breathing room as they recover from the pandemic, and to avoid a projected wave of student loan delinquencies and defaults when the pause on payments ends.\"\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 02: Student loan borrowers gathered at the Supreme Court today to tell the court that student loan relief is legal on January 02, 2023 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Larry French/Getty Images for We, The 45 Million)\n\n\u2018Legal authority\u2019\n\nIn November, the Education Department (ED) stopped taking applications for student loan forgiveness after a Texas federal district court judge ruled the program is a violation of legislative power and the St. Louis-based 8th Circuit Appellate Court imposed an injunction. Shortly after, the Biden Administration asked the U.S. Supreme Court to reinstate the program.\n\nThe brief this week addressed both of those cases.\n\nIn the Texas case, the DOJ argues that the HEROES Act expressly states that the Education Secretary has the authority to act in a national emergency \u2014 in this case, COVID-19 \u2014 to make sure borrowers are not left worse off with respect to their loans than they were before the emergency. According to the DOJ, the act allows the Secretary to move forward with the program without public comments.\n\nStory continues\n\nUS President Joe Biden and Department of Education Secretary Miguel Cardona. (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nThe brief also noted the act was used by both the Biden Administration and the Trump Administration when they paused federal student loan payments during the pandemic.\n\nIn the 8th Circuit case, the DOJ brief argues that the state of Missouri lacks standing to sue based on potential harm the forgiveness program may bring to the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority, or MOHELA, a loan servicer in the state. The DOJ argues that MOHELA is a separate entity from the state and harm to MOHELA is not harm to the state. Further, any claimed harm to MOHELA is based on multiple levels of speculation the Supreme Court has long rejected as a basis for standing.\n\n\u201cWe remain confident in our legal authority to adopt this program that will ensure the financial harms caused by the pandemic don\u2019t drive borrowers into delinquency and default,\u201d Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in a press release.\n\nLong road ahead still\n\nThe Biden Administration\u2019s brief, though, is only the start.\n\nThere will likely be more legal filings before the Supreme Court hears oral arguments in late February and renders an opinion. Opponents in the Texas and 8th Circuit cases have until Jan. 27 to submit their brief, and DOJ has until Feb. 15 to respond.\n\n\u201cThe arguments about the plaintiffs lacking legal standing seem strong. The arguments on the merits are somewhat weaker,\u201d Mark Kantrowski, author and student loan expert, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cDuring the hearings we may get a sense as to the direction the court will take based on the questions asked by the justices. A ruling could come as early as March or as late as June/July.\u201d\n\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.\n\nIn the meantime, borrowers should update their contact information with their loan servicer and on StudentAid.gov, and start saving an amount equal to their monthly payments to prepare for the restart of student loan repayment, Kantrowitz said.\n\nPresident Biden last month extended the payment pause on federal student loans until June 30, 2023. If litigation has not been resolved by then, payments will begin 60 days after that.\n\nFor borrowers who are worried about restarting payments, Cody Hounanian, executive director of the Student Debt Crisis Center (SDCC), recommends they look into different student loan repayment options as well as updates to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.\n\n\"Being aware of your income-driven repayment plan options will help ensure payments are affordable for those that have current payments or will have their payments turned back on after pandemic relief,\" Hounanian said.\n\nRonda is a personal finance senior reporter for Yahoo Money and attorney with experience in law, insurance, education, and government.

{"text": "Citi is bearish on lithium \u2014 at least for the near future. That's because China's huge electric vehicle market is showing signs of slowing, the bank said, citing the country's removal of EV subsidies and Tesla's suspension of production at its Shanghai plant. Lithium is a critical component of electric vehicle batteries. On top of that, demand in Europe has been slowing, thanks to high electricity prices and an economic slowdown, the bank added. \"[We] remain cautious on lithium commodity as \u2026 EVs sales could be softer in 2023 after the subsidy expires and China lithium spot price may face headwinds beyond 1Q23,\" Citi said in a Jan. 3 note. But the bank isn't turning fully negative on lithium, saying it's bullish on its long-term outlook. It expects lithium demand to increase its compound annual growth rate by around 20% by 2030, and that its supply will struggle to catch up. Names to watch Citi named three stocks to watch despite its cautious lithium outlook. Its most preferred name is U.S.-based Albemarle , which it gave a price target of $295, or 38% upside. Citi also likes Livent Corporation , which it gave a $27 target price, or 42% upside. But it warned that Livent, being a pure-play lithium producer, is a stock sensitive to changes in the lithium market. \"Lithium has the potential for high growth, driven by demand for battery applications. Therefore, changes in the pace of adoption for electric vehicles or electronics, due to energy prices or some other factors, could have significant implications for long-term lithium supply/demand,\" Citi analysts wrote. The bank added that as Livent's business is heavily reliant on its lithium resource in Argentina, the Salar del Hombre Muerto, any political or economic risks in the country would affect the firm. For instance, Argentina recently imposed an export tax on certain products including lithium, Citi noted. Citi also named Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile , the world's largest lithium producer, which soared 58% in 2022. Citi downgraded the stock from \"buy\" to \"neutral\" in mid-December, giving it a price target of $92 \u2014 with upside of about 20%. But the bank expects more risks to the downside for the firm, citing price volatility as a main risk to that target. \"Prices of SQM's products are linked to international prices, which vary significantly due to supply/demand dynamics,\" Citi said.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The thriving videoconferencing company Zoom Video Communications saw its shares fall sharply on Monday after the company provided a relatively modest forecast for its future financial results, with CEO Eric Yuan admitting he had noted increased scrutiny from regulators. The San Jose-based company, which went public in April with a valuation of $10 billion, has soared more than 560% since its initial public offering and trading peaked nearly $550 in October. Zoom is known for allowing users to connect with each other using video chat services for personal and professional reasons. But shares fell 6.8% on Monday, after Yuan, who was also the founder of Zoom, commented in a letter to shareholders that the company \"noted an increase in the level of regulatory review we received.\" In the letter, Yuan said that although privacy and security measures have been \"significantly strengthened\" since the beginning of this year, the company is still making investments to \"enhance our privacy and security practices\". The CEO added that while Zoom has been \"doing everything we can\" to properly implement its privacy and security measures, the company must consider changes to comply with changing regulations. Zoom said it now expects annual revenue of $2.37 billion to $2.39 billion, down from analyst estimate of $2.51 billion. The company says it still expects a operating margin of about 20%. In a letter to shareholders, Yuan said Zoom had to make \"short-term tradeoffs\" to keep up with the massive user growth it experienced this year when demand for the company's video conferencing products soared as people started working from home and keeping physical distance from each other during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the outbreak, Zoom's user base has surged from about 10 million in December 2019 to more than 300 million in October 2020, according to The Wall Street Journal. Revenue grew by 367% year-on-year in the third quarter as of October 31, reaching $777.2 million, exceeding analysts' expectations of $733 million. Yuan noted that Zoom has not made any changes to its products and plans to continue focusing on the user experience as well as privacy and security. \"We have a clear strategy to focus on users and the user experience, and know that we must continually seek to improve our privacy and security practices,\" Yuan wrote. Analysts said the stock price decline could be due to the company's lower forecast and Yuan's recognition of tightening regulatory scrutiny. \"The company provided guidance for 21 fiscal years down the street, but we think investors are now more focused on regulatory pressures from privacy and security issues,\" Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a note to clients Monday. Yuan said he believes Zoom's strong brand and products will make it a success in the long run, adding that he is encouraged by the positive feedback the company has received from users. \"The positive feedback we have received from users, particularly our educational customers, encourages us to continue investing in our products and services and focus on how best to serve our user base,\" he wrote. Looking ahead, the CEO said Zoom's board of directors was considering strategies to maximize shareholder value. While he did not mention any specific strategy, the company had previously suggested that it could seek \"a certain equity option allocation\" and other similar actions. Analysts said they believe Zoom shares have more room to grow, despite a sharp fall in share prices on Monday. \"Zoom has a unique user base and continues to be the 'it' stock in this new work from home/staying at home world that we live in,\" Ives wrote. \"The next 12 to 18 months will be critical for the company to monetize, and its user base is showing positive appeal so as to launch a cowboy book for the stock.\"", "label": "machine"}

It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I met my husband, Prince Kunle, I was at the peak of my modeling career.\n\nIt was the middle of New York Fashion Week in 2004, and all the models were going on show castings at the time. I was newly single and had just exited a relationship that was not for me. I was happy being single and was enjoying my career \u2014 I wasn't at all looking for a boyfriend.\n\nI was in Union Square, looking for an address for an audition that I was meant to be on. I didn't know this at the time, but the casting director had given the wrong address. So I'm standing there, calling my agency, and I felt someone's presence. I felt someone staring at me.\n\nI see Kunle standing there, and I'm thinking, \"Do I know this person?\"\n\nI didn't think that he would wait around for me to get off the phone, but he did.\n\nHe came up to me and said: \"You are the most beautiful person I've ever seen in my entire life. Would you do me the honor of having your number? Because I'd love to take you out.\"\n\nHonestly, I was thinking, \"Who talks like that?\" I made up a line that I had a boyfriend so that I couldn't give him my number, and I turned to walk away. But as I was about to go for my audition, my women's intuition said: \"You know what? He was kind. He wasn't rude. He was tall, dark, and handsome. You should just give him your number.\"\n\nSo I ran back up the steps, and he was still there, phone in hand, smiling as if he knew I would come back.\n\nWe dated for 2 years before I learned that Kunle was a prince\n\nWe dated for two years, and I did not know he was royal. I knew that he was Nigerian and that he previously lived in London, but I had no idea about his background.\n\nIn Nigerian culture, when you are serious about someone, that's when you introduce them to your family. I remember going to a family wedding and his mom coming out with open arms. It was almost like she knew me already.\n\nShe kept calling me \"my princess.\" I was thinking it was a term of endearment, since a lot of moms call their daughters princesses. That's when I discovered he was a royal. She started telling me the history of the kings, his name and its meaning, and where he was from.\n\nKeisha and Kunle at their former home in London in 2021. Mikhaila Friel/Insider\n\nKunle is a crown prince from the Arugbabuwo ruling house. Unlike the British royals, where there's one family and lots of royals within that family, in Nigeria there are many tribes and many royal families within those tribes. Not all of those tribes have a crown prince \u2014 the crown prince is the chosen one who is going to rule at a certain age.\n\nI remember thinking, \"We've been together for two years, and he just left that detail out?\"\n\nIt was a nice thing to know, but it didn't affect our lifestyle. It would have, if he had chosen to be king in Nigeria. That's when everything changes and you literally give up life as you know it. We would have to live and remain in Nigeria. We would not hold our own schedules and would not have the luxury of traveling when we want to travel or where we want to travel. It would no longer be acceptable for me to call Prince Kunle \"my baby,\" \"my honey,\" or any other name apart from King Omilana. We would also not have the freedom to be together every day and in every way like we are now.\n\nHe made it very clear to me that while this is his bloodline and this is who he is, it's not how he lives his life when he's not in Nigeria.\n\nWe started our married life in NYC before spending time in Dubai, Cyprus, and London\n\nWe married on January 28, 2006. Our son, Diran, was born later that year and our daughter, Dior, was born six years after that. Both of my children were born in New York, and about nine months after Diran's seventh birthday we moved to Dubai.\n\nA post shared by Princess Keisha Omilana (@keishaomilana)\n\nWe stayed there for about a year before moving to Cyprus. After a year in Cyprus, we moved back to London, which has always been a second home to Kunle.\n\nWe stayed in London for seven years. It was wonderful. We launched our companies there, and we raised Dior there. It was nice to be there with the children \u2014 to go back as a family was really fun.\n\nKunle and I experienced discrimination in the UK\n\nWe like to focus on positive things, but at the same time, it is always necessary to raise awareness of injustice. And this is for pretty much anyone and everyone who happens to not be English.\n\nThe discrimination occurred very subtly and was mostly witnessed in our business dealings and in one former neighborhood.\n\nIt's not even a racist thing, as far as us being Black. When it comes to England, what I've learned after being there for seven years is that it's a non-British thing. So the same thing that I'm feeling, that I've been discriminated against, my friend who is Australian \u2014 who is not Black \u2014 is going through.\n\nIt's more so: \"We are English, this is how we do it. And you're not one of us.\" Especially when you're doing business and you're moving in those circles and they're not used to seeing people who don't look like them.\n\nWe dealt with that quite a lot, and we just dealt with it with grace and ease. We stayed classy, we stayed professional, but it was something we noticed and experienced. I must say though that is not just a UK thing. Prince Kunle and I have traveled all over the world and lived on four continents. Discrimination has unfortunately been experienced before.\n\nIt is very important that this statement is not mistaken as a portrayal of myself as a helpless victim. In England, I encountered extremely subtle forms of discrimination. However, If I were an English elite, this exhausting act of one seeking to validate their accomplishments by working ten times harder to earn what one deserves would not have occurred. We all saw this play out in the press and media coverage of the Duchess of Sussex.\n\nI am keenly aware of the difference between how Meghan is covered in the news versus how Kate Middleton is covered in the news.\n\nI hear things like, \"How dare they leave?\" It's kind of like: \"Yes, we don't like you. But you have to stay here and hear it every day.\" Why would you want them to stay in that?\n\nI understand the struggles that Meghan Markle has faced\n\nI always say that Meghan Markle and I have a lot of parallels, just for the fact that we are both women of color, we are both married to royalty, we are both from California, and we're both actresses. We are also both feminists advocating for women's empowerment.\n\nMeghan Markle and Prince Harry in a promo for their docuseries, \"Harry & Meghan.\" Netflix\n\nI personally don't watch the news or read tabloids. I do that purposefully because a lot of the time it's just negative, and I don't want to feed my soul with negative energy. But I am aware of what's going on because I'm on social media and I hear about it.\n\nWhenever you are linked to someone or compared to someone, your eyes are opened to what their life is. I wish people would lead with empathy and put themselves in that person's shoes. Would you want to wake up every day and be scrutinized in a negative way?\n\nIt's a shame. And I really tip my hat to Harry and Meghan for standing up to The Firm, for choosing their happiness and their mental health, for saying that they want to live a life where they are free to be who they are.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "One kilo gold bars are pictured at the plant of gold and silver refiner and bar manufacturer Argor-Heraeus in Mendrisio, Switzerland, July 13, 2022. Denis Balibouse | Reuters\n\nLONDON \u2014 The price of gold notched a six-month high early on Tuesday, and analysts believe the rally has further to go in 2023. Spot gold peaked just below $1,850 per troy ounce in the early hours, before easing off to trade around $1,834 per ounce by late-morning in Europe. U.S. gold futures were up 0.8% at $1,840.50. Gold prices have been on a general incline since the beginning of November as market turbulence, rising recession expectations, and more gold purchases from central banks underpinned demand. \"In general, we are looking for a price friendly 2023 supported by recession and stock market valuation risks \u2014 an eventual peak in central bank rates combined with the prospect of a weaker dollar and inflation not returning to the expected sub-3% level by year-end \u2014 all adding support,\" said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank.\n\nLoading chart...\n\n\"In addition, the de-dollarization seen by several central banks last year when a record amount of gold was bought look set to continue, thereby providing a soft floor under the market.\" Looking ahead, Hansen suggested the key events for gold prices would be Wednesday's minutes from the latest U.S. Federal Reserve meeting and Friday's U.S. jobs report. \"Above $1842, the 50% [mark] of the 2022 correction, gold will be looking for resistance at $1850 and $1878 next,\" Hansen added. New all-time high in 2023? Much of the 2023 outlook for global markets hinges on the trajectory of monetary policy as central banks ease off the aggressive interest rate hikes of the past year amid slowing economic growth and possible recessions. Economists are divided as to whether this will culminate in rate cuts by the end of the year, however, as inflation is expected to remain well above the target range in most major economies. A full dovish pivot by central banks this year would likely have major implications for gold prices, according to strategists.\n\nwatch now\n\nEric Strand, manager of the AuAg ESG Gold Mining ETF, said last month that 2023 would yield a new all-time high for gold and the start of a \"new secular bull market,\" with the price exceeding $2,100 per ounce. \"Central banks as a group have continued, since the great financial crisis, to add more and more gold to their reserves, with a new record set for [the third quarter of] 2022,\" Strand said. \"It is our opinion that central banks will pivot on their rate hikes and become dovish during 2023, which will ignite an explosive move for gold for years to come. We therefore believe gold will end 2023 at least 20% higher, and we also see miners outperforming gold with a factor of two.\"\n\nwatch now", "label": "human"}

Stay wary of tech Wait to buy Constellation Stick with Wells Fargo 1. Stay wary of tech stocks Stocks rose Friday on signs wage growth is moderating , signaling the Federal Reserve is making progress in its fight to rein in inflation through higher interest rates. The S & P 500 climbed 1.6% in midmorning trading. However, Jim Cramer cautioned Friday that investors should still be wary of mega-cap tech stocks \u2013 these remain difficult to own, and the Club is exercising caution to ensure our tech exposure remains limited. 2. Wait to buy Constellation Brands Cowen on Friday downgraded Constellation Brands (STZ) to market perform from outperform, or buy, citing concerns that consumers will trade down alcoholic beverages as the economy slows. However, the beermaker continues to take market share while flexing its pricing power, so we still like the stock. Constellation on Thursday reported a weak 2023 fiscal third quarter, with the stock closing down nearly 10%. But shares climbed close to 3% in midmorning trading Friday, to roughly $215 apiece. We advise investors to hold off on buying STZ for now, until the dust settles. 3. Stick with Wells Fargo Deutsche Bank on Thursday downgraded JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Truist (TFC) to hold from buy, citing macroeconomic headwinds and concerns about weakening bank fundamentals. But not all banks are built the same, and Wells Fargo (WFC) remains a great stock to own despite analysts' concerns about the financial sector more broadly. While many banks are struggling to manage expenses, Wells Fargo is undergoing a multi-year restructuring program that puts it in a stronger position relative to its competitors.

{"text": "On Friday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) opposed a proposal by cryptocurrency exchange Binance.US to acquire Voyager Digital, the U.S. branch of global crypto exchange Binance. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said in a statement that it \"has decided not to approve Binance.US' proposal to acquire Voyager Digital,\" citing concerns that it may not be able to adequately protect consumers in the event of fraud or other transaction-related issues. The acquisition was announced in September 2020, when Katherine Coley, CEO of Binance.US, said it was a \"strategic move\" that would create \"the synergies to expand our offerings and provide our customers with a comprehensive cryptocurrency trading experience.\" The transaction will enable Binance.US to integrate Voyager's trading platform into its own products, expanding the product range of Binance.US, including stock trading and margin trading; it will also allow Binance.US to obtain a traveller's license to operate in the United States. The SEC's decision was a major setback for Binance.US, which had hoped to expand its services and reach deals. This move also raised doubts about the viability of transactions, as the SEC typically does not approve acquisitions or other major commercial transactions if it believes they could harm investors or consumers. The SEC notes that it still needs to determine whether Binance.US has \"fully considered\" how the acquisition will affect its ability to protect consumers. It says it will consider any additional information submitted in response to its objections and will decide on a final course of action in the near future. Binance.US has yet to comment on the SEC's decision, although some analysts believe it could mark the end of the deal. Given the uncertainty surrounding the matter, it is unclear whether and when the deal will be approved. Despite the setbacks, Binance.US continued to operate normally and launched a mobile app in November 2020. The company also recently announced a strategic partnership with cryptocurrency payment processing firm Wyre, which is expected to help expand its presence in the United States and overseas. As the SEC is currently reluctant to approve the transaction, Binance.US may be forced to explore other options or abandon the deal altogether. Only time will tell if the SEC will ultimately approve the acquisition, but for now, the decision remains and Binance.US must make adjustments accordingly.", "label": "machine"}

REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHAVANA, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. embassy in Havana resumed full immigrant visa processing and consular services for the first time since 2017 on Wednesday in a bid to stem the record-breaking flow of illegal migrants from Cuba north to the United States.\n\nThe embassy, which looms over Cuba's waterfront Malecon boulevard, slashed services in 2017 after several of its staff were stricken with a still largely unexplained ailment dubbed \"Havana Syndrome.\" It was first reported among U.S. officials in 2016 and symptoms included nausea and memory lapses.\n\nCubans were instead required to travel to Guyana for visa processing, a costly trip well out of reach for most on the island. The U.S. embassy in Havana began limited visa processing last year and in September announced the 2023 full reopening, to \"ensure safe, legal, and orderly migration of Cubans,\" it said.\n\nAt sunrise on Wednesday, dozens of Cubans, some who had waited years for appointments, assembled at a small park near the embassy, fidgeting with documents and chatting with family as they awaited instructions from embassy staff.\n\nBarbara Nodas, 20, said she was waiting to pick up a visa that would reunite her with her father in Tampa, Florida, a process that had taken more than two years.\n\n\"The American dream of many people is coming true,\" she said, nearly in tears. \"This is a long-awaited moment.\"\n\nBut Nodas, who traveled from eastern Cuba to pick up her visa, still ranks among the lucky few who will make the voyage north legally.\n\nWashington last year issued 20,000 immigrant visas to Cubans, including a limited number out of Havana, in line with previously signed migration accords, and has said it aims to do the same in 2023.\n\nCuba and the United States have also resumed once-regular talks on migration in a bid to tamp down the flow.\n\nBut a record-breaking 250,000 Cubans have nonetheless left the island in the past year for the United States, most via dangerous, irregular routes, traveling overland from Central America north to the border or across the Straits of Florida in precarious homemade rafts.\n\nCuba blames the U.S. embargo, a web of U.S. laws and regulations that complicate business and financial transactions with the island, for crippling its economy and fueling illegal migration.\n\nWidespread shortages of food, fuel, medicine and electricity - made worse by the coronavirus pandemic - have prompted scattered unrest on the island and sought many to seek alternatives abroad.\n\nReporting by Dave Sherwood and Mario Fuentes in Havana Editing by Matthew Lewis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "As tech giants continued to restructure their businesses during the pandemic, San Francisco-based Salesforce announced on Thursday that it had notified all fired U.S. employees. The cloud-based software giant confirmed in a statement that it had made \"difficult decisions\" to reduce its workforce, but did not specify how many people were affected. The company said it had \"properly notified and provided appropriate termination benefits to these employees\" and would continue to provide job transition and career guidance services through its social responsibility division, Salesforce Careers. Despite this, layoffs still seem to be a trend across the tech industry. TechCrunch recently reported that Salesforce has embarked on a series of layoffs around the world, with the United States among the first affected areas. The layoffs, combined with voluntary pay cuts, other cost-cutting measures and the fact that CEO Marc Benioff sold $29 million in shares around the same time, mean the company is going through a difficult period of restructuring. In a press release, he said: \"The last thing we want to do is lay off any employees - that's not how we do business. We are making changes to ensure we have the resources to succeed in the long run and serve our customers.\" He added: \"I would also like to thank all the employees who have taken on increased workloads, increased working hours and contributed to our successful transition in these challenging times. Despite the company's best efforts, there have been reports that more layoffs are being planned. According to The Wall Street Journal, Salesforce is likely to cut 10% of its global workforce, or about 3,000 jobs, mostly in the US and Europe. While Salesforce has yet to confirm these reports, some managers have reportedly told their teams that there may be redundancies.Some of the teams were reportedly told they could expect to hear more details in the near future. In addition, Bloomberg reported that Salesforce is considering canceling or suspending its stock buyback program and will cut hiring. If these reports are to be believed, then Salesforce seems to be reorganizing in order to remain competitive in the current market. After all, it is not the only tech giant that has made such changes to survive this difficult economic period. In fact, many companies in the tech industry have had to lay off staff and make changes to stay alive. Companies like Twitter, Microsoft, Google, and Apple have taken steps to reduce costs and align their workforces to fit the current economic environment. For now, Salesforce will continue to support employees and do its best to cope with difficult situations. However, the news is not good for those who are affected by layoffs or other restructuring measures. Despite the company's efforts to support employees, it seems that some employees may have to go elsewhere to find work.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nOmie Dale has fond memories of splashing in the sea as a child, of racing through water parks and swimming in backwaters and rivers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much joy that can be had once you learn to swim, once you\u2019ve abandoned those fears and you can get in the water,\u201d the 25-year-old Dale, who is based in southeast London, tells CNN Sport.\n\nEven though swimming is a joyful experience for Dale, the stark reality is that many Black communities in Britain and the US do not have safe access to swimming lessons and public pools due to historic racism and segregation \u2013 a problem that is especially alarming given that, as Dale says, it is \u201cthe only sport that can save your life.\u201d\n\nA history of exclusion\n\nThe lack of access afforded to Black communities in Britain is what motivated Dale to become a swimming teacher in September 2019.\n\n\u201cI used to work in Kensington (in London) as a lifeguard and some of the richest people live in that borough, but also some of the poorest,\u201d she says. She saw there was a difference when private schools and independent schools would come in and all the kids were able to swim, yet hardly any children of the same age that Dale saw from state schools could swim 25 meters.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real class barrier in the sport of swimming,\u201d Dale adds.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Meet the Black women pushing for equality in swimming 04:56 - Source: CNN\n\nShe is a director of Swimunity, a collective offering free swimming lessons to women and children in North Kensington, West London.\n\nIt was born in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster in 2017, when a residential block caught on fire, killing 72 people \u2013 and leaving many more without homes.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s like a lot of people who come to swim lessons \u2026 who have undergone some form of trauma, whether that be water-related trauma or trauma related to their everyday lives,\u201d Dale says.\n\n\u201cMany people say it\u2019s like an escape from their daily lives or is, actually, the first time that they\u2019ve taken time for themselves.\u201d\n\nWhile 77% of children from the most affluent families in England can swim 25 meters unaided, only 34% from the least affluent families can, according to a 2021 survey from Sport England, a non-departmental public body that fosters grassroots sports in England.\n\nAbout 95% of Black adults and 80% of Black children in England do not regularly participate in swimming, according to Sport England\u2019s report, published in January 2020.\n\nLikewise, about 93% of Asian adults and 78% of Asian children, including those with Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage, do not regularly participate in swimming, the same research found.\n\nThis trend extends to the US, where nearly 64% of Black children have \u201clow\u201d or no ability to swim, compared with 40% of their White peers, according to 2017 data from the country\u2019s national governing body for the sport at a competitive level, USA Swimming.\n\nThe underrepresentation of Black people in the pool in the US can be traced back to the early 20th century.\n\nPublic swimming pools became popular in North America in the 1920s and 30s and were initially open to all. However, Northern politicians stipulated a \u201cWhites Only\u201d rule, referencing racist fears about Black men fraternizing with White women.\n\nOmie Dale told CNN Sport that \"there's a real class barrier in the sport of swimming.\" Dale founded Swimunity in 2020 to help address structural barriers and introduce the joy of swimming to as many people as possible. Louis Lesson/CNN\n\nEven after legal racial segregation ended in the US in 1964, public pools continued to be hostile environments. As people of color began to use public pools, White swimmers retreated to the privacy of their own pools and private clubs, where expensive fees continue to be an economic barrier for Black families who cannot afford the cost.\n\nSimilar examples in Britain illustrate how racial and class inequalities lead to the systemic exclusion of Black people in pools. For example, more than 4.2 million people in the UK live in ethnically diverse communities where Covid-19 national lockdowns resulted in the closure or mothballing of pools, according to Swim England \u2013 England\u2019s national swimming governing body \u2013 and the Black Swimming Association (BSA), a UK-based charity that aims to encourage more African, Caribbean and Asian communities to take up swimming.\n\n\u2018We cannot keep recovering bodies\u2019\n\nGlobally, drowning is the third leading cause of accidental injury-related death and at least 236,000 people die each year from drowning, according to 2019 data from the World Health Organization (WHO). Children are particularly affected, with drowning being one of the top five causes of death for those aged 1-14 years in 48 of 85 countries studied by the WHO.\n\nAnd while natural disasters and irregular migration are notorious risk factors, so are lower socioeconomic status, lack of higher education and being a member of an ethnic minority, depending on the country, WHO research shows.\n\n\u201cMost drowning incidents happen when people never intend to get into the water in the first place,\u201d says Dale, who was awarded Swim Teacher of the Year by Swim England in 2021.\n\nIn December 2019, three members of the same Black British family \u2013 a 53-year-old father and his two children \u2013 died in a swimming pool at a resort in Costa del Sol, Spain, Reuters reported. The father and his 16-year-old son had reportedly leapt into the water to try to save his nine-year-old daughter, who was drowning.\n\nDanielle Obe is the co-founder and chair of the Black Swimming Association (BSA). Louis Leeson/CNN\n\nDanielle Obe is the co-founder and chair of the BSA. She told CNN Sport that the Costa del Sol deaths prompted her to establish the BSA in March 2020, alongside Olympic swimmer Alice Dearing, journalist Seren Jones and songwriter, rapper and producer Ed Accura.\n\n\u201cThis was devastating because these families were actually acquainted to me and they were from my local community,\u201d Obe says. \u201c(At) that point, I called Alice and Seren, and I said, \u2018We\u2019ve been talking about doing something for our community. We\u2019ve got to do something. We\u2019ve got to do it now. We cannot keep recovering bodies.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something. We\u2019ve got to do it now. We cannot keep recovering bodies.\u201d Danielle Obe, Black Swimming Association (BSA) chair and co-founder\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no longer just about that lack of representation,\u201d Obe adds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now about saving lives, vital water safety, education for all. Swimming is an intervention. Swimming is a life skill.\u201d\n\nHowever, there is still a lack of data when it comes to drowning-related deaths by ethnicity in the UK, says Obe.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, we don\u2019t know how much of a disparity there is between drowning and fatalities, aquatic fatalities for different communities in the UK because, up until now, drowning data isn\u2019t really captured by ethnicity, which is another point, another issue that the BSA is looking to tackle.\u201d\n\n\u2018People just don\u2019t think Black people should swim\u2019\n\nDearing, the first Black female swimmer to represent Britain at the Olympics when she competed at Tokyo 2020, \u201cimplores\u201d people to learn to swim.\n\n\u201cI have been quite torn between the amazing achievement of being the first Black woman to represent GB in swimming but wanting to be my own person, my own athlete, who\u2019s known for being an athlete and not for her race and her sport combined together,\u201d she tells CNN Sport.\n\n\u201cI take the two of them just as they are \u2013 kind of like separate things. I\u2019m trying to be the best athlete and best role model that I can be to show people that they can do the sport, that the sport is for everybody.\u201d\n\nAt the age of 24, Dearing was making history in Japan and became a beacon of hope for young people \u2013 especially Black girls \u2013 who wanted to break into the sport.\n\nBut her personal triumph also drew attention to the institutional access gap for people of color in swimming.\n\nAlice Dearing co-founded the BSA with Obe and several others to help encourage more minority communities to take up swimming. Louis Leeson/CNN\n\n\u201cFortunately, for myself, I haven\u2019t come across any barriers at the level I\u2019m at currently,\u201d Dearing says.\n\n\u201cBut I have faced barriers when I was younger and issues where people just don\u2019t think Black people should swim, or do swim, or think that we\u2019re better suited to other sports and so shouldn\u2019t even learn to swim or attempt swimming in the first place.\u201d\n\nCNN reached out to the International Swimming Federation (FINA), Sport England and USA Swimming requesting a breakdown of Black and ethnic minority participation in swimming at grassroots and professional levels of the sport. However, they told CNN they were unable to provide such data.\n\nFINA \u2013 the global governing body for swimming \u2013 told CNN it does not have a breakdown of the ethnicities of swimmers at a grassroots or elite level.\n\nFINA said in 2021 it allocated $6.6 million towards development programs for distribution among all national federations and continental associations, while also pushing for diversity in the sport through its \u201cSwimming for All, Swimming for Life\u201d program.\n\n\u201cFINA remains fully committed to non-discrimination,\u201d the organization said to CNN in a statement. \u201cFINA continues to work hard to ensure that the global aquatics community is a place where all athletes, coaches and administrators are treated equally.\n\n\u201cWork will continue to develop and grow with the support of members of the aquatics community as we strive to be at the forefront of this essential area,\u201d FINA added.\n\n\u201cI have faced barriers when I was younger and issues where people just don\u2019t think Black people should swim, or do swim, or think that we\u2019re better suited to other sports and so shouldn\u2019t even learn to swim or attempt swimming in the first place.\u201d Alice Dearing, Olympic swimmer and BSA co-founder\n\nSport England told CNN in a statement that it is \u201ccommitted to increasing investment in facilities and organisations across England to try to level up access to good quality sports and activities.\u201d\n\n\u201cBarriers to getting active persist and have even been exacerbated for some disadvantaged groups \u2013 like women, people with long-term health conditions, disabled people, people from ethnically diverse communities and lower socio-economic groups,\u201d the statement added.\n\nSport England said in May it announced further funding that brings its total investment in its 121 partners to more than \u00a3550 million ($670 million), which they\u2019ve selected \u201cdue to their unique position to tackle entrenched activity inequalities and influence positive change throughout the sector, their own networks and beyond.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not all about the economic side of things. It is also about getting people to feel comfortable with putting their kids in swim lessons and in competitive swimming so that they can then go and do other aquatic-based sports,\u201d Joel Shinofield, the managing director of sport development at USA Swimming, told CNN during a phone call.\n\nUSA Swimming is a membership-serviced organization that has over 3,100 clubs and more than 400,000 members, according to the official website.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to facilitate opportunities and make sure they\u2019re good ones. While our clubs are the ones that do that on the local level, the resources, guidance, support, financial investment that we provide can shift who those opportunities can be provided to and more broadly create access,\u201d he added.\n\nShinofield said that USA Swimming has established a 10-year initiative that will grant $1 million to develop learn-to-swim and competitive opportunities for communities served by Historical Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The program was announced in 2021, according to the USA Swimming official website.\n\nServing underrepresented communities\n\nFrom representing their organization at the UK\u2019s first Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Summit For Sport in Birmingham, England earlier this year to facilitating swimming classes in Hackney \u2013 one of the most deprived boroughs in London \u2013 Obe hopes that the BSA will help bridge the barrier through community-level engagement.\n\n\u201cThat community engagement really is to build trust, accountability and collaboration with disenfranchised communities and the sector,\u201d says Obe.\n\n\u201cOnly in understanding these attitudes and understanding some of the barriers that preclude our communities from engaging in aquatics can we begin to drive change.\u201d\n\nIn August 2021, the BSA announced it would conduct a research program with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the University of Portsmouth, exploring the behaviors and barriers that prevent African, Caribbean and Asian communities from swimming.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much joy that can be had once you learn to swim, once you\u2019ve abandoned those fears and you can get in the water.\u201d Omie Dale, Swimunity Director and Instructor\n\nSpeaking about the program, Obe says: \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to inspire confidence with African, Caribbean and Asian communities, and the only way we\u2019re able to do that is to ensure that we understand where these communities are in the first place and understand why they don\u2019t engage in aquatics, why we don\u2019t see the representation pool side and why we don\u2019t even see the representation within some aquatic organizations.\u201d\n\nDale also volunteers with Mental Health Swims, a grassroots organization that facilitates swimming meet-ups for people struggling with their mental health.

{"text": "Chief Justice John Roberts on Friday used his year-end report on the state of the federal judiciary to call for improved security at court facilities and personnel in the wake of a recent series of attacks. But Roberts has avoided mentioning recent scandals or proposing changes to the moral rules of the court system, including plans that require federal judges to more fully disclose their financial interests. In his annual report to Congress, Roberts stressed the need to protect justice offices and personnel, and reiterated his comments following two incidents in recent months. \"We have to make sure our courts are safe and that they remain secure, accessible and open to business,\" Roberts wrote. In November, security measures were called for after a shooting outside federal court in Austin, Texas. One security guard was seriously injured but no one else was injured. Roberts also cited an incident last December in which a man was arrested for \"verbal threats against federal court staff in the District of Columbia.\" In light of these and other security incidents, Roberts said the U.S. Judicial Conference, the policy-making arm of the federal judiciary, is \"actively studying and considering security improvements in federal courts.\" \"The safety of the courts is a complex challenge, and we are working to strike the right balance between keeping our facilities safe and inviting all those who use them,\" Roberts wrote. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court did not mention two other more controversial issues that have affected the judicial system in recent months: a proposal to rewrite the code of ethics for the court system, and an abortion plan by a federal judge in Alabama proposing a draft opinion on abortion which was leaked to a news outlet. The proposed changes to the ethics of the court system, including enhanced disclosure of judges' financial assets and allowing for the use of cameras in court, have drawn strong opposition from many members of the legal community. The Supreme Court announced in April that the proposed changes were under review, but Roberts did not mention the issue in his report. In October, the abortion opinion written by Ed Carnes, chief judge of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, was leaked to legal website 360. The opinion was never made public, raising speculation and questions about how to obtain a draft opinion. But instead of mentioning the leak in his report, Roberts offers a broad perspective on what the court system has accomplished in 2020, from dealing with the coronavirus pandemic to installing a new national bankruptcy filing system. \"Despite this year's turmoil, the work of the Federal Court has not stopped,\" he said. \"Our justice system has responded with dedication, agility and determination in the face of major new and old challenges.\" He also highlighted the court system's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, noting that it had \"significant technological investments\" in order to continue providing services to the public. \"Remote tools are helping many court stakeholders continue their work,\" Roberts wrote, \"In many areas they allow prisoners to participate in the proceedings via video, guardians can appear remotely to manage the affairs of the people they represent, jurors provide services while protecting themselves and others, and individuals can make payments to the court without being exposed to a virus.\" But Roberts noted that the epidemic is also putting pressure on court resources, and said the court system must be prepared to respond to \"changing circumstances.\" \"Our court system must have the necessary technology and personnel to deal with any uncertainties in the future,\" Roberts wrote. \"We must be prepared for the future and remain vigilant to defend public trust in the Federal Court.\"", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "A temporary shelter in Woodlawn for recently arrived asylum seekers that has sparked controversy isn\u2019t expected to open up this week after all, according to Ald. Jeanette Taylor, whose 20th Ward includes the property.\n\nCity officials confirmed last week that the James Wadsworth Elementary School at 6420 S. University Ave., would be converted into a temporary shelter for newly arrived immigrants seeking asylum. A spokesperson for Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s office did not return requests seeking comment Thursday about the delayed opening.\n\nThe shelter, which had been slated to open Friday, will instead open at a later date to allow for another community forum, which residents had pushed for, Taylor said. The opening will also be contingent on the creation of a safety and security plan for in and around the property.\n\n\u201cI feel like my heart was in the ground,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s back in my chest.\u201d\n\nSince late August, Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has sent hundreds of asylum seekers to Democrat-led cities like Chicago. More than 3,850 asylum seekers had arrived on chartered buses from Texas as of last week, according to city officials. In addition, the city has provided services for 1,400 asylum seekers who have arrived to Chicago in recent months.\n\nIn a statement released Thursday, Lightfoot said the city was at \u201cmaximum capacity\u201d in housing and services for asylum seekers.\n\n\u201cThus, it would simply be inhumane for cities and states to continue sending migrants to Chicago. Treating migrants like freight must end. It is simply immoral,\u201d Lightfoot said in the prepared statement that did not address the Wadsworth property.\n\nWhile some Woodlawn residents completely oppose the shelter, others wanted the city to answer their questions, Taylor said.\n\n\u201cThis was imposed on us,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they came to the community or me.\u201d\n\nThe delay in opening means Taylor won\u2019t be joining residents who had planned to protest the shelter. Taylor had said there were concerns about the impact the shelter will have on Woodlawn residents and on the newly arrived asylum seekers who won\u2019t be near immigrant resources.\n\nJennifer Maddox, an aldermanic candidate for the 20th Ward, said she was not notified about the delayed opening, but other residents received an email late Wednesday from the city indicating the date had been pushed back to allow for another community meeting. Maddox was among a group of residents who had a news conference Thursday morning to air their concerns.\n\n\u201cWe just want the mayor to really come to Woodlawn to speak to the residents,\u201d Maddox said by phone Thursday afternoon. \u201cThey want to see her, they want to talk to her. They want her to answer herself reasons why she decided to do that.\u201d\n\nMaddox said she attended the community forum that was held in late December, but she walked away with few answers. One of her biggest concerns about the temporary shelter centers around safety.\n\nThere is also a sense that the Woodlawn community\u2019s call for resources is being ignored while funds are diverted to the community of newly arrived asylum seekers, she said. This has lead to residents feeling like they were \u201cslapped in the face\u201d or not good enough to receive the resources, Maddox said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not against migrants at all,\u201d Maddox said. \u201cBut we need to understand that there are an existing population of people that reside or are in the community that need some of the resources as well. We want to make sure it\u2019s equitable to all.\u201d\n\nCommunity concerns about the shelter come as Lightfoot has pushed for lawmakers to provide the city with more funding to assist the asylum seekers.

Soaring inflation and rising interest rates have pushed investors away from growth and into companies with high profit margins, consistent cash flow and high dividend yields.\n\nBut Amazon investors have had other reasons to exit the stock. The company is contending with slowing sales, as predictions of a sustained post-Covid e-commerce boom didn't pan out. At the height of the pandemic, consumers came to depend on online retailers like Amazon for goods ranging from toilet paper and face masks to patio furniture. That drove Amazon's stock to record highs as sales soared.\n\nAs the economy reopened, consumers gradually returned to shopping in stores and spending on things like travel and restaurants, which caused Amazon's impressive revenue growth to fade. The situation only worsened at the start of this year, as the company confronted higher costs tied to inflation, the war in Ukraine and supply chain constraints.\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy, who succeeded founder Jeff Bezos at the helm in July 2021, admitted that the company hired too many workers and overbuilt its warehouse network as it raced to keep up with pandemic-era demand.

Reynolds is the author of children's and young adult books, in collaboration with the American Library Association and its REFORGE initiative, launched the American Library Association's \"Let's Read!\" program. The goal of the program is to help young people, especially those in underserved communities, find books they contact, have meaningful conversations about them, and explore opportunities for expressing their interests in libraries. \"We want them to feel like libraries are the spaces they explore, dream and imagine,\" Reynolds said. Reynolds wanted to be an advocate for young people's access to literacy, and he recognized the importance of expanding literacy beyond textbooks to create meaningful learning experiences. He spoke passionately about the need to connect young people with different stories from other children like them. \"I think it's extremely important that the books young people are reading make them feel seen,\" says Reynolds. \"That's why it's so important for us to showcase books related to their own background and experiences. We want them to find a book that reflects who they are, and have a sense of connection with it.\" Reynolds has received several awards, including the Newbury Honor Award and the Coretta Scott Gold Writer's Honor Award. He understands the power of storytelling and its impact on young people's lives. Therefore, he is committed to helping young readers discover their own stories. In addition to introducing young people with books reflecting their background, the Let's Read! program includes activities that encourage dialogue on literature, including book clubs, author visits, calligraphy and storytelling workshops. \"We've done a lot to get kids involved in reading,\" says Reynolds, \"and we want them to think about how books and stories affect the decisions they make in life. We also want them to know that reading is an enjoyable activity that can help them out of their daily troubles.\" Reynolds is also committed to promoting literacy in public libraries across the country, and he recently joined staff at Buffalo and Erie County Public Libraries to lead a series of literacy seminars. He has also given lectures in libraries around the country to disseminate information that can make a meaningful difference in the lives of young people. \"Books open up the world to us in ways we can't touch with our own eyes and experiences,\" says Reynolds. \"We want young people to know that reading is not just about remembering facts, it's about discovering new places, learning about different cultures, and creating a dialogue about literature that will truly change their lives.\" At the end of the day, Reynolds wants all young people to know that their stories matter and that books can be a bridge to discover more about who they are and where they want to go. \"We want young people to know that their stories matter,\" Reynolds said. \"That's why we are committed to providing them with books that reflect their own experiences. We want them to be able to express their stories in a way they feel comfortable, and that's what the 'Let's Read' program is all about.\" In an era of declining literacy rates, Reynolds' commitment to helping young people find their stories and engage in literary careers is more important than ever. As a strong advocate for literacy and youth around the world, he will continue to use his voice to spread the message that reading is essential and all stories have power.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. fell on Tuesday, even as the drug chain reported fourth-quarter results, easily surpassing Wall Street's expectations. The Dirfield, Illinois-based retailer reported net sales of $6.59 billion in the three months ended December 31, surpassing analysts' expected revenue of $6.50 billion. Walgreens also reported net income of $833 million, or 96 cents per share. Analysts expect a gain of 91 cents per share. However, the company's stock price fell 7.3% on the same day. While both on-line and offline results have been hit, investors are likely to expect more from drugstore chains. According to FactSet, the company's co-store sales for the quarter ended up at 2.7%, down from the 3.7% growth analysts sought. Walgreens also warned that the company will not be able to achieve its long-term goal of 6% to 8% growth in co-store sales by 2020. But CEO Stefano Pessina said the company's retail pharmacy and health beauty unit still performed well, noting that sales for the quarter were \"healthy.\" \"We are confident that we have the ability to move forward and grow in a healthy and profitable way,\" he said. Walgreens' retail pharmacy business had net sales of $20.9 billion, up 5.8 percent from the same period a year ago, while its health and beauty unit reported sales of $10.9 billion, jumping 3.2 percent. Meanwhile, the company's pharmacy services business (including its prescription drug division) was a highlight for the quarter. The segment's net sales increased 8.4% to $22.4 billion. However, Pessina warned that sales could be under pressure in the coming quarters due to this epidemic. \"We expect recent sales growth to continue to be affected by the outbreak,\" he said, adding that this year's sales comparison remains particularly challenging. Despite this, the pharmacy giant still hopes to expand in size over the next few years and is investing in new stores and services. The company said it plans to open 1,400 new stores and add 1,400 new services in the U.S. over the next three years. Walgreens also said it plans to invest in existing stores and renovate 2,000 locations over the same period. The company is also investing in technology and plans to implement a new inventory management system that will help reduce costs and improve the customer experience. Looking ahead, the company expects sales to be \"in line with or slightly below\" its fourth quarter results but will be \"normalized\" within a year. However, analysts are divided on Walgreens' prospects. Some have warned that the stock may continue to be under pressure from the pandemic, while others are optimistic about the company's long-term outlook. \"Walgreens' strategic plan, a strong portfolio of retail brands, and investments in technology and prescription drug market share put it at the forefront of increasing vaccine supply,\" Raymond James analyst Christopher Rossbach said in a note to investors. \"We are optimistic about Walgreens' long-term outlook and maintain our excellent performance rating.\"", "label": "machine"}

On March 5, 2021, the world witnessed three Russian astronauts Alexander Yegorov, Vitaly Kovalev and Nikolai Hutowski trying to become the first people to go beyond Earth's atmosphere. These three astronauts are part of a joint Russian-American exploration of the outermost reaches of the solar system. The mission was a success, with the three successfully flying their Soyuz spacecraft to more than 350 million kilometers from Earth. They made several discoveries, including a new planet, a mysterious black hole and evidence of possible alien civilizations. However, there was a tragedy when the spacecraft entered the radiation belt, where powerful radiation from that zone caused severe damage to the spacecraft's systems and cut off communication links with Earth. The crews are now trapped in the darkness of outer space with no hope of getting rescued. They run low on oxygen, food and water without any connection to Earth mission control. Unable to know if their situation will improve, brave astronauts prepare for the worst. The three tragically died in space on March 7, 2021, and the bond they shared was forever linked to their heroic pursuit of knowledge. A commemorative event was held in Moscow, where hundreds of people gathered to pay tribute to three brave astronauts. The whole world is mourning the loss of those who risked their lives to expand our knowledge of the universe.The families of these three people have been given special honour by the Russian Government, which has declared a national day of mourning and remembrance. The tragedy of their loss is a clear reminder of the risks posed by space exploration. While this mission ultimately succeeded, it was also a reminder of the sacrifices made by those who dared to venture into an unknown world. They are a reminder of humanity's desire to explore the depths of outer space and unravel its secrets. In their memory, we honor the courage and perseverance needed to explore the great unknown.", "label": "machine"}

U.S. policy does not allow for the joint control of nuclear assets anywhere in the world.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"This is going to be done through a variety of ways, including as President Yoon said, through enhanced information-sharing, joint planning and expanding the range of contingencies that we plan for, as well as training, and with the idea eventually leading up to a tabletop exercise,\" the U.S. official told Reuters.\n\nThe timing of the planned exercises has not been finalised, but they would take place \"in the not-too-distant future\" and cover scenarios including but not limited to nuclear situations, the official said.\n\n\"The idea is to also try and make sure that we're able to fully think through the range of possibilities based on the DPRK capabilities which they've demonstrated, as well as their statements,\" that official added, using North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\n\nWhen asked about the tabletop exercises, a spokesperson for South Korea's defence ministry said talks were under way but declined to provide details.\n\nThe two countries have revived consultations on extended deterrence this year after a years-long hiatus while North Korea increased its nuclear and missile capability.\n\nPyongyang defined South Korea as an \"undoubted enemy\" and vowed to beef up its nuclear arsenal this year, after firing a record number of missiles in 2022 and fuelling tension by sending drones into the South in December.\n\n\"The U.S. countermeasures have not kept up with the North's advancing nuclear programmes, and the extended deterrence strategy is almost no different from when their nuclear capability was insignificant and weaker,\" said Go Myong-hyun, a research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul.\n\nBut Kim Dong-yup, a professor at Kyungnam University, said the comment from Biden, who has sole authority to authorise the use of U.S. nuclear weapons, suggests an American reluctance to share nuclear operations, given their sensitivity and security concerns.\n\n\"Given growing voices for tactical nuclear weapons, Washington could try to give reassurances and send more nuclear assets when we want, but they're unlikely to fully materialise President Yoon's push for greater extended deterrence,\" Kim said.\n\n(Reporting by Soo-hyang Choi and Hyonhee Shin in Seoul and Trevor Hunnicutt in Washington; Additional reporting by Simon Lewis and David Brunnstrom in Washington; Editing by Gerry Doyle and Stephen Coates)", "label": "human"}

{"text": "OpenAI, the leading AI startup, is reportedly in talks to sell some of its shares, an offer that could double its valuation to $29 billion. The news, reported by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) on Saturday, has since caused a sensation in the tech community as OpenAI has been at the forefront of developing some of the most advanced AI technologies. OpenAI, a San Francisco-based AI research lab founded in late 2014 by Elon Musk and Y Combinator's Sam Altman, was initially funded by Musk, Altman, and several other prominent investors including Peter Thiel, Reid Hoffman, Vinod Khosla, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. Since then, it has become a major player in the field of artificial intelligence, and its work has been praised for its success in this area. The company's most famous development is its artificial intelligence-driven natural language processing system called GPT-3, the world's most powerful AI language model.GPT-3 has been used to create a range of applications and services, from creating movie scripts to generating creative art, among others. According to the Wall Street Journal, OpenAI is in talks with a number of potential investors about bid offers and it is believed that the company can raise up to $2 billion from the sale. If negotiations are successful, this will double the valuation of the company, which currently stands at $15 billion. This move could provide OpenAI with much-needed funding to continue its work in the field of artificial intelligence. It may also attract a range of new investors who are eager to get part of the action. It is not clear who the potential investors were in the tender, or what their motivation was. Nor is it clear whether OpenAI will retain any ownership after its sale. Nevertheless, this move is significant for OpenAI and could provide the company with much-needed financial incentives to continue working in the field of AI. It will also mark an important milestone for the startup that was founded just five years ago on a bold mission to advance the state of AI. In recent years, OpenAI has not been the only AI startup whose valuations have soared. In recent months, a number of well-known AI startups, including Google's DeepMind, Facebook's Wit.ai and Microsoft's AI factory, have seen their valuations skyrocket. The surge in valuations of AI startups reflects the growing interest and demand for AI technology, which is largely driven by an increasing reliance on AI to solve complex problems and automate ordinary tasks. OpenAI's sale of its stake will also greatly boost San Francisco's startup ecosystem, as it can attract new capital and investors into the region. This is especially helpful for start-ups trying to expand their business and take on more ambitious projects. It remains to be seen whether the negotiations will lead to a successful tender, but it is clear that OpenAI has impressed the tech community and will become a major player in AI. Whatever happens in the next few days, one thing is certain: OpenAI will always exist.", "label": "machine"}

However, any anxiety should be quelled by the reassuring news from Bob Doll, a former senior official in Blackstone's stock division, who believes that markets should rise despite the ongoing global health crisis. Doll, who served as the company's global shareholder president from 2001 to 2016, told Business Insider that a crash caused by an economic downturn is unlikely this year and it should be expected that the stock market will be healthy. \"I don't think there is any real risk of a stock market crash,\" he said. \"If we can get out of the current health crisis, then I think we have good reason to expect stocks to be strong for another year. I think we should see healthy returns.\" This forecast comes after the 2020 S&P 500 index grew by 16% year-on-year, while the tech giant Nasdaq composite index rose by 38%. Doll believes that most markets in 2023 will likely be affected by the Biden administration's and the Fed's response to a global pandemic. The incoming government pledged unprecedented economic assistance to businesses and individuals, while the central bank said it would keep interest rates low to encourage growth. \"I think the market will look to the government and the Federal Reserve to continue doing everything they can to support economic growth and stability,\" Doll said.

Finally, Doyle said investors should remember that despite the uncertainties in the global economy, stock markets still offer solid long-term returns. \"It's important to remember that the stock market isn't gambling, it's investing,\" he said. \"People should focus on long-term investments and not be too addicted to short-term setbacks.\"", "label": "machine"}

The two teams are scheduled to face an AFC South game on December 26, 2021 that could affect the playoffs. Titans have a 3-1 record against Jaguars in the past four years and will seek to outperform their division rivals in this competition. The Titans were relatively successful in the 2020 season, ending with a record of 11-5 and postseason parking. They were knocked out by the Baltimore Raptors in the first round of the playoffs, but the team showed great promise for Ryan Tannehill's first full season as head quarterback. The Jaguars, on the other hand, want to restart after one of the worst seasons in their history in 2021. In the 2021 NFL draft, they have a total number one option and will seek to meet several key needs through their top selection. For the Titans, Derrick Henry, who has run back, will seek to add strength to his impressive 2020 season. Henry last year set a franchise record for one single season's hottest course with 2,027 yards and is preparing for an even bigger 2021. Meanwhile, the Jaguars will focus on what kind of impact new quarterback Trevor Lawrence can have. Laurens was selected as champion in the 2021 draft and is expected to make a major impact during his debut season. The two teams will face each other for the first time since they won 24-20 in November 2018. In recent years, Titan's head-to-head games have performed better, beating Jaguar six times in the past eight games. Titan and the Jaguars will have an exciting game in their 18th week as both teams seek to make a difference in AFC South. Titan wants to return to playoff after the end of the 2020 season, while the Jaguars want to make a statement with their young squad.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Illinois is at a crossroads when it comes to selling unneeded land. The need for additional income has been pressing for years, and in order to meet these needs, state officials have been considering selling some of the unwanted land. Recently, the issue was raised when Illinois sold some unneeded land to private developers. The sale was strongly opposed by many residents of the state who felt they had no say in the decision and felt that they were not being dealt a fair blow. The problem is that Illinois currently has no specific rules or regulations governing the sale of land it does not need. This allows the state to accept accusations of bias or shadow trading in these property sales. With the right rules, the state can ensure that any land sale is conducted in a transparent and fair manner, while ensuring that the funds generated from the sale are used for projects that benefit the entire country. To that end, many in the Illinois Legislature are pushing for a new set of regulations to regulate sale of unneeded land in Illinois. The proposed rule would require any interested buyer to submit detailed proposals detailing the land development plan, the environmental benefits of the proposed use and the economic benefits of the project for the region. Once the proposal is submitted, the State will review it and make a decision based on the substance of the plan. The decision will then be publicly consulted by the public, allowing citizens to express their views and ensuring that the transaction is beneficial to the State and fair to the buyer. If the proposal is approved, the funds generated from the sale will be used for projects that directly benefit the State and its citizens. The proposed set of regulations has sparked a legislative debate, with some arguing that the rules are too stringent and could eventually prevent potential buyers from submitting unneeded land tenders. But others argue that these rules will ensure that any sale of land is conducted in a fair and transparent manner, while ensuring that the proceeds from the sale are used for projects that benefit the country and its citizens. Ultimately, it's up to Illinois lawmakers to decide whether the proposed rule is the right path. But it's clear that something needs to be done about selling unwanted land. With the right regulations, Illinois can ensure that land sales in any state are conducted in a fair and transparent manner, and that the funds generated are used for projects that benefit the entire nation.", "label": "machine"}

In Sacramento County, southeast of Fort Bragg's Mendocino County, crews used any pauses in the rain to work to repair levees south of the state capital that had been breached by the first of several anticipated waves of storms that began on New Year's Eve, leading to flooding that killed at least three people.\n\nIn the popular seaside village of Mendocino just south of Noyo Harbor, Big River Beach was unrecognizable under heaps of debris including trees that had been ripped from the ground by winds of up to 50 miles per hour. Foamy water ponded on the sand, and the briny smell of the ocean was more pungent than usual.\n\nWaves overnight in the area reached 33 feet, and winds reached 50 miles per hour. Waves of up to 30 feet were predicted for Thursday.\n\nAt the southern end of Mendocino county, the small towns of Point Arena and Gualala have been largely without power for around 24 hours. About 2,500 households and businesses were without power in the county, which is home to about 91,000 people.\n\nCalifornia's storied coast road, Highway 1, is closed in four places in Mendocino County because of fallen trees, the California Department of Transportation said. Fog, flooding and rock slides contributed to closures along the highway in other parts of the state.\n\nNo fishing boats were set to go out Thursday morning from Noyo Harbor, where small recreational boats and large commercial vessels have slips, and crab, rockfish and salmon are among the typical catches.\n\nThe high tide brought swells that washed debris across the beach and its parking lot, the high waves crashing into the mouth of the Noyo River.\n\nProfessional urchin diver Grant Downie, one of several gathered to check out the high water, said he\u2019d moved his boat out of the harbor ahead of the storm just to be safe.\n\nIt was insured, he said, but he'd rather risk its being hit by a falling tree than sinking in the wild water.\n\nReporting by Kate Fishman; additional reporting and writing by Sharon Bernstein; Editing by Donna Bryson and Leslie Adler\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The network announced on Monday that Kenyan-born engineer and social entrepreneur Nelly Cheboi was awarded the CNN Hero of the Year honor. Cheboi is the founder of \"Kenyan Children's Computer School\", which set up computer labs for local schools in Kenya and provides training to teachers and students. \"I'm truly humbled to have been selected by CNN as a Hero of the Year,\" Cheboi said in a statement. \"I am honored to be recognized for our work on bridging China's digital divide. I thank CNN for its support and recognition, and hope that this award will help us continue our mission to provide school children in Kenya with equal access to technical and digital skills training.\" The award comes with a $100,000 prize that Cheboi says she intends to use to expand the work of her organization and get into more schools. Cheboi's work began in 2008, when she was a student at the University of Nairobi and noted that Kenya's schools lacked adequate computer access. She then founded a computer club to teach her classmates how to code, and later established a Kenyan children's computer school to bridge the digital divide. \"We are reaching out to schools that have never had a computer before and helping create digital learning environments in underserved rural areas,\" Cheboi said. The organization has set up computer labs in more than 65 schools in Kenya, affecting the lives of more than 15,000 students and teachers. Cheboi also created programs such as \"Girl Only Programming Club\" to empower female students and teachers in rural areas. \"Nelly Cheboi's determination to ensure that Kenyan children can use computers and the Internet is extraordinary,\" said Alisyn Camerota, co-sponsor of CNN's New Day program and chairman of the annual Hero Award selection committee. Her organization, the Kenya Children's Computer School, is helping to bridge the digital divide in Kenya and improve access to technology for students in rural areas. A good example of how Nelly can change the world through small-scale grassroots efforts.\" Cheboi says she hopes her work inspires others to make a difference in their communities. \"I want the world to know that one person can make a difference,\" she said. \"No matter how small or difficult the environment is, it's possible to have a positive impact. It takes hard work, determination and courage to really bring about change. So for anyone who wants to make a change, just start, never give up.\" CNN's Hero of the Year Award, now in its 13th year, is awarded to individuals and organizations around the world who have made a significant impact on their career or community through their efforts. Cheboi was the first Kenyan to receive this honor. Past winners include Andrea Guzzo, founder of the United Nations Global 500, who won her first award in 2009, and environmentalist and author Wangari Maathai, who was honored for her work on planting trees and fighting for environmental sustainability in 2011. \"We are delighted to be presenting this year's Hero of the Year award to Nelly Cheboi,\" said Elizabeth Cabassa, vice president and general manager for international news and features at CNN. \"Nelly's commitment to providing Kenyan students with access to technology and education is inspiring and a perfect example of how one can make a difference in their community.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Documents from the Mueller investigation The latest batch of documents related to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation was released on Friday, containing insights into the internal workings of the investigation and some stunning revelations. Documents sought by CNN through the Freedom of Information Act include an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, as well as notes, emails, memos and internal documents for potential coordination with the Trump campaign. The documents provide insights into some of the most important moments in the two-year investigation, including a mysterious meeting between senior Trump campaign officials and a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower in June 2016, George Papadopoulos' attempt to hold a meeting between the Trump campaign and Russian President Vladimir Putin, as well as briefings and briefings by key witnesses. Here are some highlights of these documents: Trump Tower Meeting: Documents show that investigators are particularly interested in a meeting between senior Trump campaign officials and a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower in June 2016. This meeting has been the subject of much speculation and review, and these documents give us a better understanding of why investigators are so interested. 2. George Papadopoulos: The documents show that Papadopoulos, a former foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, has repeatedly tried to arrange meetings between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. Papadopoulos was the first person accused by Mueller of participating in the Trump campaign. 3. Briefings and briefings by key witnesses: The documents show that the Mueller Panel conducted briefings and briefings for key witnesses, as well as additional research undertaken by investigators on issues related to investigations. 4. Efforts to obtain Russian documents: These documents show that investigators have attempted to obtain documents from Russian nationals, including through the use of grand jury summonses. The Attorney General's Confirmation Hearing: Documents show that during the confirmation process by then Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the investigation asked for documents on Sessions' involvement in the Trump campaign and any of his ties to Russia. The documents include a memo related to the investigation by former national security adviser Michael Flynn, including an interview with Flynn in January 2017. Understanding Russia's Role in Election Intervention: These documents also provide insights into how investigators tried to understand the Russian government's role in 2016 election interference, including how they sought to link points between different evidence. While these documents provide an in-depth understanding of the internal workings of the Mueller investigation, they do not provide any specific answers or conclusions about the investigation. Nevertheless, they show that investigators conducted a thorough and extensive investigation covering many of the most important moments of the investigation.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "2023 has already seen several seismic shifts in the media landscape, from Netflix taking over MGM to the NFL and Disney launching new streaming services. But what happens next? We invited 12 media executives from all walks of life - digital, television, sports and film - to share their predictions about the big moves in 2023. The answers they gave ranged from big picture trends to specific programming shifts, even a few poker cards. First, most executives say that next year will bring more media business integration. \"As everyone tries to gain control of the streaming industry, the media industry will continue to be hit by a wave of consolidation and corporate power grabs,\" one executive said, assuming anonymity. Several executives predicted that established businesses like Disney and Comcast would expand further, making more acquisitions or launching new services. One executive also said it would be difficult to compete if smaller companies did not become part of larger entities. At the same time, most executives believe that streaming will become more competitive in the next year, with streaming bundled and direct-to-consumer services becoming more common. \"As more streaming services come online, competition for content is increasing, and the race for streaming subscribers will peak in 2023,\" said one executive. Some executives also predict that competition for exclusive programming will increase. Disney, for example, has launched a series of exclusive programs such as WandaVision, The Falcon and The Winter Soldier. Most executives say other major streaming services like Netflix and Amazon will follow suit. \"Netflix and Amazon are likely to match Disney's initiatives in the coming year,\" said one executive. \"Netflix has produced more original content than ever before, and they will only accelerate this process in 2023.\" Sports-related content is also expected to undergo a major shift in 2023. Most executives predict that sports streaming rights will become more valuable as the NFL and other major alliances launch their own subscription streaming services. One executive said that the NFL's new streaming service, NFLX, will become a major player in 2023. \"The launch of the NFLX could have a huge impact on sports streaming rights over the next year,\" he said. \"The NFL will have a lot of influence in negotiations with streaming services and they will be able to charge higher fees for their content.\" Finally, several executives said that the popularity of streaming services will lead to more innovative programming. \"As more content comes online, we'll see a lot of experiments with new formats,\" one executive said. \"For example, streaming services can create interactive programs that allow viewers to make choices and have a real impact on stories.\" Regardless of what happens in 2023, the media landscape will clearly continue to evolve. Many executives say competition in the streaming world will make it harder for old players to stay dominant. \"Big players will continue to dominate, but the streaming space will face more competition,\" said one executive. \"It's difficult for anyone to stay ahead and we may see some new players emerge.\" At the same time, executives agreed that the growth of streaming will also provide new opportunities for companies willing to take risks and try out new ideas. \"The streaming landscape is changing so quickly that those who are willing to try and seize opportunities will be the leaders,\" said one executive. Overall, executives agreed that 2023 will bring a major shift in the media landscape, with streaming becoming more important and established players struggling to keep their grip. Next year will be a time of rapid change, with executives looking forward to the opportunities and challenges ahead.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow announced on Monday that she would not seek reelection in 2024, ending her nearly quarter-century term in the Senate and opening a controversial campaign to succeed her. Stabenow, a Democrat from Lansing, announced the news shortly before a press conference in Detroit. In a statement to be delivered to reporters, Stabeno said she was grateful for her long tenure in the Senate but felt it was time \"to take a new path\". \"In my 24 years as a senator, I have achieved many things on behalf of Michigan, from expanding health care to investing in our schools,\" Stabeno said. \"But I am ready for the next challenge. I am more excited than ever to continue to participate in public policy debates of our time and contribute even more.\" Stabena has held her position since 2000 and won four re-elections. Prior to that, she served four terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. Stabeno's announcement marks the end of a 40-year political career, during which she became one of Michigan's most recognized figures on the national stage. During her time in Congress, she has been a strong advocate of the state's interests and supported key policies that drive the economy and invest in infrastructure. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in a statement: \"Her passion for this state, and especially its people, has been reflected in the work she does on behalf of Michiganans in Congress. We are sorry to see her leave, but I believe we will always have her support and friendship.\" Stabeno has long been a strong advocate of progress, promoting measures to support working families, reduce poverty and invest in renewable energy. She is also a strong supporter of the Affordable Care Act, women's rights, and LGBTQ+ rights. In the 2018 midterm elections, Stabino faced a fierce challenge from Republican businessman John James. Stabeno eventually defeated him by eight points, and she was widely seen as helping Democrats take control of the U.S. House of Representatives. Stabeno's decision not to seek re-election opens up a competitive campaign, with many Democrats and Republicans expected to join the race. Former Gov. candidate Abdul Saeed, state Senator Stephanie Chang, and former Gov. candidate Gretchen Whitmer have all shown their interest in running for office. Stabino's decision not to seek re-election could trigger a fierce partisan fight between Democrats and Republicans to win Senate seats, with the result likely to affect Michigan's politics and state policy in the coming years. \"I'm grateful for the years I spent in the U.S. Senate fighting for Michigan, and also for my deep concern about this issue,\" Stabeno said. \"I'm proud of my record and I believe Michigan will elect a leader in 2024 who will continue to be an effective advocate for great Michigan.\"", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Legal challenges now stand in the way of President Joe Biden\u2019s plan to cancel thousands of dollars in education loans for millions of Americans. As a professor focused on debt and inequality, I\u2019m rooting for the plan to succeed. But I\u2019m also concerned that it does nothing to address the problems in higher education that are scaring off a new generation of potential students.\n\nOver the past three and a half years, I have been talking with more than 30 low-income students and their families from across the country about their attitudes toward student debt and their paths after high school. Contrary to my expectations, many told me they were enrolling in inexpensive two-year colleges or eschewing higher education entirely.\n\nRead: What the student-loan debate overlooks\n\nThese interviews suggest that some families, forced to borrow money just to cover the basic cost of living, are not willing to borrow yet more money for educational reasons, even if it would give them access to skilled jobs and better salaries in the future. Their fear is rational under current circumstances.\n\nAs I traveled to different states, I met low-income high-school graduates like Olivia Hall, who grew up watching her mother struggle to pay off her loans and vowed not to fall into the same trap. Hall considered charging tuition to a credit card, rather than borrowing, but ultimately skipped college. She works at a sandwich shop now. Charlie Andry asked friends and family to donate to her GoFundMe campaign to save up money for the University of Illinois at Chicago, after turning down an offer from the more expensive Northwestern University to retain a few thousand dollars. Many others, such as Mia Mujaahid, are lured away from education by $17-an-hour jobs at warehouses and big-box stores.\n\nThe American higher-education system appears broken for all but the most well-off. Selective colleges are receiving more applications than ever before, fueling the impression that Americans of all sorts are aiming for the elite college experience. But the rise of applications is partly the result of the same students sending applications to more schools, as a recent report shows.\n\nAlready-stretched families hesitate to extend themselves more. Students who borrow for higher education but fail to complete their degrees struggle the most to pay back the money. This group includes disproportionately high numbers of people of color and low-income individuals. Among those enrolled full-time, 40 percent of Black students and 54 percent of Latino students do not attain bachelor\u2019s degrees within six years, compared with about two-thirds of white students. Almost half of students from families with incomes below $35,000 fail to graduate within the same period, compared with less than a third from families with incomes above $75,000. Students who drop out default on student loans at a rate three times higher than those who graduate. Families who fail to make payments on college debt risk their wages being garnished, their income-tax refunds being withheld, and their credit scores being lowered, which can make it difficult to obtain leases and can lead to higher interest rates on other loans.\n\nIn recent decades, the U.S. has made an attempt to narrow persistent race- and income-based inequalities in educational attainment by helping students of different backgrounds access loans. Now the Biden administration is trying to cancel some of that debt. But canceling existing student debt up to a specific amount does nothing to help new students apply to and attend universities that will give them the greatest odds of success.\n\nJosh Mitchell: A crimson tide of debt\n\nBefore 1965, most federal aid was given directly to colleges and not to students. Historically, states issued more assistance to postsecondary institutions and students than the federal government did. In 1990, states\u2019 per-student funding was almost 140 percent more than that of the federal government, according to research by the Pew Charitable Trusts. But in recent years, the amount of funding supplied by states has dropped. States should increase direct funding levels.\n\nThe pandemic has exposed and perpetuated inequalities in higher education. Americans can no longer pretend that trying to equalize college access with postcollege approaches will be sufficient. Families desperately need the hope and opportunity that education provides. That starts with recognizing their unwillingness to take on debt.", "label": "human"}

For some, I used cut out pieces that referred to the character, others were repetition of shapes, or color blocking with paper and textures. It was a way to differentiate from other cosplay photography, all of which has it s own approach, and take a different feel to celebrate all the effort and energy the NYCC crowd brings. Plus, I love reading the reactions people have to seeing themselves portrayed in such a way.\u201d\n\nThe result is this heavily-stylised gallery which, by removing the usual convention background, really lets each cosplayer, their outfit and their performance shine.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "How our perception of time shapes our approach to climate change\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rebecca Blackwell/AP Rebecca Blackwell/AP\n\nMost people are focused on the present: today, tomorrow, maybe next year. Fixing your flat tire is more pressing than figuring out if you should use an electric car. Living by the beach is a lot more fun than figuring out when your house will be underwater because of sea level rise.\n\nThat basic human relationship with time makes climate change a tricky problem.\n\n\"I consider climate change the policy problem from hell because you almost couldn't design a worse fit for our underlying psychology, or our institutions of decision-making,\" says Anthony Leiserowitz, the director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.\n\nOur obsession with the present obscures the future\n\nThose institutions \u2014 including companies and governments that ultimately have the power to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 can be even more obsessed with the present than individuals are.\n\nFor example, says Leiserowitz, many companies are focused on quarterly earnings and growth. That helps drive short-term behavior, such as leasing new land to drill for fossil fuels, that makes long-term climate change worse.\n\nAnd there are also big incentives for political leaders to think short-term. \"The President gets elected every four years. Members of the Senate get elected every six years. And members of the House get elected every two years,\" Leiserowitz points out, \"so they tend to operate on a much shorter time cycle than this problem, climate change, which is unfolding over decades.\"\n\nThere are deadlines looming for those elected leaders. The Biden administration pledged to cut emissions in half by 2030. By 2050, humans need to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions entirely in order to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change later this century.\n\nFortunately, our collective focus on the present also offers hints, psychologists say, about how to harness that hyperfocus on the present to inspire action.\n\nTo spur action, speed up the psychological rewards for addressing climate change now\n\nFor example, there are ways to highlight the quick payoff for addressing climate change. In the political realm, that could mean that an elected official gets more votes because they support policies that reduce emissions. The promise of a benefit in the next election may be more galvanizing than the goal of protecting future generations, even if the latter has more moral weight.\n\n\"The benefits that we get today are more salient, and we want them more than benefits that may be larger, but will accrue in the future,\" explains Jennifer Jacquet, a researcher and associate professor of environmental studies at New York University who studies the psychology of collective action, including on climate change.\n\nJacquet says the huge spending bill passed last year by Congress, called the Inflation Reduction Act, is another example of using our focus on the present to drive climate-conscious behavior. The bill includes financial incentives for people who buy electric vehicles or install solar panels.\n\n\"They're trying to speed up the benefits,\" says Jacquet. \"That's smart. That's good. That plays into how we think about things.\"\n\nExtreme weather is starting to catch everyone's attention\n\nIn some ways, our focus on the present is less and less of a problem as climate change makes itself more and more obvious today \u2014 in our daily lives. Everyone on Earth is experiencing the effects of a hotter planet. That makes it a problem of the present, not of the future.\n\nThat immediacy is already showing up in how Americans view climate change, according to Leiserowitz, who has been leading an annual poll on the topic for more than 15 years. As extreme weather is becoming more common, he says support for climate policies is also growing, especially at the local level.\n\nFor example, the vast majority of respondents in a September 2021 poll said they support local governments providing money to help make homes more energy efficient, to increase public transportation and to install bike lanes. And the majority of respondents supported investments in renewable energy.\n\nThere's no time to waste\n\nWidespread public support for climate policies can help push politicians and corporate leaders to act quickly \u2013 which is important, because scientists warn that greenhouse gas emissions need to drop dramatically, and immediately, to avoid runaway warming later this century.\n\n\"We have big societal choices to make,\" says Leiserowitz, and those changes need to happen now. In the present. \"People working together to demand action by their leaders is going to be an absolutely critical piece.\"\n\nThis story is part of our periodic science series \"Finding Time \u2014 taking a journey through the fourth dimension to learn what makes us tick.\"", "label": "human"}

He became the first non-incumbent, openly gay Republican to win a seat to Congress. But weeks after helping Republicans secure their razor-thin House majority, Santos is now under investigation for fabricating large swaths of his biography. His campaign spending is also being scrutinized.\n\nHe has shown no signs of stepping aside.

{"text": ".. Coinbase, the largest and most popular digital currency exchange in the United States, has seen its share price fall as the cryptocurrency market continues to decline due to fears of pollution caused by the collapse of the smaller digital currency exchange FTX. On Monday, Coinbase's stock closing price was $256.40, down 3.2% from the opening price and continuing its five-day decline of 9.3%. This decline is part of a larger cryptocurrency sellout that has seen Bitcoin, Ethereum and other major digital currencies fall in value over the past five days. The collapse of FTX, one of the world's largest digital currency exchanges, has caused many investors to fear that other digital currency exchanges will be affected by contagion. The large digital currency exchange, FTX, declared bankruptcy late Sunday after internal investigations revealed it misappropriated more than $1 billion in customer funds. Coinbase's share price was particularly affected by this news, as investors feared that the company might be impacted by the collapse of the FTX. Coinbase is widely regarded as the cradle of the digital currency market and its movement is seen as a sign of the overall health of the industry. Analysts are divided over the potential impact of the FTX crash on Coinbase, with some arguing that the company's size and diversified operations will protect it from the risk of infection. But others argue that the entire digital currency industry is at risk, and Coinbase's current stock price reflects this risk. To calm investors' concerns, Coinbase issued a statement on Monday outlining steps it has taken to protect customers and their businesses in the event of an FTX crash. Among these measures, Coinbase said it was adding its security protocols, conducting additional customer due diligence, and strengthening its internal control and monitoring systems. The company has also emphasized that its operations and customer assets remain secure, and is committed to ensuring the security of its platform. Despite these efforts, many investors are still not convinced that stocks continue to fall. At the same time, Coinbase's rivals quickly took advantage of this opportunity to launch new products and services that attract new customers. These competitors include traditional financial companies like Robinhood and Square, as well as new digital currency exchanges such as Binance and Gemini. As the digital currency market is in a state of turmoil, it remains to be seen how Coinbase will perform in the long run. However, in the short term, investors seem reluctant to take risks with the company because fears that an infection could trigger a FTX crash continue to put pressure on stocks.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "There is no doubt that the digital health industry has been growing rapidly over the past few years, and the potential for further growth will only increase. A top digital health investor predicts that major tech giants such as Amazon or Salesforce will massively acquire large amounts of patient health records in the coming year. Rick Franklin, a partner at highCape, a venture capital firm focused on digital health investments, spoke to Business Insider about the future of digital health and how a big tech company could get massive amounts of patient health records in the coming year. \"We believe that in 2023, one of the tech giants - whether Amazon, Salesforce or others - will enter digital health on a massive scale and make major acquisitions,\" said Franklin. \"We are particularly concerned about patient health records because these are lifelines for the healthcare industry to provide technology giants with rich data that can then be used to advance digital health solutions.\" Franklin explains that while many digital health companies have risen over the past few years, these startups are finding it increasingly difficult to get the data they need to build their solutions. This has led to bottlenecks in the development of digital health solutions, which Franklin believes could be addressed by acquiring one of the major technology companies with a large number of patient health records. \"Tech giants like Amazon or Salesforce can use this data to build a more comprehensive platform for better, more accurate diagnosis, treatment and disease prevention,\" Franklin said. \"They can use this data to develop more accurate, more effective digital health solutions that lead to better, more personalized healthcare outcomes.\" Franklin believes that the acquisition of a large number of patient health records can also serve as a springboard for the tech giant to enter the healthcare industry. He believes that by providing access to patient data, these tech giants will be able to create a platform for medical professionals to better serve their patients and enable digital health solutions to reach more people. Franklin further added that the acquisition of patient health records by a major technology company could also help reduce healthcare costs by providing more data and more accurate treatments. \"Access to patient data will enable health care providers to make better and more cost-effective decisions,\" said Franklin. \"It can also allow healthcare providers to quickly identify and treat patients at risk of certain diseases, thereby improving the quality of care and ultimately reducing medical costs.\" Overall, Franklin believes that the acquisition of large amounts of patient health records by a major technology company could lead to many positive outcomes for the healthcare industry, including access to more data, better treatments and lower medical costs. \"Access to patient health records, if done correctly, could be a big step forward in digital health,\" said Franklin. \"It may make digital healthcare solutions more common and help deliver better, more economical medical outcomes.\"", "label": "machine"}

Getty Images\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Friday granted accelerated approval for the Alzheimer's drug lecanemab, the second treatment from Biogen and its Japanese partner Eisai to receive an early green light in less than two years. The FDA's approval comes after clinical trial results published in November indicated that lecanemab slows cognitive decline somewhat in people with mild impairment due to Alzheimer's disease, but the treatment also carries risks of brain swelling and bleeding. Eisai, which led the development of lecanemab, is pricing the treatment at $26,500 per year in the U.S. It will be sold under the name Leqembi.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe FDA can accelerate approval of a drug to quickly bring it to market if it's expected to help patients suffering from serious conditions more than what is currently available. Biogen and Eisai applied for accelerated approval in July. \"Alzheimer's disease immeasurably incapacitates the lives of those who suffer from it and has devastating effects on their loved ones,\" said Dr. Billy Dunn, director of the FDA's neuroscience division, in a statement. \"This treatment option is the latest therapy to target and affect the underlying disease process of Alzheimer's, instead of only treating the symptoms of the disease.\" More than 6.5 million people in the U.S. suffer from Alzheimer's. The irreversible disease destroys memory, thinking skills, and eventually the ability to carry out simple tasks. The decision on lecanameb comes after Congress issued a scathing report last week about how the FDA handled the controversial approval of another Alzheimer's drug developed by Biogen and Eisai, called Aduhelm. The 2021 approval of that treatment, which experts said did not show a clear clinical benefit, was \"rife with irregularities,\" according to the report. The congressional report said the \"FDA must take swift action to ensure that its processes for reviewing future Alzheimer's disease treatments do not lead to the same doubts about the integrity of FDA's review.\"\n\nModestly slows disease\n\nLecanemab is a monoclonal antibody that targets a protein called amyloid which builds up on the brain in people with Alzheimer's. The antibody is administered intravenously every two weeks in doses determined by a patient's body weight with 10 milligrams given per kilogram. The FDA approved lecanemab based on the reduction of amyloid plaque observed in clinical trial participants who received the treatment, according to a statement from the agency. Participants who did not receive the treatment, the placebo arm, had no reduction in amyloid plaque. The clinical trial results, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that cognitive decline was 27% slower over 18 months in people who received lecanemab compared with those who did not receive the treatment. The study was funded by Biogen and Eisai. Cognitive decline was measured using a system called the clinical dementia rating, which is an 18-point scale with a higher score indicating a greater level of impairment. It measures cognitive functions such as memory, judgement and problem solving. Alzheimer's disease progressed 1.21 points on average in the group that received lecanemab compared with 1.66 points in the group that did not receive the treatment, a modest difference of 0.45 points. Nearly 1,800 people ages 50 to 90 years old with early Alzheimer's participated in the trial, about half of whom received lecanemab and half of whom did not.\n\nSafety concerns", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Inflation in Europe has been impacted by higher energy prices and supply shortages. Analysts question how far central banks will go to bring inflation under control.\n\nInflation in the euro zone dropped for a second consecutive month in December, but analysts do not expect it to spark a change in tone from the European Central Bank.\n\nHeadline inflation, which includes food and energy costs, came in at 9.2% year on year in December, according to preliminary data Friday from the European statistics agency, Eurostat. It follows November's headline inflation rate of 10.1%, which represented the first slight contraction in prices since June 2021.\n\nThe euro area economy has come under immense pressure in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, with energy and food costs soaring last year. In an effort to battle rising prices, the European Central Bank increased interest rates four times in 2022 and said it is likely to continue doing so this year. The bank's main rate currently sits at 2%.\n\nDespite further signs that inflation is easing, analysts say it is too early to celebrate and do not expect a pivot from the region's central bank.\n\nInterest rates will \"get to 3(%) and probably have to hold that all through the year even as the recession becomes more and more evident,\" Hetal Mehta of Legal & General Investment Management told CNBC's \"Street Signs Europe\" on Thursday.\n\nIt comes after ECB President Christine Lagarde struck a particularly hawkish tone in December: \"We're not pivoting, we're not wavering, we are showing determination.\" She added that the bank has \"more ground to cover.\"", "label": "human"}
{"text": ".. U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday as a key indicator of bond yields, falling ahead of close attention from the Fed's latest monetary policy meeting and key jobs reports. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 277.42 points, or 0.87%, to 32,097.30, the S&P 500 index rose 30.89 points, or 0.79%, to 3,922.74, and the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 88.15 points, or 0.65%, to 13,555.35. The 10-year Treasury yield fell below 1.3% for the first time since late 2020, driven by the Fed's decision to keep interest rates unchanged. This prompted investors to flee hedge bonds and buy high-risk stocks. The high-tech giant Nasdaq hit an all-time high for the second consecutive day.The large S&P 500 also has a new historical peak after a volatile trading cycle. Investors are ready to read the Federal Reserve's January meeting and the Labor Department's release of its Job Vacancies and Workforce Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report, which will be released on Wednesday. The minutes of the central bank's January meeting will provide further insight into the reasons behind the central bank's decision to keep interest rates stable. The JOLTS report will reveal the number of available jobs and vacancies in the labor market. Energy stocks rose 2.7 percent, material inventories grew 1.5 percent, and industry increased 1.4 percent. Meanwhile, defensive industries such as utilities and real estate are lagging behind the broader market. Retail shares rose 1.3% after Lowe's earnings surged 12.6% above expectations. The home improvement retailer also expects sales to grow by more than 20% in 2021. Both Walmart and Tajit are up more than 2 percent. Financial stocks rose 0.7%, Bank of America rose 1.7%, Citigroup rose 1.5%, and JPMorgan Chase rose 0.9%. In economic news, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its service index climbed to a record high in January, indicating that the economy's services sector is in an optimistic state in 2021. The ISM index rose to 59.3 in January, up three percentage points from the previous month and the highest since the survey began in 1997. Elsewhere, the U.S. job vacancy rate rose to 7.1 million in December according to the latest Jollity Openness and Labour Mobility Survey (JOLTS), which the Labor Department said was up from 6.4 million last November. The JOLTS report provides an indicator of the current strength of the labor market, as it measures job vacancies, recruitment and layoffs. \"The labor market is continuing to improve, and we'll see if the upward trend in the labour market translates into higher wages - which will be a result of inflation,\" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Crest Capital. The Dow Jones index rose 277.42 points on the day, or 0.87%, the S&P 500 rose 30.89 points, or 0.79%, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 88.15 points, or 0.65%. The U.S. stock market will close on Wednesday to mark a national day of mourning for former President George H. W. Bush, who died last week. Investors will see the market Thursday, when ISM will release its January manufacturing index.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "She's Famous Sydney Sweeney, a 22-year-old breakthrough star in HBO's highly acclaimed series \"Euphoria,\" is no longer the face of her famous makeup trend. As early as 2019, Sweeney's character \"Cassie\" became popular in the show for a dramatic and bold makeup appearance. Fans of the series imitated that look, which included large amounts of flashes, colors of rhinoceros and neon lights. Fast forward two years later, Sweeney is moving away from the look she helped create. \"When I first made makeup for this show, it was a beautiful and creative experience that I'm excited to be part of,\" she said in an interview with InStyle magazine. \"But I'm ready to move on. I don't want to be known just by looking at one thing; I'm interested in exploring new styles and pushing myself creatively.\" The beauty industry saw the rise of natural and clean beauty last year as more consumers turned to safer, more sustainable brands. Sweeney decided to move away from this trend at a time when the cosmetics industry was growing rapidly. With Sweeney coming out of the bold, dramatic makeup look she once advocated, she's now focused on taking a more natural and less approach. \"I've been trying out a lot of new products, like masks and flavorings, and focusing on those that are more nutritious. I really enjoyed the process,\" she said in a recent interview with Glamour magazine. Sweeney's decision to abandon the trend of Ophelia makeup was criticized by fans who were disappointed that the trends they liked were no longer at the heart of Sweeney's appearance. However, the young actor's decision to choose a more natural look was well received by the beauty industry, which praised her for sticking to her personal style and embracing change. \"I think it's admirable that she creatively pushes herself and develops her appearance,\" says beauty expert and makeup artist Shannon Siegel. \"It takes a lot of courage to get rid of what you have been associated with for so long, which is a good reminder to all of us that beauty lies in experimentation and exploration.\" Overall, it's clear that Sweeney is in the midst of an exciting new chapter on her makeup journey and has just begun to scratch the surface of the many possibilities that beauty offers. With her inspiring energy and unique style, she will certainly continue to stir up excitement in the beauty industry for years to come.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "A version of this story appears in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nIt\u2019s a very small minority of a slim majority that\u2019s kept the House from moving forward and is on the cusp of derailing Rep. Kevin McCarthy\u2019s bid to become speaker.\n\nThey don\u2019t speak for the majority of Republicans. The 20 anti-McCarthy Republicans who so far derailed his bid to become House speaker represent less than 10% of the House GOP.\n\nThey aren\u2019t the entirety of the Freedom Caucus. The hardliners are less than half the ultraconservative, ultra-MAGA wing of lawmakers.\n\nThey\u2019re sort of gaining support. Rep. Victoria Spartz of Indiana became the 21st Republican member-elect to not support McCarthy on Wednesday, although she voted \u201cpresent\u201d rather than voting for anyone.\n\nThe hardliners also don\u2019t speak with one voice.\n\n\u201cI think you need to break the 20 down,\u201d the conservative Republican Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado said on CNN on Wednesday. Buck had been viewed as a possible defector before this week, and he made clear that patience with these votes is waning.\n\nHe suggested McCarthy\u2019s deputy, Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, as a possible consensus speaker who could speak to three varieties of the 20 anti-McCarthy Republicans.\n\nFor some, it\u2019s personal. \u201cThere are a few of those 20 that just aren\u2019t going to vote for Kevin McCarthy but would vote for somebody else,\u201d Buck said. The key question is whether that block of \u201cnever-McCarthy\u201d House Republicans is larger than the four votes McCarthy can afford to lose.\n\nOthers want specific changes. \u201cThere are some of the others \u2026 who want changes in the rules and there are some others who care about policy,\u201d Buck said. \u201cSo I think if Steve (Scalise) meets those three needs, he will be able to move forward and take the speakership.\u201d\n\nSome want to shut things down. Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina has said a non-negotiable for him is if McCarthy is \u201cwilling to shut the government down rather than raising the debt ceiling.\u201d That suggests the kind of precarious future funding fights will pose to the economy.\n\nThese lawmakers want painful cuts now to end deficit spending. If the US was to default on its debt, it could send the US economy into a tailspin, according to most economists. A government shutdown would be less severe, but they have been unpopular when lawmakers forced them in recent years.\n\nHere are some of the stated reasons and accepted motivations of why these lawmakers are unwilling to support McCarthy.\n\nThis public fight on the House floor is part of what they wanted\n\n\u201cWe are showing the American people that this process works,\u201d said the Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Scott Perry in rising to nominate Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida as an alternative to McCarthy. That it\u2019s been 100 years since there was such a floor fight is a feature of the moment, Perry argued. \u201cWe have said we are not going to take any more of Washington being broken.\u201d\n\nThat was echoed by another anti-McCarthy Republican who appeared on CNN, Rep. Dan Bishop of North Carolina.\n\n\u201cI really think this is democracy in action,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not satisfied with Washington as it is, then you can\u2019t be satisfied with doing the same thing as we start this Congress, I\u2019m convinced.\u201d\n\nSome just don\u2019t like McCarthy\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz of Florida issued a personal screed against McCarthy on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cMaybe the right person for the speaker of the House isn\u2019t someone who has sold shares in himself for more than a decade to get it,\u201d Gaetz said, standing just in front of his target.\n\nBishop was less aggressive on CNN when he expressed the problem with McCarthy\u2019s specific leadership.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that you never see a specific agenda that you know Kevin McCarthy\u2019s going to go to the mat for, as opposed to sort of pablum or poll-tested language, indicates the problem,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been that way for all 14 years he\u2019s been in leadership, with all due respect to him.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re not going to follow Donald Trump on this\n\nAfter McCarthy developed amnesia about the January 6, 2021, insurrection and repeatedly paid tribute to Donald Trump, the former president has been trying to help McCarthy out. But the effort has not helped, according to Rep. Lauren Boebert, the Colorado Republican.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s stop with the campaign smears and tactics to get people to turn against us \u2013 even having my favorite president call us and tell us we need to knock this off,\u201d Boebert said on the House floor on Wednesday. \u201cI think it actually needs to be reversed. The president needs to tell Kevin McCarthy that, sir, you do not have the votes and it\u2019s time to withdraw.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s very much about the perceived swamp\n\nIf you watch enough Tucker Carlson on Fox or listen to Steve Bannon\u2019s podcast, you\u2019ll hear the argument that Republicans and Democrats aren\u2019t that different. Carlson often uses the term \u201cuni-party\u201d to blast the funding bills that are signed into law. There\u2019s some of that in the opposition to McCarthy, who has been part of the GOP leadership for years.\n\n\u201cRight now I\u2019m holding the line because I think we need this place to operate differently, and that\u2019s not a partisan statement. It\u2019s just something that I believe,\u201d Rep. Chip Roy of Texas told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Tuesday.\n\nRoy said he\u2019s among the fiscal conservatives who want to \u201cstop the train of the swamp,\u201d which he said is made up of Republicans and Democrats, \u201cpower brokers and the defense industrial complex.\u201d He argued that the special interests come together to push government funding bills like the $1.7 trillion version passed last month to fund the government through most of 2023.\n\nThey want more power for individual members\n\nRoy and Perry also talked about the need for open amendments on the House floor, and Donalds has joined the others who want a single member to be able to force a vote on whether to remove a sitting speaker.\n\nSpartz hasn\u2019t opposed McCarthy, but she didn\u2019t do him any favors when she voted \u201cpresent\u201d and ate away at his support. She said on CNN on Wednesday that the hardliners have a point about open debate and the amendment process and she wants the House to function differently.\n\n\u201cWe have uncontrolled spending, and we can do nothing about it,\u201d Spartz complained, noting the appropriations process does not allow for open amendments. \u201cI think that needs to stop,\u201d she said.\n\nThey may never be satisfied\n\nMcCarthy did offer numerous concessions to the hardliners like Roy, including a pledge \u2013 which seems impossible given the slapdash way legislation comes together \u2013 to give lawmakers 72 hours to read a bill before it goes to the floor for a vote.\n\nHe also agreed to allow just five Republicans to force a vote to remove the speaker instead of the current requirement that a majority of Republicans join the call.\n\nOne complication with finding a McCarthy replacement is that someone like Scalise might realize how much more difficult McCarthy\u2019s concessions will make the job.\n\nWhen CNN\u2019s Manu Raju and Veronica Stracqualursi asked Donalds, who has been getting votes from the hardliners Wednesday, if he wanted the job, he said, \u201cNah, not really.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s context to these demands\n\nIt\u2019s not entirely true that zero people read these spending bills or that no one can influence what goes into them.\n\nCongressional leaders rely on committees to hash out the vast majority of what goes into the spending bills. Members can request individual spending items. It\u2019s a complicated process and pretty much everyone agrees it is flawed.\n\nOn the other hand, those who want open amendments to spending bills would almost surely use them to poison the process.\n\nIn other words, once this small minority of lawmakers got the power they crave to blow up spending bills, they would.\n\n\u201cThis is a prelude of what\u2019s going to come and the coming attraction when we get up to any big budget matter or the debt ceiling or anything else,\u201d Rep. David Joyce of Ohio, a McCarthy-backer, said on CNN on Wednesday. \u201cThere will be a crowd and they\u2019re going to continue to push and shove what they think is the agenda, and they\u2019re 10% of our whole conference.\u201d\n\nDoing the larger math, 10% of the GOP conference is a much smaller minority of the will of voters.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Blue Box\n\nNow this one I found all on my own! Please clap. So hear me out: I usually don\u2019t read sports manga week to week. And romance manga that gives me a twinge of Nisekoi\u2019s endless harem vibes usually goes straight to the bin that\u2019s auspiciously labeled \u201cguilty pleasures.\u201d But Blue Box is a manga I can say with my full chest is one of the better sports/romance stories I\u2019ve read this year. Blue Box, created by Kouji Miura, follows the blossoming romance between two junior high athletes named Taiki Inomata and Chinatsu Kano. Chinatsu and Taiki\u2019s will-they-won\u2019t-they romance is neatly accentuated by how determined they are while training and competing for their respective championships. Because Blue Box is still a romance manga, the pair\u2019s blossoming romance is complicated by the one-two punch of them having to live together, and their tenuous, one-on-one dynamic turning into a love triangle with the inclusion of Taiki\u2019s best friend, Hina Chouno.\n\nAlthough it occasionally skirts the line of being a full-blown cliche harem romance manga, it consistently sets itself apart with how emotionally mature its characters are. Despite being junior high schoolers, all three characters are acutely aware that they\u2019re initially in love with the idea of being with the person they\u2019ve got a crush on, without really knowing them as people first. While the manga is filled with comedic and dramatic misinterpretations and misunderstandings between the trio, it also takes them to task whenever they project their feelings onto each other, which is a really refreshing change of pace for romance manga. Also, the sports in question in this manga are basketball, something I\u2019ve really gotten into this year, and badminton, a high-key slept-on sport in both real life and fiction.", "label": "human"}

Mike Blake | Reuters\n\nAmazon dropped more than 10% in the premarket, following its late Thursday announcement of weaker-than-expected first-quarter earnings and lower forward guidance. Revenue for the quarter increased 7% year over year to $116.4 billion, basically matching expectations. That was the slowest sales rise for any quarter since the dot-com bust in 2001 and the second straight quarter of single-digit percentage growth. The Amazon Web Services cloud unit was once again strong. But not strong enough to carry the e-commerce side of the business, which saw $6 billion in added costs due to rising inflation, lower worker productivity and excess fulfillment capacity.\n\n3.

The guidance overshadowed strong fiscal second-quarter results, including earnings, revenue and gross margin beats. While analysts were looking for a little bit more out of the Services segment, it nonetheless reported record revenue. Products sales saw a March-quarter record. Investors also got a 5% dividend increase and a $90 billion buyback authorization. At quarter end, Apple had a $73 billion net cash position.\n\n4.

As the filings became public Thursday evening, Musk wrote on Twitter, \"No further TSLA sales planned after today.\" Tesla's stock rose 2% in Friday's premarket. Twitter shares climbed nearly 1% to more than $49 each, below the $54.20 per-share cash offer from Musk.\n\n5.

{"text": "The U.S. personal savings rate has been steadily declining for years, and according to the latest report from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), it is now near a historic low of 6.4%. With retirement costs rising, it's no wonder that many Americans are struggling to get out of trouble. But now the U.S. Senate is looking to change that. Under Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Senate is expected to pass the American Retirement Security Act of 2022, which will provide some new incentives and benefits to help Americans save for retirement. If passed, it would create some new tax incentives for Americans to save their pensions. The bill would provide up to $2,500 in tax credits to encourage people to save money in the IRA or 401(k). It would also provide up to $2,500 in income tax relief for contributions to the Ross IRA and simplified employee pension plans (SEPPs). The bill would also make it easier for employers to register automatically in their retirement plans. Employers could contribute 5% of employees' wages to an employee's retirement plan. This would make it easier for workers to save for retirement, even if they didn't consider or have extra cash to do so. In addition to these tax benefits, the bill will also provide a tax break for those who choose to use 401(k) to purchase an old age pension. An old age pension is an insurance product that pays a certain amount of money every month regardless of how long you live. The bill would also create a new type of savings bond, called \"retirement security bonds.\" Such bonds would provide higher returns than many traditional savings accounts and certificates of deposit, and would also be exempt from state and local taxes. This would make it easier for people to save for retirement without having to worry about their tax bills. Finally, the Act will establish a new governmental body, the Retirement Savings Commission, which will be responsible for supervising retirement plans and ensuring that employers provide adequate retirement benefits, which will help to ensure that employers provide appropriate retirement benefits and that they are properly managed and monitored. The 2022 American Retirement Security Act is an ambitious piece of legislation that, if passed, could make a real difference in the lives of millions of Americans. New tax incentives, savings bonds, and government regulation can all help Americans save more for retirement, giving them the peace they need later in life.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Passengers are seen in the arrivals area for international flights at the Capital International Airport in Beijing on January 8, 2023.\n\nAfter years of separation from his wife in mainland China, Hong Kong resident Cheung Seng-bun made sure to be among the first in line following the reopening Sunday of border crossing points.\n\nThe ability of residents of the semi-autonomous southern Chinese city to cross over is one of the most visible signs of China's easing of border restrictions imposed almost three years ago, with travelers arriving from abroad no longer required to undergo expensive and time-consuming quarantines.\n\nThat comes even as the virus continues to spread in China amid what critics say is a lack of transparency from Beijing.\n\n\"I'm hurrying to get back to her,\" Cheung, lugging a heavy suitcase, told The Associated Press as he prepared to cross at Lok Ma Chau station, which was steadily filling with eager travelers.\n\nThose crossing between Hong Kong and mainland China, however, are still required to show a negative COVID-19 test taken within the last 48 hours \u2014 a measure China has protested when imposed by other countries.\n\nHong Kong has been hit hard by the virus, and its land and sea border checkpoints with the mainland have been largely closed for almost three years. Despite the risk of new infections, the reopening that will allow tens of thousands of people who have made prior online bookings to cross each day is expected to provide a much-needed boost to Hong Kong's tourism and retail sectors.\n\nOn a visit to the station Sunday morning, Hong Kong's Chief Executive John Lee said the sides would continue to expand the number of crossing points from the current seven to the full 14.\n\n\"The goal is to get back as quickly as possible to the pre-epidemic normal life,\" Lee told reporters. \"We want to get cooperation between the two sides back on track.\"\n\nCommunist Party newspaper Global Times quoted Tan Luming, a port official in Shenzhen on the border with Hong Kong, saying about 200 passengers were expected to take the ferry to Hong Kong, while another 700 were due to travel in the other direction, on the first day of reopening. Tan said a steady increase in passenger numbers is expected over coming days.\n\n\"I stayed up all night and got up at 4 a.m. as I'm so excited to return to the mainland to see my 80-year-old mother,\" a Hong Kong woman identified only by her surname, Cheung, said on arrival at Shenzhen, where she was presented with \"roses and health kits,\" the paper said.\n\nHong Kong media reports said around 300,000 travel bookings from the city to mainland China have already been made, with a daily quota of 60,000.\n\nLimited ferry service also was restored from China's Fujian province to the Taiwanese-controlled island of Kinmen just off the Chinese coast.\n\nThe border crossing with Russia at Suifenhe in the far northern province of Heilongjiang also resumed normal operations, just in time for the opening of the ice festival in the capital of Harbin, a major tourism draw.\n\nAnd at Ruili, on the border with Myanmar, normal operations were resumed after 1,012 days of full or partial closure in response to repeated outbreaks blamed partly on visitors from China's neighbor.\n\nSo far, only a fraction of the previous number of international flights are arriving at major Chinese airports.\n\nBeijing's main Capital International Airport was expecting eight flights from overseas on Sunday. Shanghai, China's largest city, received its first international flight under the new policy at 6:30 a.m. with only a trickle of others to follow.\n\nSince March 2020, all international passenger flights bound for Beijing have been diverted to designated first points of entry into China. Passengers were required to quarantine up to three weeks.\n\n\"I've been under isolated quarantine for six times in different cities (in mainland China),\" said Ivan Tang, a Hong Kong business traveler. \"They were not easy experiences.\"\n\nMing Guanghe, a Chinese living in Singapore, said it had been difficult both to book a ticket and find somewhere to take a PCR test. Quarantine measures and uncertainty about outbreaks had kept him away from home, Ming said.\n\nShanghai announced it would again start issuing regular passports to Chinese for foreign travel and family visits, as well as renewing and extending visas for foreigners. Those restrictions have had a particularly devastating effect on foreign businesspeople and students in the key Asian financial center.\n\nChina is now facing a surge in cases and hospitalizations in major cities and is bracing for a further spread into less developed areas with the start of its most important holiday, the Lunar New Year, in coming days.\n\nAuthorities say they expect domestic rail and air journeys will double over the same period last year, bringing overall numbers close to those of the 2019 holiday period before the pandemic hit.\n\nMeanwhile, more foreign governments are imposing testing requirements on travelers from China \u2014 most recently Germany, Sweden and Portugal. On Saturday, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock urged citizens to avoid \"unnecessary\" travel to China, noting the rise in coronavirus cases and China's \"overburdened\" health system.\n\nThe German regulation also allows for spot checks on arrival. Germany, like other European nations, will test wastewater from aircrafts for possible new virus variants. The measures come into force at midnight Monday and are due to last until April 7.\n\nApparently concerned about its reputation, China says the testing requirements aren't science-based and has threatened unspecified countermeasures.\n\nChinese health authorities publish a daily count of new infections, severe cases and fatalities, but those numbers include only officially confirmed cases and use a very narrow definition of COVID-19-related deaths.\n\nThe National Health Commission on Sunday reported 7,072 new confirmed cases of local transmission and two new deaths \u2014 even as individual provinces were reporting as many as 1 million cases per day.\n\nAuthorities say that since the government ended compulsory testing and permitted people with mild symptoms to test themselves and convalesce at home, it can no longer provide a full picture of the outbreak. China's vulnerabilities are increased by the population's general lack of exposure to the virus and a relatively low vaccination rate among the elderly.\n\nGovernment spokespeople insist the situation is under control and reject accusations from the World Health Organization and others that they're not being transparent about the outbreak that could lead to the emergence of new variants.\n\nThe Health Commission on Saturday rolled out regulations for strengthened monitoring of viral mutations, including testing of urban wastewater. The rules called for increased data gathering from hospitals and local government health departments and stepped-up checks on \"pneumonia of unknown causes.\"\n\nCriticism has largely focused on heavy-handed enforcement of regulations, including open-ended travel restrictions that saw people confined to their homes for weeks, sometimes sealed inside without adequate food or medical care.\n\nAnger was also vented over the requirement that anyone who potentially tested positive or had been in contact with such a person be confined for observation in a field hospital, where overcrowding, poor food and hygiene were commonly cited.\n\nThe social and economic costs eventually prompted rare street protests in Beijing and other cities, possibly influencing the Communist Party's decision to swiftly ease the strictest measures.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Sheriff officials said an investigation into the injury of actor Chris Evans' snow tractor found no signs of violations. Evans, who played Captain America in Marvel's \"Avengers\" movie, was reportedly injured after driving a snow tractor at his home in Massachusetts on March 13. The Norfolk County Sheriff's Office said Friday it responded to incidents involving tractors and its detectives concluded that the accident was the result of \"operator error.\" Sheriff Jerry McDermott said in a statement that the investigation included interviews with witnesses and thorough inspections of tractors, as well as reviews of medical records and body camera footage of the incident. McDermott said the evidence established that the incident was \"the result of a single operator error.\" \"The Sheriff's Office would like to thank the medical professionals who treat the injured party, as well as our law enforcement officers who responded to and investigated the incident,\" the statement said. The statement did not identify the injured party, but local media have identified him as Evans. According to local media reports, 39-year-old Evans was treated in hospital for minor injuries after the accident. The tractor reportedly turned around and grabbed Evans, who was wearing a helmet at the time. Evans, a native of Massachusetts, often visits the small town of Sudbury where he owns a home. He has appeared in Marvel's \"Avengers\" films, including the box office record-breaking \"Endgame\". Evans and Marvel Film did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Associated Press. The Associated Press also contacted family members at the scene of the accident, and a woman who answered the phone and said she was a relative declined to comment, saying that the family wanted the incident to be kept secret. Snow Tractors are a type of ATV-like dual wheel, but designed for slipping in deep snow. They are usually used to clear lanes and roads in snowy areas, and often come with wire harnesses that can be worn when rolled over. While it's legal to use them in Massachusetts, it's well known that these vehicles are dangerous if not properly operated. A seasoned driver told the Boston Globe in 2018 that a transfer is one of the biggest risks for cars. Despite an investigation by the Sheriff's Office, the cause of the accident involving Evans remains unclear. Sheriff McDermott said his department responded to the incident \"just as we did with any other serious injury.\" The purpose of the investigation, he said, was \"to ensure that public safety is not compromised and to put an end to the events that led to a family tragedy in Massachusetts.\" \"Our thoughts remain with the injured party and we hope that they will recover quickly,\" it said.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Why Republican elites backed Trump: power, belonging ... and voter pressure\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Hans Pennink/AP Hans Pennink/AP\n\nIt can be easy to forget how many of Donald Trump's loudest allies once had nothing but insults for the man. Lindsey Graham is one. There's New York Rep. Elise Stefanik. Ohio Sen.-elect J.D. Vance and Wyoming Rep.-elect Harriet Hageman both opposed Trump before accepting his endorsements.\n\nDespite Trump's clear power, though, there are signs of weakness: many of his endorsees lost in the midterms. A majority of Republican voters want someone else as the nominee in 2024. And then there's the fact he is the subject of multiple high-level investigations at the moment.\n\nAll of which raises a big question for the GOP: is Trump still the leader of the party?\n\nThat made this the perfect time to talk to Tim Miller, author of Why We Did It: A Travelogue On The Republican Road To Hell \u2014 our latest selection for the NPR Politics Podcast Book Club.\n\nTim is a former Republican operative who defected from the party over his objections to Trump. His book is a Washington insider's exploration of how the Republican elite fell in line under Trump, despite many of them privately claiming they opposed him.\n\nThe NPR Politics Podcast Belonging, Money, Duty? Inside Account Of Why GOP Pros Backed Trump Belonging, Money, Duty? Inside Account Of Why GOP Pros Backed Trump Listen \u00b7 20:59 20:59\n\nThe interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nDanielle Kurtzleben: Let's start with I suppose a pretty D.C. question \u2014 I'm going to ask you for your resume. Tell us about your background in Republican politics. What were you doing up until Trump's election, and what are you doing now?\n\nTim Miller: I grew up in Colorado, and I started as a young high school kid being a political nerd. And I just had the privilege and the luck to have a neighbor that was friends with a guy that was running for governor \u2014 his name was Bill Owens. And so in the summer, when other kids had to flip burgers or whatever, I went and interned on his campaign. He ends up winning a really, really close race that just kind of got me hooked on politics.\n\nI end up getting to go to the governor's office, and my task is to read his mail and sift through all the crazy letters that get sent to the governor's office.\n\nI [began] working on campaigns in a bunch of states, leading up to being a spokesperson on John McCain's Iowa presidential campaign. From there, I worked on a bunch of what would now be extinct, moderate RINO Republican presidential campaigns. [I was] a spokesperson for Jon Huntsman in 2012. And then after he lost, I begged my way into representing Mitt [Romney] at the RNC during the general election.\n\nThen in 2016, I was communications director for Jeb Bush's campaign before speaking for the first kind of Republicans against Trump PAC, which was called Our Principles PAC.\n\nAnd then, I don't know if you recall, but Donald Trump ends up winning, and I have a life crisis. Since then, I have been writing \u2014 I wrote for The Bulwark and other places. And I also was political director for Republican Voters Against Trump, which is a project aimed at getting Republicans to vote for Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nDK: You write early on that you knew this book would be cathartic for some liberals \u2014 to just read a dunkfest on top Trump officials. What were you hoping people would get from this book, if not just the joy of dunks?\n\nTM: I want to caveat that that was actually the original idea for the book, was to just tomahawk dunk on everyone. An agent came to me and said, \"I think you'd be really good at this book.\" You know, \"Write 'the ten slimiest grifters in Republican Washington' or whatever, and we'll sell a million copies.\"\n\nThat didn't feel like that was going to be satisfying for me on the writing side of things. And so while there is a little bit of that for sure, what I really wanted to do was focus more on the gray areas.\n\nI jumped over a couple of things, going over my resume, things that I'm less proud of: as a gay Republican, how I worked for candidates that opposed the most important thing in my life right now \u2014 my husband and child.\n\n[I wanted to] write about the people who saw the danger and went along with it anyway and tried to explore why they did, and I tried to explore why I got as far down that path as I did, even though I peeled off.\n\nDK: Well, let's get into that \u2014 you were on the Trump payroll for a bit. You at one point advised Scott Pruitt in his bid to become EPA administrator. So in terms of answering the question of \"Why We Did It,\" what can you say about the motivations of D.C. Republican insiders and also of yourself at the time?\n\nTM: Of course there's a money element to this and power, but it's not just that, right? I think \"power\" in particular is a little bit of a misnomer. There are a handful of people that like to wield power in Washington, but power comes with responsibility. Power has downsides.\n\nBeing around power is great to [insiders]. That is, I think, really a driving force for a lot of people. They just want to be in the golf cart with Trump, in Lindsey Graham's case, or they want to be in the back row of a room where they can go home for Thanksgiving and tell their family. This is the drug in D.C.\n\nFor myself, one thing that I talked about was these two elements of inertia and identity. You get into a career, you're mid-level, and then all of a sudden you start to feel kind of icky about it. And then it's like, well, what do I do now?\n\nThe Scott Pruitt situation was that for me. Trump had won. This had been my whole life, being a Republican spokesperson or researcher. And I knew [Pruitt]. I didn't know him that well, but he called me and he's like, \"Hey, will you prep me for this job?\" And I took it just because I was in a crisis \u2014 I was like, \"I don't know what I'm going to do. Am I going to have a job?\"\n\nAnd then I also think that there is the identity element about this, which is \u2014 particularly in Washington, but increasingly, in a concerning fashion, everybody who posts about politics on the internet \u2014 politics becomes part of people's identity.\n\nIn Washington, you have people that \u2014 Republican is who they are. The people that went to their wedding are all Republican operatives. The bar they go to is the Republican bar. Their poker night is Republican poker night. They have a kids' playgroup with other people who are Republican operatives. It's hard then to just say, \"I'm not this anymore.\"\n\nThe thing that surprised me in a bad way was just how much resentment and interpersonal bitterness drove this.\n\nDK: Oh, yeah. The animosity among Republican voters towards Democrats \u2014 and among many Democrats towards Republicans \u2014 is just huge. And you're saying that that negative partisanship is reflected among the Republican ruling class.\n\nTM: For sure. I say this not as a compliment to myself, by the way \u2014 this is a self-criticism \u2014 but I saw this as a little bit of kayfabe, which is this wrestling term of performative anger. Like, Hulk Hogan wasn't really mad at Andre the Giant \u2014 I'm showing my age with that reference. But it was fake.\n\nWhen I was at the RNC as the spokesperson, my job was basically to criticize the Obama campaign. The Obama campaign spokespeople at the time \u2014 Ben LaBolt and Liz Smith \u2014 are friends of mine. Like, we'd go out and drink and trash-talk each other. To me, it was performative, and so that's how I was processing things. I was assuming that everyone was on my level.\n\nAnd what I came to find out is that they really weren't, and that this bitterness towards Obama, [there was] an element of race to it for sure. But more than that, I think that for a lot of the people in the political class, it was this resentment that he got treated so well, that he was the golden child in the media and that everyone loved him and that their candidates didn't get treated as well.\n\nAnd then in the Trump years, this just gets on steroids. What I thought was performative fighting between the parties, among many, many, many of my colleagues actually became a driving, motivating force.\n\nOne guy said to me directly, \"Tim, I'm a white guy, and with all of this woke nonsense and with my wife's friends calling me racist for working for Republicans and all this criticism, all this heat I have to take, I'm not up for jobs. And it just leaves me no choice but to just think about the one or two things I agree with [the Trump administration] on and just focus on that.\"\n\nWhat I came to find out is that that guy really represented the private thoughts of a lot of Republicans.\n\nDK: There's another motivation that I want to drill into. There are two categories of Republicans you call the messiahs and the junior messiahs. And these are people who told themselves and others that they took Trump administration jobs because they were afraid of who would do it otherwise \u2014 that, hey, at least I can be the adult in the room. You do not buy this argument. Why not?\n\nTM: I don't. I think it's the toughest category, because at some level, are we lucky that H.R. McMaster was national security adviser instead of Michael Flynn? Clearly. So it's hard to kind of begrudge H.R. McMaster on the one hand.\n\nOn the other hand, their actions after they took the job \u2014 all of those people who said that they went into the White House because it was better them than someone else \u2014 their actions kind of betrayed that they really had other motivations.\n\nI say that because if it was true that these people went in because they just felt like they had this duty to country and that it was better them in public service than someone else, then they would have supported Joe Biden in 2020. But none of them really came out and said, \"no, we need to stop this person.\" And that would have been the logical next step of somebody that was going in really to save the country.\n\nDK: Throughout your book, it feels like voters are always right at the edge of the picture. I'm thinking about Iowa voters pushing John McCain in 2008 to be tougher on immigration. Or you talk about the formerly moderate New York representative, Elise Stefanik, who justified becoming Trumpier by saying, \"well, I'm just doing what voters want.\" So my question is, you blame a lot of Republican elites for falling in with Trump \u2014 do you feel similarly towards voters?\n\nI don't. I'm of two minds about the voters. One is that I do think they are the ones that are driving this. And my book is about the cowardice of the collaborators. The Republican ruling class would have been happy to go along with a more benevolent person to just continue their access to power, but they went along with the more dangerous and bigoted nativist route, because that's what the voters wanted. And OK, why are voters like that? That's a different book.\n\nI think that the voters have a lot of real reasons why they were upset. I mean, some people are bigots out there for sure. But I think the Republican ruling class didn't listen to [voters'] concerns. I write about the autopsy, which I worked on in 2012. I mean, a lot of Republican voters were mad about the Iraq war, were mad about the hollowing-out of their communities.\n\nWe didn't do anything to try to address that. We didn't challenge Republican orthodoxies on any issues, and Trump did. So I think it makes sense that those voters were attracted to Trump. He was offering them something different.\n\nAnd one of the chapters in the book is [about] the political media class \u2014 the conservative media in particular. It shouldn't be that surprising that if someone is every minute getting a text message or an email or a tweet or a Facebook post about how their country is being stolen from them, that they would want to support radical ends to fix that.\n\nI try to have grace towards voters and people in my life that have gotten swept up in this. And I think that we have, in a representative democracy, an obligation of the people at the top of the funnel to resist people's worst impulses. There was nobody that did that. And that is why those folks are the negative characters in my book.\n\nDK: You mentioned the autopsy you helped write \u2014 the report the RNC released after Mitt Romney lost in 2012, telling the party how to have longer-term success. A lot of it was about working harder to appeal to nonwhite and women voters. Trump certainly did not fit that bill ... and listener Rachel Gershman was wondering in our Facebook group, \"Does the autopsy have any relevance now?\"\n\nTM: Not really. It has relevance as an insight into what the Republican political class, left our own devices, actually wanted. So I think that it's interesting in that regard.\n\nI think there's a lot of reasons to think maybe an autopsy vision of the Republican Party might have worked. Hillary Clinton was a flawed candidate, partially because of that conservative media complex \u2014 the hyperbole and lies that she was targeted with \u2014 but she also had some flaws that she brought upon herself.\n\nCould a candidate that was more moderate on immigration and believed in climate change \u2014 could someone with Elise Stefanik's 2014 platform of believing we should deal with climate change and and supporting gay marriage, could that person have beaten Hillary Clinton? I think maybe, yeah, probably.\n\nBut because Trump won, that created this mindset within the Republican Party, especially after McCain and Romney had lost, that this kind of populist, nativist, working class path is the way for Republicans to win national elections again.\n\nDK: One other thing I wanted to ask about is being a gay Republican. You write about the mental tap dancing you did to support a party that just didn't support gay people like you. I'm wondering if you could tell us how that experience affected how you saw your fellow Republicans do their own sort of tap dancing as they tried to justify their allegiance to Trump.\n\nTM: I spent a lot of time thinking about this because there are obviously limits to any parallel. But I think that there are a lot of parallels.\n\nI look back with regrets on not being more vocal on gay rights matters, on not drawing a bright red line around the types of candidates that I would work for. Part of the reason why I did it when I think back about my own rationalizations was, I felt like the arc of the gay history was bending towards justice, to steal a phrase \u2014 I felt like we were already on this trajectory, and so why should I ruin my career over it?\n\nI also used these same kind of rationalizations of, Oh, the other side's not perfect, too. I mean, in 2008, Obama won't say he's for gay marriage and everybody knows he privately is. You can talk yourself into the fact that, you know, \"the other side is not perfect on this either. And so why should I worry about it?\"\n\nAll of these rationalizations happened, and with the benefit of some distance and with Trump kind of shaking me out of this kind of mindset, I looked back on that and thought, \"Man, I don't think I was seeing myself clearly.\" So when Trump came around, I saw those same machinations happening in my colleagues.\n\nI think the other thing that happened is that whole identity question that I talked about earlier. I was probably the visible gay Republican spokesperson for a while. So I had been through this \u2014 people seeing me in a different way and having to deal with that kind of identity change. And so, I think that it made it less hard for me to do it when Trump came around. I also had those mistakes that I could look back on and say, \"I'm not going to make this mistake again.\"", "label": "human"}
{"text": "As the labor market continues to heat up, employers need to be prepared for an increased risk of employee loss. After all, if job seekers have many options to choose from, they may have the impulse to move on if they are not satisfied with their current job. Not only does this affect the bottom-of-the-line employees of the company's ladder; the most sought after professionals are increasingly likely to jump. Business Insider conducted an exclusive survey of more than 1,000 people in order to reveal the jobs most likely to experience high employee turnover. We asked respondents to list the types of jobs they wanted to leave as soon as possible and used the results to compile a ranking of the jobs most likely to occur. Here are 20 jobs that people are most likely to leave soon, from the smallest to the most likely: 1. Accounting 2. Chef/Chef 3. Human resources 4. Retail shopkeepers 5. Truck drivers 6. Sales assistant 7. Administrative Assistant 8. Marketing specialists 9. Network developers 10. Lawyers 11. Teachers 12. Project Manager 13. Account manager 14. Customer service representatives 15.Graphic Designers 16. Database administrators 17. Software development 18. Registered nurses 19. Financial Analysts 20. Information technology manager Our survey shows that the most popular job accountants on the list are the least likely to experience a loss of employees. Of the 1,000 respondents, only 2% said they plan to leave accounting in the near future. Chefs/Chefs and HR were the least likely to change positions, with only 3% and 4% of respondents saying they planned to leave respectively. On the other hand, IT managers are jobs where people are most likely to quit soon. Of the 1,000 respondents, 11% said they plan to leave their IT positions. Surprisingly, the most demanding jobs on the list - software developers - also top the list. 10% of respondents said they expected to leave their software developer roles soon. Given the rapid development of the technology and software industries, these numbers are not surprising. As more employers demand cutting-edge skills, professionals may be motivated to turn to organizations that provide a more advanced environment. Financial analysts and registered nurses were the second and third most likely to change positions, with 8% and 7% of respondents saying they plan to leave, respectively. It's clear that employees are starting to feel a greater sense of job security, which could lead to an increase in employee turnover in the coming months. Employers should be proactive about engaging employees, providing adequate growth opportunities and offering competitive compensation programs. If employees are satisfied with their job and get support from the organization, they're more likely to stay with the same employer for years to come.", "label": "machine"}

Not only does the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae offer lots of great travel perks, but the Priority Pass Select membership doesn't exclude access to restaurants and cafes like membership through American Express and other cards do.\n\nThe card currently offers a welcome bonus of 60,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening (worth $1,080 in travel, based on Insider's valuation of Chase points). The annual fee is $550, but cardholders receive up to $300 in travel credits each year and top-notch travel and purchase protections.\n\nChase Sapphire Reserve Priority Pass details The primary cardholder and up to two guests get unlimited free visits\n\nAirport restaurants are included (most offer credit for cardholder and one guest)\n\nAuthorized users ($75 each per year) get their own Priority Pass Select membership with guest privileges\n\nFor just $75 annually, you can add an authorized user to your Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae, and this qualifies for the same membership perks. That includes bringing up to two guests into the lounge per visit. Any guests beyond this number can enter at a discounted rate of $32 per person.\n\nThe Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card is Capital One's first-ever premium credit card, and it's a great value if you want a Priority Pass Select membership with unlimited visits and unlimited guests (although if a lounge is busy, you might be limited in the number of guests you can bring).\n\nEffective January 1, 2023, Priority Pass membership from the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card no longer includes access to restaurants, spas, or non-lounge experiences, similar to American Express cards.\n\nIts annual fee of Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card is lower than similar travel rewards cards, and you'll also get access to Plaza Premium Lounges and Capital One's new airport lounges, the first of which recently opened at Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW), with two more opening this year in Denver (DEN) and Washington-Dulles (IAD).\n\nThe Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card is also an affordable choice if you want your authorized users to receive Priority Pass access as well. You can add up to four authorized users for free, and each gets their own Priority Pass Select membership and Plaza Premium/Capital One airport lounge access.\n\nCapital One Venture X Priority Pass details The primary cardholder and an unlimited number of guests get unlimited free visits\n\nAirport restaurants are not included effective January 1, 2023\n\nUp to four free authorized users get their own Priority Pass Select membership with guest privileges\n\nThe Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card offers a welcome bonus of 75,000 bonus miles when you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening (worth $1,275 according to our valuation of Capital One miles). In addition, cardholders receive up to $300 in credit toward Capital One travel portal purchases each year.\n\nThe Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express offers one of the most comprehensive airport lounge programs of any premium credit card, which includes access to the Priority Pass network as well as Centurion lounges, Delta Sky Clubs (when you fly Delta), and several other lounge brands.\n\nPrimary cardholders and authorized users get Priority Pass Select membership** with complimentary admission for up to two guests per visit (additional guests cost $32). You won't get access to Priority Pass airport restaurants because this is an American Express card, so if that's important to you, another different card may be a better fit.\n\nAmex Platinum Priority Pass details The primary cardholder and up to two guests get unlimited free visits\n\nAirport restaurants are not included\n\nYou can add up to three authorized users for $175 total per year and each gets their own Priority Pass membership with guest privileges\n\nThe Platinum Card currently offers a welcome bonus of 80,000 Membership Rewards\u00ae points after spending $6,000 on purchases in the first six months of card membership (worth $1,440 according to Insider's Amex points valuation). It also offers a slew of benefits to help offset its $695 annual fee.\n\nSmall-business owners who travel frequently might prefer The Business Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express , which comes with the same Priority Pass and other lounge access as the personal version of the card. Authorized users cost $300 each and receive their own Priority Pass membership with guest privileges.\n\nAmex Business Platinum Priority Pass details The primary cardholder and up to two guests get unlimited free visits\n\nAirport restaurants are not included\n\nAuthorized users cost $300 per year and receive their own Priority Pass membership with guest privileges\n\nThe Amex Business Platinum Card is offering a welcome bonus of 120,000 Membership Rewards\u00ae points after spending $15,000 on eligible purchases with your card within the first 3 months of card membership (worth $2,160 based on Insider's valuations). You can offset its $695 annual fee with valuable statement credits for airline incidental fees**, Dell Technologies, Indeed, Adobe, and U.S. wireless service providers**, and more.\n\nThe Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant\u00ae American Express\u00ae Card is Marriott's premium credit card, and along with upscale hotel perks and statement credits, it also offers a Priority Pass Select membership for the primary cardholder.\n\nAgain, because it's an Amex card, there's no access to Priority Pass airport restaurants, and in this case, authorized users don't get their own membership.\n\nMarriott Bonvoy Brilliant Priority Pass details The primary cardholder and up to two guests get unlimited free visits\n\nAirport restaurants are not included\n\nAuthorized users do not receive Priority Pass benefits\n\nThe Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant\u00ae American Express\u00ae Card currently offers a hefty welcome bonus: 150,000 Marriott Bonvoy\u00ae bonus points after spending $5,000 in purchases on the card within the first three months from account opening (worth $1,050 in travel, according to Insider's Marriott points valuation).\n\nThere's a $650 annual fee, but in return, cardholders get up to $300 in statement credits per calendar year (up to $25 per month) for eligible purchases at restaurants worldwide, Platinum elite status, and a free night each year after your card renewal month at hotels where the redemption level is at or under 85,000 Marriott Bonvoy points.\n\nThe Hilton Honors American Express Aspire Card is one of the best hotel credit cards because of the generous benefits it offers. Along with complimentary top-tier Hilton Diamond elite status, cardholders receive up to $250 in Hilton resort credits each anniversary year, up to $250 in airline incidental fee credits** each calendar year, and an annual free night valid at nearly any Hilton hotel.\n\nCardholders receive a Priority Pass Select membership and guest privileges (up to two per visit), but again, because it's an Amex card, restaurants are excluded. Authorized users do not get their own Priority Pass membership, either.\n\nAmex Hilton Aspire Priority Pass details The primary cardholder and up to two guests get unlimited free visits\n\nAirport restaurants are not included\n\nAuthorized users do not receive Priority Pass benefits\n\nThe Hilton Honors American Express Aspire Card is currently offering a welcome bonus of 150,000 points after spending at least $4,000 in the first three months of account opening (worth $750 in stays, according to Insider's valuations). There's a $450 annual fee.\n\nThe U.S. Bank Altitude\u00ae Reserve Visa Infinite\u00ae Card is a premium card that comes with a limited Priority Pass Select membership. The membership is valid for 12 months and comes with four free visits for the primary cardholder and four guest visits. Additional visits are $32 each, and authorized users aren't eligible for their own membership.\n\nThe card also comes with excellent Visa Infinite benefits including top-notch travel and purchase protections. Cardholders receive up to $325 per year in credit toward travel and dining purchases, which offsets most of the card's $400 annual fee.\n\nUS Bank Altitude Reserve Priority Pass details The primary cardholder receives a 12-month Priority Pass Select membership\n\nFour visits for the primary cardholder and four guest visits are free (including restaurants); after that, a $32 fee per visit applies\n\nAuthorized users do not get their own Priority Pass membership\n\nThere's also a solid welcome bonus on the U.S. Bank Altitude\u00ae Reserve Visa Infinite\u00ae Card: 50,000 points after you spend $4,500 on purchases in the first 90 days of account opening.\n\nIf you don't want to shell out hundreds of dollars for an annual fee but still want Priority Pass lounge access, the Hilton Honors American Express Surpass\u00ae Card is an excellent option. It has a $95 annual fee, but it comes with a Priority Pass Select membership that includes 10 free visits a year.\n\nThis is a good choice for less-frequent travelers who might not need unlimited lounge visits or care about restaurant credits. Keep in mind that authorized users won't receive a Priority Pass membership, either.\n\nAmex Hilton Surpass Priority Pass details The primary cardholder receives a Priority Pass Select membership (no restaurant access)\n\nCardholders receive 10 free visits total (for themselves and guests) each year; after that, visits are $32 each\n\nAuthorized users do not receive Priority Pass benefits\n\nIf you open the Hilton Honors American Express Surpass\u00ae Card now, you can earn an excellent welcome bonus of 130,000 points after spending $2,000 in eligible purchases on the card in the first 3 months of card membership (worth $650 in stays based on our valuations).\n\nCardholders also receive automatic Hilton Gold elite status which offers perks like better rooms and free breakfast (currently awarded as a food and beverage credit in the US).\n\nLike the Hilton Honors American Express Surpass\u00ae Card, The Hilton Honors American Express Business Card is a solid choice if you don't travel often but still want Priority Pass airport lounge access. Again, restaurants are excluded, but this card's membership includes 10 free visits per year.\n\nFor a reasonable $95 annual fee, cardholders also receive Hilton Gold elite status and great bonus earning categories. Authorized users do not receive their own Priority Pass membership.\n\nAmex Hilton Business Priority Pass details The primary cardholder receives a Priority Pass Select membership (no restaurant access)\n\nCardholders receive 10 free visits total (for themselves and guests) each year; after that, visits are $32 each\n\nAuthorized users do not receive Priority Pass benefits\n\nThe Hilton Honors American Express Business Card is offering a welcome bonus right now: 130,000 bonus points after spending $3,000 in purchases on the card in the first three months of card membership (worth $650 in stays based on our valuations). You can find out more in our Hilton Honors Business card review.\n\nOther credit cards with Priority Pass lounge access\n\nThere are a couple of other credit cards that come with Priority Pass Select membership, but neither is currently available to new applicants:\n\nCiti Prestige\u00ae Card : Unlimited visits for the primary cardholder and up to two guests or immediate family (defined as spouse/domestic partner and children under 18). Authorized users cost $75 and get their own Priority Pass Select membership with the same guest privileges. The annual fee is $495 for the primary cardmember.\n\n: Unlimited visits for the primary cardholder and up to two guests or immediate family (defined as spouse/domestic partner and children under 18). Authorized users cost $75 and get their own Priority Pass Select membership with the same guest privileges. The annual fee is $495 for the primary cardmember. Ritz-Carlton Rewards\u00ae Credit Card: Unlimited visits for the primary cardholder and no limit on the number of guests. Authorized users are free and receive the same unlimited guest privileges. $450 annual fee.\n\nThe Ritz-Carlton Rewards\u00ae Credit Card is still available as an upgrade from the Marriott Bonvoy Boundless\u00ae Credit Card or Marriott Bonvoy Bold\u00ae Credit Card. If you've had one of these cards for at least a year, it's possible to call Chase and request to change to the Ritz-Carlton Rewards\u00ae Credit Card. You won't earn a welcome bonus, but it could be worth it if the card's benefits are valuable to you.\n\nWhat is Priority Pass?\n\nPriority Pass is a network of more than 1,300 airport lounges, restaurants, and caf\u00e9s worldwide. Many of these are independent lounges that aren't affiliated with a particular airline, but sometimes you'll find branded lounges \u2014 like the Air France/KLM lounge or Star Alliance lounge \u2014 at certain airports.\n\nMany larger US airports have Priority Pass lounges and restaurants, but there are even more overseas, so having a Priority Pass membership is especially useful if you travel internationally.\n\nYou can find Priority Pass lounges and restaurants by searching for your airport on the Priority Pass website or through the Priority Pass app. Here you'll be able to check lounge hours, amenities, guest policies, and any restrictions to be aware of.\n\nPriority Pass lounges\n\nTypically, airport lounges in the Priority Pass network are off-limits to the general public unless you have access through a membership, airline ticket, elite status, or via a paid day pass. They offer a quieter, more comfortable place to relax before a flight, usually offering light food and drinks, free Wi-Fi, and sometimes showers or other amenities depending on the location.\n\nInternational lounges are often nicer with better amenities and food than you'll find in US airports, too. Keep in mind that Priority Pass can deny access to its lounges if they are overcrowded \u2014 if it's busy, you may have to wait to get in.\n\nPriority Pass restaurants, caf\u00e9s, spas, and more\n\nIn addition to airport lounges, the Priority Pass network includes restaurants and caf\u00e9s at airports like Houston (IAH) and San Francisco (SFO). Priority Pass members can get anywhere from $28 to $30 of free food and drinks at participating restaurants.\n\nThe credit is usually enough for an entr\u00e9e or snack and adult beverage \u2014 and this can be a great way to save money if you'd otherwise buy a pricey meal at the airport. Some airports have multiple participating restaurants, and there's no reason you can't use the credit at each one, even on the same trip.\n\nSome airports also have other non-lounge experiences (like spas or rest suites) that are included in the Priority Pass network. In these cases, check the Priority Pass website or app to find out what's included in your complimentary visit.\n\nKeep in mind American Express cardholders no longer get access to Priority Pass airport restaurants or most other non-lounge locations (like Be Relax airport spas). And the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card lost access to Priority Pass restaurants/spas/non-lounge experiences on January 1, 2023.\n\nBe sure to check each restaurant's guest policy \u2014 often the credit is for the primary member and one guest (as opposed to two free guests at most lounges).\n\nPriority Pass membership options\n\nIf you want to buy a Priority Pass membership, there are three options:\n\nStandard membership: $99 per year and enables you to buy lounge passes for $32 per visit\n\nStandard Plus: $299 per year and gets you 10 free visits\n\nPrestige membership: $429 per year and includes unlimited free visits to Priority Pass lounges\n\nAll of these membership tiers allow you to purchase guest passes for $32 per person.\n\nThe Priority Pass membership you get from a credit card is called Priority Pass Select, which you can't purchase directly. It's much better than the publicly available memberships in that most credit cards offer some form of free guest access.\n\nCredit cards with Priority Pass frequently asked questions (FAQ)\n\nIs Priority Pass membership automatic when you open an eligible credit card? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. In most cases, Priority Pass membership does not happen automatically when you're approved for an eligible credit card \u2014 you'll typically have to activate it by enrolling through your card's online account or by calling the number on the back of your card. For example, with American Express cards like the Platinum Card, you'll find an enrollment link under the \"Benefits\" tab in your account online. Each authorized user needs to enroll separately for their own Priority Pass membership as well.\n\nCan you access airport lounges with just your credit card? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. To enter a Priority Pass lounge or receive a food and beverage credit at participating airport restaurants, you'll need to show your Priority Pass Select membership card. Most (not all) lounges will also accept a digital card through the Priority Pass app, but it's best to carry your physical card with you just in case. Your credit card alone will not get you into Priority Pass lounges.\n\nWhat if you have a large family or are traveling in a big group? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. With most cards, you're limited to two free guests \u2014 but if you have more people traveling with you, it may be possible to pay an entrance fee (usually $27 to $32) for your additional companions. Keep in mind there may be restrictions due to space availability so this may not always be an option. One workaround for those with large families is to add a family member as an authorized user to cards like the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae or Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card. That authorized user would get their own membership with two guests allowed \u2014 but keep in mind you must be at least 18 to enroll in Priority Pass.\n\nDo children count as Priority Pass lounge guests? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Most lounges will allow children to enter as long as they're accompanied by a responsible adult, but keep in mind they'll usually be counted as a guest and be subject to an entrance fee if you're over your complimentary guest limit. In some cases, lounges will allow children under a certain age to enter for free (without being counted toward your guest limit), but this is the exception rather than the rule.\n\nIf you cancel your credit card, can you still access Priority Pass lounges? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. When you cancel your credit card, you won't be able to access Priority Pass lounges, even if the expiration date on your membership card is well into the future. The bank notifies Priority Pass about the cancellation and your membership will terminate effective the same day you cancel your credit card.\n\nCan you 'stack' two Priority Pass memberships to get more guests into a lounge? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. If you have more than one Priority Pass membership from different credit cards, it might be tempting to try to use both cards to allow yourself more free guests in a single visit. Unfortunately, you can only use one membership card per visit per person, so it's not possible to stack these benefits. However, it is possible to visit more than one lounge or restaurant in the same airport on the same day.\n\nJasmin Baron, CEPF Editor Jasmin Baron is an editor at Insider, responsible for credit card coverage on Personal Finance Insider.

{"text": "The desire to smell good is nothing new. Based on what archeologists have discovered in ancient tombs, Egyptians and Mesopotamians were making perfume with ingredients such as jasmine, resin and myrrh way back in 3,000 B.C. Today, women\u2019s fragrance is a $679 million industry in the U.S. and Black people account for a whopping $151 million of that spending, according to a 2018 Nielsen Report.\n\nOur demand for perfume is strong, but those who want to go from consumer to creator face a challenging path due to a lack of access to education (traditional perfumers typically study in France), capital and mentorship. Although nearly 74 percent of all perfumers are white, a whiff of change is in the air.\n\nAnd it\u2019s about time. For decades, perfume ads and commercials have served as a reflection of everything most humans want: love, sex, power and validation. Consider the coolness projected by Calvin Klein\u2019s CK One campaigns, the sophistication of Chanel No. 5 images and the sex appeal exuded by Dior J\u2019adore ads. As consumers, we know we\u2019re buying into a fantasy, but the power of perfume is undeniable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith just a spritz or two, fragrance can make you feel confident, desirable and worthy of taking up space. It can unlock memories and create new ones. That\u2019s why a growing group of perfumers from the diaspora is disrupting the landscape with indie brands, letting the industry know that people of color belong there too. These pioneers aren\u2019t just grabbing a piece of the pie \u2014 they\u2019re also forging strong connections with underappreciated customers and championing the need for change.\n\n\u201cDiversity is happening in the niche fragrance business, but it would be great to see more people of color in perfumer roles at the bigger houses,\u201d said Maya Njie, founder of an eponymous line of perfumes. \u201cWith new generations coming in, this will happen more and more. The industry should offer scholarships and training that encourage diversity and show that it is a field where anybody can flourish if they put their mind to it.\u201d\n\nFind out what inspired her and her fellow entrepreneurs:\n\nDawn Marie West, founder and creative director of La Botic\u00e1\n\nDawn Marie West launched La Botic\u00e1 in 2018. Photos courtesy of La Botic\u00e1\n\nQueens, New York-based perfumer Dawn Marie West learned the power of scent at a young age. \u201cMy grandmother was a laundress, and she would wash laundry for clients at home when I was a child,\u201d she said. \u201cThe sheets hanging in our backyard filled the entire house with the smell of fabric softener. The aroma takes me back to my youth and reminds me of my grandmother\u2019s work ethic and the entrepreneurial spirit that she passed down to me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWest is inspired by different times in her life. Photos courtesy of La Botica\n\nBlending fragrances for La Botic\u00e1, the luxury fragrance collection West launched in 2018, also transports her to various times in her life. \u201cI find inspiration in places that represent my culture and what feels familiar,\u201d West said. For example, her scent Nolita 96 was inspired by years working at downtown art galleries (she\u2019s a photographer as well) and captures the vibe of concrete and effortless style. Another standout, Flor de Selva, features indigenous oils found in the Dominican Republic, a nod to West\u2019s Afro-Dominican heritage.\n\nMaya Njie, founder of Maya Njie Perfumes\n\nMaya Njie began to work with fragrances in 2012. Photo credit: Jacob Lillis.\n\nIn 2012, an old photo album inspired London-based perfumer Maya Njie to experiment with fragrance. She began bottling scents tied to her family history and by 2016, she turned what began as a personal project into a lauded line of fragrances. Njie channels her Swedish and Gambian heritage into all aspects of her line, from the minimalist packaging \u2015 which she calls \u201cScandinavian at heart\u201d \u2015 to the fragrance notes.\n\n\u201cTobak is connected to the smell of tobacco leaves, leather, smoke, tonka and wood. Even though it draws an immediate line back to my grandfather in Sweden, the smell is also reminiscent of craft markets in Gambia,\u201d she said. Njie advises aspiring Black perfumers to stay true to themselves while trying to break into the fragrance world. \u201cThere is a place for you here,\u201d she said. \u201cConsumers are keen to support people they can relate to so, keep walking on that path. It\u2019s long and requires persistence but there are plenty of nice people along the way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris Collins, founder of Chris Collins Fragrances\n\n\u201cThe road of a Black perfumer isn\u2019t easy, but the journey is worth it when you see your fragrances touch people,\u201d Chris Collins said. Although he\u2019s been \u201cobsessed\u201d with fragrance since he was a child, he didn\u2019t create his eponymous line until 2018 after spending 20 years as a Ralph Lauren model. \u201cMy father wore classic 1970s colognes like English Leather and Grey Flannel,\u201d Collins said. \u201cI always knew when he was home from work because I could smell him first. That\u2019s when I first fell in love with fragrance.\u201d\n\nChris Collins spent 20 years as a Ralph Lauren model before creating his fragrance line. Photo Courtesy of Chris Collins\n\nHis first trio of perfumes celebrated his historic neighborhood. \u201cI\u2019ve called Harlem home for 18 years,\u201d he said. \u201cI was inspired by the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s, a time when Black culture, music, literature and art flourished. I wanted to tell that story through fragrances.\u201d\n\nFour years later, it\u2019s clear that the industry likes the tales he\u2019s spinning: Collins\u2019 line is now sold at Sephora, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman, Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus.\n\nKimberly Walker, founder of Kimberly Walker New York\n\nKimberly Walker debuted her fragrance Artsy in 2016. Photo Courtesy of KIMBERLY New York\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore launching her namesake line, Kimberly Walker witnessed the lack of diversity in the perfume business up close. \u201cDuring my 10-year career as a department store luxury fragrance sales manager, I never encountered a brand led by a Black, female perfumer,\u201d she said. That motivated her to fill the void. Walker taught herself enough about chemistry and fragrance composition to create Artsy, a sweet and romantic scent that debuted in 2016 (after plenty of trial and error).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still my everyday fragrance and top seller,\u201d Walker said. When blending and naming some of her other fragrances, Jamaican-born Walker drew upon her West Indian heritage. One example: \u201cMy fragrance diaspora is a celebration of people of [African descent] and features Jamaican rose apple paired with notes of sparkling champagne.\u201d\n\nChavalia Dunlap-Mwamba, founder of Pink MahogHany Fragrances\n\nChavalia Dunlap-Mwamba recently launched a new set of gender-neutral scents. Photo Courtesy of Pink Mahogany\n\n\u201cDuring my tenure as an educator, I found out that many people had adverse reactions to fragrance,\u201d said Chavalia Dunlap-Mwamba, the self-taught perfumer behind Pink MahogHany. \u201cMy research confirmed that phthalates [chemicals commonly used to make scents last] were often the culprit. As a fragrance aficionado, I wanted to create a collection without them.\u201d\n\nBased in Longview, Texas, Dunlap-Mwamba has been making scents for 17 years. She said that inspiration comes to her \u201cin every form imaginable,\u201d especially when she\u2019s spending time alone outside. \u201cI always keep a notepad or my phone handy to jot down quick ideas,\u201d she said. This fall, she launched a new set of sweet and earthy gender-neutral scents called The Y\u00d6U Collection, designed to encourage wearers to tap into their sensual side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShawn Crenshaw, founder and CEO of Ovation\n\nShawn Crenshaw introduced the fragrance Ovation for Men in 2017. Credit: Rafael Gutierrez\n\nAtlanta-based entrepreneur Shawn Crenshaw spent 18 years in the hospitality industry before a frustrating experience at a department store motivated him to pivot into the perfume biz. While he was shopping for Christmas gifts for his male relatives, he noticed something.\n\n\u201cNot one brand had a face or a representation of anyone that looked like me,\u201d Crenshaw said. \u201cIt hit me like a ton of bricks that we as consumers held these designer brands in such high regard, but none of them \u2015 based on their marketing \u2015 held us equally in such high regard. That\u2019s when I realized there was an opportunity to create a brand that elevated the image of African American men.\u201d\n\nOvation for Men was the result of years of learning about the industry.

{"text": "As 2023 rapidly approaches, there is much speculation about the future of the world economy. The price of goods and services will undoubtedly rise or fall in the coming year, but some products may become more affordable. 1. Energy Solar and wind power are becoming more cost-effective and reliable, and research is underway to make these energy sources cheaper. The cost of electricity such as natural gas, coal, and oil may fall, while the price of renewables will also decline. 2. Transport Companies like Alphabet's self-driving car division Waymo are developing autonomous vehicles that can safely and efficiently transport people. These vehicles have the potential to make transportation cheaper, because they will be able to avoid traffic and operate more efficiently than human-driven cars. 3. Foodstuffs With advances in agricultural technology and genetic engineering, food production may become cheaper. Crops can be better protected against droughts, pests, and disease, allowing farmers to grow more with fewer resources. 4. Communications The cost of communication services is also likely to decline in 2023, thanks to the development of 5G technology that will allow people to access faster Internet speeds, improve video conferencing and better connectivity. Moreover, the emergence of cloud computing will enable companies to store data and run applications more efficiently, thereby reducing process costs. 5. Education Online learning platforms are becoming more popular and efficient, allowing people to learn at their own pace and time. Moreover, free educational content is available on platforms such as YouTube and Khan Academy, so that anyone can get a high-quality education without breaking the bank's restrictions. 6. Health care Companies are developing innovative technologies such as telemedicine and wearable devices that can monitor health and detect disease early on. These technologies could help reduce long-term healthcare costs by giving people faster and more efficient access to care. The future of the world economy is unpredictable, but certain goods and services are likely to become cheaper in the coming year. As technology advances, energy, transportation, food, communications, education, and health care can all become more affordable, allowing people to save money in the long run.", "label": "machine"}

Vertical mergers, which see companies operating at different levels of production in an industry combine, are trickier to build an antitrust case against than horizontal ones that see direct rivals combine \u2014 such as Facebook's (successful) 2012 acquisition of Instagram.\n\nThe Microsoft-Activision deal is seen as a vertical merger, one in which the tech giant would be adding an additional video game developer to its existing roster of in-house developers, rather than creating a developer conglomerate that sees others combine under its watch.\n\nThe most notable, recent success the FTC has had with tackling vertical mergers came in December 2021, when it sued to block the $40 billion acquisition of SoftBank-owned chip designer Arm by industry heavyweight Nvidia.\n\nThe move triggered a series of events that eventually saw the deal collapse in February 2022, with Arm seeking to return to public markets as a plan B.\n\nAt the time, the FTC said \"the termination of what would have been the largest semiconductor chip merger will preserve competition for key technologies and safeguard future innovation.\"\n\nBut the US government has previously struggled to see similar high-profile cases through, with the Department of Justice losing its case to undo AT&T's $80 billion purchase of Time Warner in February 2019, following a ruling from US District Court judge Richard Leon.\n\nMicrosoft has argued that the FTC's probe is \"unconstitutional\" and marks an overreach in its exercising of power.\n\nSkilled negotiator\n\nMicrosoft has also become a skilled negotiator, learning from the bruising it took from antitrust regulators in the 1990s.\n\nIn 1998, the US government accused Microsoft of abusing Windows' popularity to ensure the dominance of Internet Explorer at the expense of rivals such as Netscape.\n\nIt was a blockbuster case that saw Bill Gates appear on Capitol Hill to testify against claims that it violated the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. The court ultimately ruled that Microsoft had been in violation of the act.\n\nThough Microsoft successfully appealed against being broken up, it did agree on settlements that would restrict some of its practices at the time, such as forcing PC makers to work with them exclusively.\n\nSince that saga, Microsoft has worked to avoid the watchful eye of regulators and found ways of negotiating to get what it wants.\n\nTake its $7.5 billion deal to buy game developer Bethesda in September 2020, which had the potential to spark antitrust concerns; the acquisition was finalized six months later after some concessions were made with worried EU regulators.\n\nIt is likely that Microsoft will play a similar game with its Activision purchase. In November, it emerged that Microsoft was considering offering a 10-year licensing deal to PlayStation creator Sony that would make Activision games available to rivals that aren't Xbox, according to Reuters.\n\nThat said, Microsoft's acquisition of Activision will prove even tougher to tackle than anything Amazon has thrown up for the FTC chief to date. Its success will depend on its ability to make a case against one of Silicon Valley's most experienced players, as well as a deal type that has historically stood up to scrutiny.\n\nFailure will likely embolden Big Tech to test the waters further.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "London CNN \u2014\n\nEuropean stocks are pushing higher for the third straight day as investors cheer signs that inflation, supply chain bottlenecks and natural gas prices are all easing\n\nEurope\u2019s Stoxx 600 (SXXL) index rose 1% in Wednesday trading, and is now up 3.3% since markets kicked off 2023 trading on Monday. Germany\u2019s DAX (DAX) rose 1.8% on Wednesday, while France\u2019s CAC (CAC40) gained 1.9%. London\u2019s FTSE 100 index also gained 0.4%.\n\nDespite the undeniably gloomy outlook for the global economy \u2014 the International Monetary Fund expects one third of economies to fall into a recession this year \u2014 investors in European stocks are feeling cautiously optimistic following the release of a string of better-than-expected data indicating that the slowdown might not be as deep as once feared.\n\nOn Wednesday, France\u2019s statistics institute said consumer price inflation was 5.9% in December, down from 6.2% in November. A drop in energy prices drove the decline, the institute said.\n\nIn Germany, Europe\u2019s biggest economy, provisional data released on Tuesday showed that inflation had fallen to 8.6% in December, from 10% the month before. A one-off government payment to households to subsidize energy bills helped bring prices down.\n\nWeaker inflation is raising hopes among investors that the European Central Bank may be able to hike interest rates less aggressively this year, after increasing the cost of borrowing four times in a row since July 2022.\n\nAnd business activity across the 20 countries sharing the euro currency, while historically still low, ticked up in December from the month prior, according to a survey of companies released by S&P Global on Wednesday.\n\nThat adds to promising survey data released on Monday, also from S&P Global, showing that supply chain pressures and inflation for the region\u2019s manufacturers appear to be easing up.\n\nChris Beauchamp, chief market analyst for IG, an online trading platform, told CNN that the boost for markets is partly due to the slowdown in inflation.\n\n\u201cIt seems that investors are being tempted back now that the [Russia-Ukraine] war has been contained, and the worst of the sanctions discussions appear over for the time being,\u201d he added.\n\nTraders aren\u2019t so cheery across the pond. The S&P 500 (DVS) was down 0.4% at the close of trading Tuesday and the Dow (A1BSC) ended little changed, despite rallying in the morning. US futures were up slightly on Wednesday morning, but still trailing markets in Europe.\n\nWall Street\u2019s relatively sluggish start to the new year may be due to the higher number of poor-performing tech stocks in the United States, according to Beauchamp. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (COMP) is down 34% from this time last year.\n\n\u201cIf we are seeing a continued flight to value, then the relative cheapness of European stocks is a big plus,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lack of expensive tech names has been a real boost for the FTSE 100, but other indices in Europe are picking up too.\u201d\n\nAn easing energy crisis\n\nHigh levels of natural gas storage and unseasonably mild weather have put Europe in a stronger position than many feared a few months ago.\n\nBenchmark prices for European natural gas futures have tumbled 10% since Monday to \u20ac69 ($73) per megawatt hour. They\u2019re now down 79% since their all-time high in August, when they traded at \u20ac342 ($363) per megawatt hour.\n\nEuropean countries raced to fill their gas stores last year as Russia, once their biggest supplier, slashed its exports. Stores are currently filled to 84% of capacity \u2014 compared with 52% at the same time last year.\n\nAs such, Europe will likely avoid a much-feared energy shortage this winter, though it still faces the task of refilling its storage before next winter\u2019s heating season with little gas now flowing from Russia.\n\nRecord-breaking temperatures have helped keep storage levels high. On January 1, at least eight European countries recorded their warmest January day ever, climatologist Maximiliano Herrera told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nFears about energy supplies that led to significant outflows from European equities last year now seem \u201cunjustified as the risk of a severe energy shortage has diminished,\u201d Deutsche Bank analysts Maximilian Uleer and Carolin Raab wrote in a note on Wednesday.\n\n\u2014 Christian Edwards contributed reporting.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN \u2014\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un is calling for an \u201cexponential increase\u201d in his country\u2019s nuclear weapons arsenal in response to what he claims are threats from South Korea and the United States, Pyongyang\u2019s state media reported Sunday.\n\nKim\u2019s comments come as North Korea twice over the weekend tested what it claimed was a large, nuclear-capable, multiple-launch rocket system that could put all of South Korea in its range, according to a report from the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).\n\nSpeaking on New Year\u2019s Eve on the final day of a six-day plenary session that reviewed 2022, Kim said South Korea has become an \u201cundoubted enemy\u201d and its main ally, the US, has increased pressure on the North to the \u201cmaximum\u201d level over the past year by frequently deploying its military assets to the Korean Peninsula.\n\nNorth Korea's leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday praised the country's \"super-large\" Multiple Rocket Launcher (MRL), which he claims will put all of South Korea within range and can be loaded with tactical nuclear warheads. KCNA\n\nIn response, Kim said in the coming year that Pyonyang must mass produce tactical nuclear weapons while developing a new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that would give the North a \u201cquick counterstrike capability,\u201d according to the KCNA report.\n\nKim\u2019s comments come at the end of a year that saw his regime test more missiles than at any time in North Korean history, including an ICBM that could in theory strike the US mainland.\n\nOn Saturday, in its 37th day of missile tests in 2022, North Korea fired at least three short-range ballistic missiles from a site south of Pyongyang, according to South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nIt followed that early Sunday with another test. North Korea said both Saturday\u2019s and Sunday\u2019s tests were of a 600mm multiple-launch rocket (MRL) system. Most multiple-rocket launch systems in service around the world are around 300mm in size.\n\nThe 600mm MRL was first introduced three years ago, and production has been increased since late October of 2022 for deployment, Kim said in his speech to the plenary session on Saturday, according to KCNA. He later added that an additional 30 of the 600mm MRL will be deployed to the military simultaneously.\n\nKim said the weapon is capable of overcoming high landforms, can consecutively strike with precision, has all of South Korea in its shooting range and can be loaded with tactical nuclear warheads, according to the KCNA report.\n\n\u201cProspectively, as a key offensive weapon of our military forces, it will carry out its own combat mission to overwhelm the enemy,\u201d Kim said.\n\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, pictured on November 2, 2022, said his country should respond with clear retaliation to North Korea's provocations. Yonhap/Reuters\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry later responded to Kim\u2019s comments, calling them \u201cprovocative language that seriously harms peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula.\u201d\n\nThe ministry urged Pyongyang to \u201cimmediately stop\u201d developing nuclear weapons and return to the path of denuclearization, warning that the \u201cKim Jong Un regime will come to an end if North Korea attempts to use nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\nThe ministry vowed to maintain its military readiness posture to \u201cfirmly respond\u201d to any North Korean threats, adding that the military will strengthen its \u201cthree-axis\u201d defense system designed to counter North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile threats.\n\nThe three-axis defense system consists of the Kill Chain preemptive strike system, the Korea Air and Missile Defense system and the Korea Massive Punishment and Retaliation plan, an operational plan to incapacitate the North Korean leadership in a major conflict.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s President Yoon Suk Yeol said on Sunday during a phone call with military chiefs that North Korea will continue to conduct constant nuclear and missile provocations, and South Korea\u2019s military should respond with clear retaliation, his office said.\n\nExpert: North Korea expanding capabilities\n\nLeif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said Pyongyang has used the past year to demonstrate its ability to perform a range of military strikes.\n\n\u201cIts recent missile launches were not technically impressive. Instead, the high volume of tests at unusual times and from various locations demonstrate that North Korea could launch different types of attack, anytime, and from many directions,\u201d Easley said.\n\nEasley also noted that it\u2019s not just missiles that North Korea is using to up the military pressure on the South. Last week, Pyongyang flew five drones into South Korean airspace, forcing Seoul to scramble fighter jets and helicopters to track them and later to send its own drones into North Korean airspace.\n\nIt all leads to an escalation of tensions, according to Easley.\n\n\u201cSuch provocations, including drone incursions, appear excessive for deterrence and may be intended to scare South Korea into taking a softer policy. But with Kim disavowing diplomacy and threatening to mass produce nuclear weapons, the Yoon administration is likely to further increase South Korea\u2019s defense capabilities and readiness,\u201d Easley said.\n\nFor its part, South Korea is beefing up forces, too.\n\nSeoul\u2019s Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) announced last month it will spend more than $2.7 billion over 10 years to strengthen the mission capabilities and survivability of its fleet of F-15K fighters, jets that would play a key role in any possible strikes on North Korea.\n\nWashington is also not standing still. As well as deploying assets like F-22 fighters and B-1 bombers to the exercises around the Korean Peninsula, the US military recently activated its first Space Force command on foreign soil in South Korea, with the unit\u2019s new commander saying he is ready to face any threat in the region.\n\nThe new unit \u201cwill be tasked with coordinating space operations and services such as missile warning, position navigation and timing and satellite communications within the region,\u201d according to US Forces Korea.\n\nEven before Kim\u2019s latest remarks, experts had noted the big strides Pyongyang had made in its missile forces over the past year.\n\nAnkit Panda, a nuclear policy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told CNN in mid-December that Pyongyang has emerged as a missile power.\n\n\u201cThe bigger picture is that North Korea is literally turning into a prominent operator of large-scale missile forces,\u201d Panda said. \u201cThe word test is no longer appropriate to talk about most North Korean missile launches.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost of the missiles they\u2019ve launched this year are parts of military exercises. They are rehearsing for nuclear war. And that, I think, is the big picture this year,\u201d Panda said.", "label": "human"}

A new study finds that between 2017 and 2021, the number of very young children eating edible forms of marijuana spiked dramatically, with many kids ending up in hospitals.\n\nThe study, released Tuesday in the journal Pediatrics, found that in 2017, there were just over 200 reported cases of accidental consumption of cannabis edibles by children under six. In 2021, the number shot up to 3,054 \u2013 an increase of 1,375%.\n\nThe vast majority of the kids found the drug in their own home. While most children suffered mild impacts, 22.7% of exposed children needed hospitalization, and 8% of them \u2013 573 children \u2013 needed critical care.\n\nMarit Tweet, an emergency medicine doctor at SIU Medicine in Springfield, Illinois, is the lead author on the study. Tweet's curiosity on the topic piqued in 2019, when she started a fellowship at the Illinois Poison Control Center.\n\n\"The big buzz at that time was that cannabis was going to be legalized for recreational, adult use January 1st, 2020\" in Illinois, she said. State marijuana laws have been changing rapidly in the past decade, and the drug is legal for medical use in 37 states and for recreational use in 21 states and Washington, D.C.\n\nTweet was curious how recreational use had gone in other places, so she looked at studies from other states that had already legalized the drug. One study in Colorado documented that the number of children 10 years and under accidentally exposed to marijuana products rose between 2009 and 2015.\n\nSo Tweet wanted to know if this would also happen nationally, as more states legalized the drug. She was most concerned about kids 5-years-old and younger, a particularly vulnerable age for accidental poisoning.\n\n\"This age group accounts for about 40% of all calls to poison centers nationally,\" says Tweet. \"They can get into things, and you can't really rationalize with them\" about dangers.\n\nMarijuana edibles are made to look like sweets, she adds: \"They think it looks like candy, and maybe, they just want to eat it.\"\n\nTweet and her colleagues analyzed information from the National Poison Data System, which draws on calls to the 55 regional poison control centers that serve the United States and its territories.\n\nAndrew Monte, an emergency medicine doctor at University of Colorado hospital, urges parents who suspect their child ate an edible to take the child to a doctor right away.\n\n\"There are some patients that actually have airway obstruction and need to be in the ICU or put on a ventilator,\" says Monte, who was not involved in the study.\n\nMonte says he and his colleagues see these cases in their emergency department several times a month. Colorado was the first state to legalize marijuana for recreational use in 2012.\n\nDr. Nora Volkow, who directs the National Institute on Drug Abuse, says the study's findings are concerning.\n\n\"It's not just the issue that there are more poisonings of children consuming cannabis, but those consumptions appear to be more serious,\" says Volkow.\n\nThe study should also draw attention to how marijuana edibles are packaged and marketed, Volkow says.\n\n\"If you've ever been curious, go to a dispensary or a store where they sell cannabis products, which of course, me being a curious person, I've done,\" Volkow says. \"And the edibles are extremely appealing, in terms of packaging.\"\n\nShe says parents and caregivers who consume edible cannabis products should store them in child-proof containers and keep them out of the reach of children.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nA group of former Twitter employees who are suing the company spoke out Thursday, alleging that new owner Elon Musk\u2019s mass layoffs at the company have triggered multiple labor rights violations.\n\n\u201cReal people were affected by this, I have a family, I have kids to support,\u201d former Twitter engineer Wren Turkal said during a press conference in San Francisco. \u201cAll that we\u2019re looking for is fairness.\u201d\n\nAnother former Twitter engineer, Emmanuel Cornet, said during the event: \u201cIt seems like the layoffs have been done in a way that\u2019s really clumsy and inhumane and potentially illegal \u2026 and this is the aftermath.\u201d\n\nTwitter, which recently laid off much of its communications department, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuits or former employee comments.\n\nThe employees who spoke during the Thursday press conference are each plaintiffs in lawsuits filed by attorney Shannon Liss-Riordan against Twitter on behalf of former employees who were affected by Musk\u2019s takeover of the company.\n\nThe four suits, all of which are seeking class action status, include claims that Twitter reneged on promises to allow remote work and consistent severance benefits after the Musk acquisition, as well as complaints related to alleged disability and gender-based discrimination, and another suit on behalf of Twitter contractors who were laid off.\n\nThe press conference was held ahead of the first hearing in the initial case, in which a group of five former employees allege that Musk has violated promises the company made to employees prior to his takeover.\n\nThe suit alleges that employees were assured they could continue to work remotely for at least a year following the acquisition and were promised that any workers laid off under Musk would receive the same benefits and severance that employees had been entitled to prior to the takeover.\n\nThe lawsuit also claims that in the case of at least one employee terminated as part of the mass layoffs on November 1, Twitter did not provide sufficient notice required by federal and California laws, nor was he offered additional pay in lieu of the notice.\n\nThe attorney said Thursday she has also filed three claims against Twitter with the National Labor Relations Board on behalf of former employees.\n\nThe lawsuits were filed after Musk laid off around half of Twitter\u2019s staff last month, in an effort to slash costs following his $44 billion acquisition of the social media company. The company hadn\u2019t previously filed notice to state or local officials of the layoff plans, immediately raising questions about whether the terminations might violate California and federal WARN Acts, although at least some employees reportedly received sufficient pay to negate the need for such notice.\n\nDuring Thursday\u2019s hearing, lawyers for the former employees were set to ask a federal court for an order barring Twitter from seeking separation agreements with laid off employees without informing them of the lawsuit and their associated rights. As part of the requested order, they are also seeking to bar Twitter from communicating with employees in any way that could undermine their rights as part of the litigation.\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs are very concerned that employees will be asked to sign away their rights without notice that they have legal claims to additional benefits and severance and that these legal claims have already been filed on their behalf,\u201d the former employees said in their lawsuit.\n\nLiss-Riordan added during the press conference that, \u201cthe richest man in the world is not above the law. The employees have rights here.\u201d\n\nWeeks after the initial Twitter layoffs, hundreds more Twitter employees exited after Musk gave them an ultimatum to work \u201cextremely hardcore\u201d or leave the company.\n\n\u201cOf all the issues Elon Musk is facing right now, this feels like the easiest one to fix \u2026 treat your workers with respect,\u201d Liss-Riordan said.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "But with the advent of genetic testing and genomics, a whole new turning point is taking place in healthcare. With advances in technology and advancements in this field, it seems that doctors can now get along more personally with patients in their own genes. On Tuesday, July 26, 2022, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced the launch of its Genome Medicine Initiative, the first such initiative in the United States, which aims to develop personalized drugs for people with a variety of chronic diseases including cancer, Alzheimer's disease and diabetes. By using cutting-edge technology, the N.H.I.H. is working to harness the power of genomics to make personal care more accurate. By analyzing an individual's genetic makeup and associated health risks, healthcare providers will be able to create targeted treatment and preventive care programs that best meet each patient's specific health needs. Not only can this technology provide a more comprehensive approach to health care, but it also provides a better understanding of the individual's health risks and needs. By understanding a person's genetic makeup and risk, doctors can more effectively advise patients on how best to manage their medical care, including lifestyle recommendations, dietary changes, and prescription medications. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has also announced that they are working to incorporate AI into genomics, enabling healthcare providers to better understand individuals' health risks and develop tailored plans for their specific health needs. By collecting data on patients' health history, lifestyle choices, and genetic information, AI will be able to make personalized recommendations about treatment, help reduce medical speculation, and create a better and more effective healthcare experience for patients. With the implementation of the Genome Medicine Initiative, healthcare is entering a whole new field. By integrating the power of genomics and artificial intelligence into medical care, doctors can now help patients more personally, which will allow them to better identify risk factors and create customized therapies that are best for everyone. At the same time, this initiative will help reduce health disparities and ensure that everyone, regardless of their economic status or geographical location, has access to the healthcare they need. By harnessing cutting-edge technology, NIH aims to make health care more accessible, affordable, and effective for everyone. The Genome Medicine Initiative is just one of many projects implemented by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to improve healthcare access and efficacy. As technologies behind gene sequencing and artificial intelligence continue to advance, the health care industry may experience more innovation in the coming years. As genomic medicine advances, doctors will have the tools and resources they need to better understand and treat patients. This is an exciting time for healthcare, and with the help of the U.S. Institutes of Health, we can look forward to a more personalized and effective health care future for everyone.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un has called for a \"significant increase\" in his country's nuclear arsenal as tensions with South Korea and the United States continue to rise. In a national speech on Saturday, Kim also called his country's nuclear weapons \"the ultimate guarantee of our security and independence\" and warned the South Korean government to stop its \"hostile policy.\" \"We must have a sufficient number of strong nuclear arsenals to guarantee our security and independence in the face of any foreign aggression,\" Kim said in a speech broadcast on North Korea's state media. \"We will further improve the quality and quantity of nuclear weapons at an exponential rate.\" The statement comes after a stalemate between North Korea and South Korea over claims of conflict over the border region known as the \"Northern Boundary Line\" and increasingly hostile remarks by Pyongyang. Kim recently accused Seoul of \"dreaming\" to unify the peninsula, and warned that South Korean military \"provocations and threats\" would only increase his determination to \"protect and strengthen\" his nuclear arsenal. He also pointed to the recent deployment of U.S. strategic bombers on Guam as evidence of a \"hostile act\" against his country. \"The United States remains committed to the peaceful denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and will work with our partners and allies in the region to that end,\" said John Kirby, a spokesman for the State Department. The South Korean Foreign Ministry also issued a statement describing Kim's statement as a \"serious threat\" to regional security and peace. \"We cannot but express deep regret and concern over North Korea's continued pursuit of nuclear weapons and missile development,\" Cho Jun-hyuck, the ministry's spokesman, said in a written statement. In the face of rising tensions, the international community has put more pressure on Pyongyang, including through a UN Security Council resolution condemning North Korea's recent ballistic missile test. The resolution calls for renewed diplomatic efforts to \"create conditions conducive to dialogue\" and urges North Korea to return to the Six-Party Talks - a multinational effort to negotiate the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. However, Kim is not interested in resuming dialogue with South Korea, but instead emphasizes the need for his country to strengthen its nuclear arsenal. \"We will never accept any negotiations on reducing nuclear weapons under pressure from outside forces,\" he said. The United States remains committed to diplomacy, and Secretary of State John Kerry recently said he will visit South Korea in January to discuss \"a wide range of issues,\" including the security situation on the Korean peninsula. Kerry's visit will come at a critical moment of stalemate, as South Korean President Park Geun-hye's term ends in 2017 and the future of North Korea's relations is far from certain. At the same time, the world is watching closely as Kim Jong Un continues to strengthen and expand North Korea's nuclear arsenal, making the prospects for peace on the Korean peninsula increasingly dim.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Ten years ago, on Dec. 14, 2012, a gunman entered Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, CT, with two rifles and a handgun and killed 20 students between the ages of six and seven and six adults. It is the deadliest mass shooting at an elementary school in American history and the fourth deadliest overall. The attack renewed calls for stricter gun laws and universal background checks. Below, Sarah D\u2019Avino details the life-changing consequences of her sister\u2019s murder, and how she has transformed her pain into recovery.\n\nThat morning, my mom drove me to a doctor's appointment in West Hartford, as she did every week. Later, I was supposed to hang out with one of my girlfriends at my house. When mom and I got back home, my friend was already there. She looked shaken and told us, \u201cI have to go! I can't hang out today. I just got word there was a shooting at my nephew's school.\u201d That school was Sandy Hook Elementary.\n\nMy mom and I were in so much pain for her, seeing her look so distraught. We told her, \u201cGo! Go! Go!\u201d We go inside the house and turn on the news. We begin to hear aerial sounds above the house. Minutes later, Rachel's boyfriend, Anthony Cerritelli, rushed into the living room\u2014we all lived together\u2014and he goes, \u201cThat\u2019s Rachel's school.\u201d We thought Rachel was at Newtown Elementary School the entire time, but it was that very second we learned she had switched to Sandy Hook less than a week earlier.\n\nRachel had her master\u2019s from Post University in behavioral therapy, was working on her doctorate in the same field from the University of St. Joseph, and was about to become a board-certified behavioral analyst. She was doing her clinical hours with one of the Sandy Hook students on the autism spectrum, seven-year-old Josephine Gay, who also died that day. Rachel's job was to make the \u201cmainstream\u201d classroom inclusive for Josephine, accommodate her needs, and help her integrate with the other students.\n\nRachel, left, with Hannah, center, and Sarah. Courtesy Sarah D'Avino\n\nAfter Tony tells us she\u2019s at Sandy Hook, we panic when we don\u2019t hear from Rachel. We looked at our phones repeatedly, hoping and waiting to hear from her. When we got no response, my mom drove us to the Town Hall. We weren\u2019t there long before the police caravanned us across town to the firehouse, which became the official family meeting area. Then, one by one, we witnessed families being told their child wasn't coming home. It was painful, especially not knowing what was happening with Rachel.\n\nThe shooting was at nine in the morning. By nine that night, we still had no word. At this point, it's just my mom and me sitting at the fire station. Because Rachel was so new, her name wasn't on any list. But the officers knew they had a family looking for a \u201cRachel D'Avino,\u201d and they knew they had a body whose name they didn\u2019t know, but they didn't want to tell us anything until they were sure. Finally, an officer walks over to us. It must\u2019ve been killing this man to watch us wonder all day. When he got to where we were, I assume he broke every protocol when he said, \u201cAnybody who was in that school, and we don't know who they are, is gone.\u201d I collapsed on my mother. We screamed on top of each other. A priest came over, put his hands on us, and said a prayer. I grabbed his hand.\n\nWe left shortly after that and drove home to tell my younger sister, Hannah. I remember just taking deep breaths, clenching that steering wheel with all my might, and thinking, Just suck it up and get mom home. Then, around 2:30 in the morning\u2014now it's a Saturday\u2014we get a knock on the door. There are police officers, social workers, and that same priest at our door. They hand us a packet on how to go about making funeral arrangements. That was our confirmation: Rachel had been identified by her tattoos.\n\nOne by one, we witnessed families being told their child wasn't coming home.\n\nThat night, I had been clean four years: From 16 to 21, I abused substances, mostly opioids. After hearing the news, I didn\u2019t know how to feel what I was feeling. So, I returned to what I knew \u2014 I relapsed and had a drink. What started as using to numb the pain after a few years became using against my will. In the 10 years since Rachel died, the first half was spent using to not feel, then there was about a year of using because I didn't know how to stop. I was stuck in a cycle of active addiction, where I would watch myself, wish I wasn't doing it, but not know how to stop. And finally, one day, I just put my hands up and said, God, either kill me or fix me because I can't do this anymore. I found a 12-step program and committed to it. I worked very hard on recognizing patterns in my life and why I choose substances when I'm in pain. On Feb. 26, I will have four years completely clean and sober. I am in grief and trauma counseling and finally unclenching that steering wheel. If I had a magic wand, I would not change that process. I needed every single one of those stepping stones to be who I am today. I have a sponsor who tells me, \u201cYou can't climb a smooth mountain.\u201d\n\nOne week after the shooting, on Dec. 21, we held Rachel\u2019s funeral at The Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, CT. I gave her eulogy. That was the most important thing I could do for her. I spoke about how\u2014Rachel being the oldest of us three sisters\u2014our foundation was rocked. The church was standing room only with a video camera doing live feed to the church hall because that was filled with people, too. The sign-in book from that day has 695 signatures, many of which just say the so-and-so family\u2014so it was probably close to 1,000 who came to honor Rachel. It was beautiful to see how much she was loved and remembered.\n\nFor the first year after the shooting, I felt paraded around. There were memorials, trips to D.C., interviews, family and friends showing up at the house, and standing in front of cameras and reporters. I felt very exposed. Today, I'll go through something painful, like a breakup, and my friends would say, \u201cWow, you talk so freely about your pain.\u201d And I'll tell them, \u201cWell, you have to imagine what it's like for your grief process to be on the 11 o'clock news.\u201d\n\nRachel and her mom. Courtesy Sarah D'Avino\n\nI believe the day Sarah left us, she became my guardian angel. I\u2019ve survived overdoses where there was no medical explanation as to why. I was told since I was a teenager I\u2019d never carry a pregnancy to term. Now, I\u2019m a mom.\n\nI\u2019ve often thought about my relationship with Rachel and how my addiction and mental health issues drove a wedge between us. I wasn\u2019t an easy sister to be around, and we didn\u2019t get along, and I deeply regret that. There are no pictures of us past middle school. I regret that I can't go back and fix our relationship. But what\u2019s in my control now is how I apply the lessons from her loss to those still in my life: I document memories of myself and my loved ones; I will tell you I love you more; I will forgive faster; I will agree to disagree quicker. Because I can't undo any of that with Rachel.\n\nGrowing up, Rachel was the ringleader. In kindergarten, her teacher called her one-gate Rachel because it didn't matter if there was a fire drill or an ice cream truck outside, Rachel was only going at the pace Rachel wanted to go at. She remained that way into adulthood. She was bright and focused, an independent thinker who was always driven and always had a heart to help others, even before herself. I grieve for the loss of who Rachel would have become. I grieve for the children she would have had and the doting aunt she would have been. Rachel would\u2019ve raised the world's most well-rounded and highly self-esteem-possessing children. She would\u2019ve had an opportunity to see who I've become. She would love this Sarah and want to spend time with me and tell me she loves me. It doesn't just end with losing 29-year-old Rachel; it is a lifelong loss.\n\nI know with all of my heart that Rachel is always protecting me, guiding me, and sending love and light my way.\n\nWhen my grandfather passed away, my grandmother gave me her engagement ring. It caused a bit of a stir between us because, as the oldest, Rachel felt it would be hers. A few months before she died, I don't know why, but I put the ring by the coffee pot early one morning with a note that said Rachel, this always should have been yours. Love, Sarah. The ring had been missing a stone or two. Tony, her boyfriend, had the ring cleaned and replaced the stones. A few weeks before the shooting, he asked my mom and my stepfather for permission to propose to Rachel on Christmas Eve. She didn\u2019t know. She would\u2019ve said yes.\n\nI once heard a quote that a person dies twice: Once when they take their last breath and the second time when their name is spoken for the last time. If that's the case, Rachel is going to live forever. There are monuments in her honor, and she's still a part of our family. Gregory, my 18-month-old son, knows he has an Auntie Rachel. She's talked about just as much as any other family member. He\u2019s been to her gravesite. We\u2019ve told him stories about how she could sometimes be mischievous. How we\u2019d put on a little play for our mom after dinner. Gregory may never meet his auntie, but he will always know her.\n\nThroughout my grieving process, I\u2019ve thought about my mother the most. Because, as a new mom, I\u2019d look at my son and just get lost in my love for him. I would go hungry for him. I would go sleepless for him. But I only have the one. I could only imagine what it\u2019s been like for my mom. When you have more than one child, there isn't love more for any specific one of them, but there is that one that made you a mother. With Rachel\u2019s death, my mom lost the child that made her a mother. I can\u2019t even grasp what that would feel like, so that\u2019s stayed with me.\n\nRachel and her dog Diezel, who accompanied her when working with special needs clients. Courtesy Sarah D'Avino\n\nIn this 10-year grieving process, I\u2019ve learned that it's okay to hurt. It's okay to feel pain. It's okay to think nobody understands or that it'll never go away. I\u2019ve learned to not run away from grief and pain. That recovery is possible, that there's no rock bottom with addiction, there\u2019s just death. That hope is out there and doesn't end until life does. I\u2019m no longer afraid to admit that when Rachel died, yes, I turned to substances\u2014it was the only thing I knew then to quench my pain. When life happens again, and it will, I know that I\u2019m not exempt from grief and trauma and pain. None of us are. It is one of those hard-to-swallow pills of life. But now, I have a program of recovery, a toolbox of healthy coping skills, and a network of angels on earth to catch me. I know with all of my heart that Rachel is always protecting me, guiding me, and sending love and light my way.\n\nI\u2019ve also learned that trying to dull my pain with any substances only causes more, new, and different pain. I learned that the answer is not in a bag. The answer is not in a bottle. I did not find Rachel in any pill. I did not find her inside any needle. All that did was take me farther away from her memory. And now, being clean, being in recovery, living every day, one day at a time, for myself, I know that I am Sarah. I am not the things that have happened to my family and me. I am not the pain I've gone through. I don't have to spend the rest of my life being Sarah, Rachel's little sister who lost her to a tragic incident.

White House officials shared the news with Republican lawmakers in a recent series of conversations, one person familiar with the negotiations told CNN. This marks an ongoing tension between the executive branch and members of Congress who are trying to investigate the behavior of the Trump administration during its four years in office. The White House has been steadfast in refusing to work with Republican lawmakers, prompting the Republican-led House and Senate to file a lawsuit. In addition to notifying the Republican chairman that a supervisory request must be restarted when the 117th Congress is convened, White House officials have advised Republicans to seek new areas of investigation for the new Congress. The conversation between the White House and congressional Republican chairpersons comes at a time when Biden's team is trying to build a new relationship with Capitol Hill. President Joe Biden has sought to pursue a bipartisan agenda, pushing for his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief program with the support of some Republican lawmakers, while admitting that he is unlikely to have anyone else join him. The former vice president has vowed to engage with the Republican Party in an effort to find common ground. But in recent days, Republicans have issued a harsh condemnation of the White House. After Biden's interior minister candidate Deb Haaland was confirmed on Tuesday, Rep. Bob Good of Virginia, the top Republican on the House Natural Resources Committee, blasted the move in a statement. \"It's no secret that President Biden's Home Office candidate Deb Haaland is a proponent of progress, green energy policy and an opponent of oil and gas,\" Good said. \"The policies she advocates during her campaign, such as the Green New Deal, will have an adverse economic impact on the struggling U.S. energy community and a devastating effect on our national security.\" The shooting took place at a critical moment. Biden and his assistants are trying to turn a page on the turbulent Trump administration, eager to set the agenda and tone for the first few days of Biden's presidency. But the war drag between the White House and Republican-led Congress could be an obstacle to the government's pursuit of a bipartisan system. In the context of a supervisory request, Republican lawmakers and their aides told CNN they intended to continue seeking records and documents related to Trump's administration, regardless of the position of the White House. The party has a weak majority in the House of Representatives, which means any investigation must be carried out before removing the Democratic-led committee. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Republican aides said conversations with White House officials had taken place in recent weeks, but would not confirm whether the Republican chairman and government officials met. Congressional oversight of the executive branch is a sensitive issue, as there are frequent lawsuits between the executive and legislative branches during President Trump's tenure. Controversial is a number of requests by Republicans and Democrats for documents from the executive branch, which the Trump administration routinely refuses to provide. The long-standing callback between congressional Democrats and the Trump White House eventually led to several lawsuits, several of which involved a Republican-led Senate. It's unclear whether these lawsuits will be prosecuted, or whether the White House will agree to those demands at the start of the new Congress. The Democratic-led House of Representatives is expected to investigate when Congress returns in January, but Republican lawmakers have made clear they are eager to restart investigations into the previous administration. Biden and his team have expressed concern that the investigation could distract the president's agenda. This could be a problem in the near future, as Democrats are expected to turn their attention to the 2022 midterm elections. When they seek to protect their majority in the House and Senate, Democrats may see the GOP-led investigation as a transfer of party information, raising fears that both sides will not be able to find common ground. That tension was evident after Harland confirmed it, when Republican lawmakers criticized the Biden administration's candidate for positions on energy and other issues. This dynamic could become even more dangerous as congressional Republican leaders try to restart their oversight requests.", "label": "machine"}

Inside the white Tesla, about 250 to 300 feet down a cliff next to the Pacific Ocean, were two children, a 4-year-old boy and a 7-year-old girl, and two adults, both 41, who all survived.\n\nMultiple agencies including the California Highway Patrol, the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office, and the U.S. Coast Guard responded.\n\nFirefighters rappelled down the cliff and rescued the children first, while a helicopter rescue technician was lowered to the scene and helped rescue the adults.

{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe House January 6 committee on Thursday released a new batch of transcripts, including interviews with Donald Trump Jr., former Trump White House aides and others.\n\nThe latest transcripts covered a range of topics and revealed new details from the January 6 committee\u2019s investigation, including the former president\u2019s son explaining a text message to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows after the 2020 election, insights into former first lady Melania Trump\u2019s distrust of people in her husband\u2019s inner circle and some of the chaos surrounding the law enforcement response to the rioters breaching the Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\nThis new batch is part of a steady stream of transcript drops that the select committee has put out over the past week, complementing its sweeping 845-page report. The latest release comes as the panel winds down its work with the House majority set to change hands from Democrats to Republicans next week at the start of the new Congress.\n\nSo far, the released transcripts have provided illuminating insights into the final weeks of former President Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, with accounts from inside the Trump White House, from federal and state officials who resisted pressure to overturn the 2020 election results, and many others.\n\nHere are some of the highlights from Thursday\u2019s disclosures:\n\nDonald Trump Jr. explains why he texted Meadows on November 5 about plans to keep his father in office\n\nDonald Trump Jr. told the committee that the reason he texted Meadows a detailed plan about how to ensure his father would get a second term two days after the 2020 presidential election was because he thought the ideas were \u201cthe most sophisticated\u201d and \u201csounded plausible.\u201d\n\nTrump Jr.\u2019s testimony, revealed by the select committee on Thursday, provides new context to a text message CNN first reported on in April where he lays out various ideas for keeping Trump in power by subverting the Electoral College process.\n\nThe November 5 text message outlines a strategy that is nearly identical to what allies of the former President attempted to carry out in the months that followed. Trump Jr. makes specific reference to filing lawsuits and advocating recounts to prevent certain swing states from certifying their results, as well as having a handful of Republican state houses put forward slates of fake \u201cTrump electors.\u201d\n\nIf all that failed, according to the Trump Jr. text, GOP lawmakers in Congress could simply vote to reinstall Trump as President on January 6, 2021.\n\n\u201cWe have operational control Total leverage,\u201d the message reads. \u201cMoral High Ground POTUS must start 2nd term now.\u201d\n\nAlthough Trump Jr. said that he was not the original author of the text, a point his lawyer made to CNN back in April, and that he did not remember who the original author of the message was, he explained to investigators why out of all the messages he was being sent at the time, he felt this one was necessary to pass on to Meadows.\n\n\u201cPerhaps in reading it, it was the most sophisticated, you know, and detailed, and again, about things I don\u2019t necessarily, you know, know too much about, but it sounded plausible and I wanted to make sure that we were looking into the issues brought up in the text,\u201d Trump Jr. said.\n\nMeadows did not initially respond to the original November 5 text, but when Trump Jr. followed up the next day to make sure he saw, Trump\u2019s then-chief of staff texted, \u201cmuch of this had merit. Working on this for PA, so Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina already.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump Jr., fianc\u00e9e don\u2019t recall details and distance themselves from events that led to January 6, transcripts show\n\nDonald Trump Jr. told the committee he couldn\u2019t recall key details related to his appearance at a rally that preceded the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nTrump Jr. said he didn\u2019t know Turning Point Action paid him and his fianc\u00e9e Kimberly Guilfoyle $30,000 each for their appearances at the rally on the White House ellipse. He said he thought the money was for an event at the Palm Beach Hilton in December, according to a transcript released Thursday.\n\n\u201cMy recollection was that we had spoken for them prior to Christmas at an event that we did annually and always got sort of paid for speaking fees to show up,\u201d Trump Jr. said.\n\nIn transcripts of their interviews with the House select committee, Trump Jr. and Guilfoyle repeatedly said they didn\u2019t recall details and distanced themselves from the events that led to the January 6 attack. Trump Jr. told committee investigators, \u201cI don\u2019t recall specifically,\u201d when asked if he ever received the $30,000 and \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d when asked if Guilfoyle ever ended up getting paid.\n\nThroughout their testimony, Trump Jr. and Guilfoyle said they didn\u2019t remember specific conversations about rally planning and that they were in the dark about the particulars as it was being put together.\n\nGuilfoyle also denied having conversations with anyone linking the rally to objections to Congress certifying Joe Biden\u2019s electoral win.\n\n\u201cI was not involved in any of that certification stuff. I couldn\u2019t explain it to you to this day,\u201d she said, adding that she didn\u2019t know the significance of holding the rally on January 6.\n\n\u2018Just give me five dead voters\u2019: Sen. Lindsey Graham said after 2020 election, Trump lawyer tells committee\n\nAfter the 2020 election, Sen. Lindsey Graham pledged to become a \u201cchampion\u201d of then-President Trump\u2019s election fraud claims \u2013 if only Trump\u2019s advisers would give him information about dead voters, according to an account given to the January 6 committee.\n\n\u201cSenator Graham was saying, \u2018Get me your information,\u2019\u201d Trump lawyer Christina Bobb relayed to the committee about what Graham said in a meeting days before the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\n\u201cJust give me five dead voters,\u201d Bobb said Graham told then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and others in Meadows\u2019 office at the White House.\n\n\u201cGive me, you know, an example of illegals voting. Just give me a very small snapshot that I can take and champion,\u201d Bobb added, relaying what Graham said at the time.\n\nThe exchange with Graham highlights how the South Carolina Republican became involved in Trump\u2019s pressure campaign to overturn his election loss in Georgia, and how the White House at the time was connecting with influential politicians to advance Trump\u2019s message of false election fraud claims.\n\n\u201cGraham was like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019d love to support the cause. I think it would be great to, you know, really show all the fraud. Send me a memo and show me, you know, what information you have got. I\u2019ll champion it,\u2019\u201d Bobb also recalled from the conversation with Graham.\n\nAccording to a transcript of Bobb\u2019s House testimony released Thursday, Graham received a memo from the legal team working with Trump, titled \u201cChairman Graham dead votes memo for your consideration.\u201d\n\nBut Bobb added: \u201cHe did nothing with it.\u201d\n\nGraham\u2019s office pointed out on Thursday that the book \u201cPeril\u201d by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa previously described a similar exchange between Graham and the Trump advisers. After receiving their memo, the senator was unconvinced of the fraud they claimed, the book said. His office didn\u2019t provide any further response.\n\nGrisham says she learned Trump thought rioters \u2018looked very trashy\u2019 but loved that they were \u2018fighting for him\u2019\n\nStephanie Grisham, a former White House press secretary and chief of staff to Melania Trump, said she learned from people inside the West Wing on January 6, 2021, that Trump thought the rioters \u201clooked very trashy,\u201d but reveled in how they were \u201cfighting for him.\u201d\n\nGrisham told the committee: \u201cI heard from several people in the West Wing, more on the military aide or Secret Service side, and then a couple just people, but that he was sitting in the dining room, and he was just watching it all unfold, and that a couple of his comments \u2013 some of his comments were that these people looked very trashy, but also look at what fighters they were.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was kind of reveling in the fact that these people were fighting for him. But he also didn\u2019t like how they looked,\u201d Grisham said.\n\nMelania Trump didn\u2019t trust her husband\u2019s inner circle, the former first lady\u2019s chief of staff says\n\nGrisham also detailed the former first lady\u2019s distrust in people close to her husband after the 2020 election, including Donald Trump Jr.\n\n\u201cCertainly when it came to the kids, especially Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle, she never trusted that they were doing things in the best interest of their \u2013 of Don Jr.\u2019s father,\u201d Grisham told the committee.\n\nGrisham said Melania also distrusted \u201cpeople that she thought were giving her husband bad advice,\u201d like lawyers Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani and campaign staffers. \u201cShe would say, I think they\u2019re giving him bad advice, I don\u2019t think this is smart.\u201d\n\nFormer Trump acting defense secretary endorsed giving DC mayor more control of DC National Guard\n\nChris Miller, who served as acting defense secretary at the end of the Trump administration, told the committee he thought the Washington, DC, mayor should have greater control of the DC National Guard in the wake of the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\nMiller was asked in his January deposition about a proposal in Congress to give the Washington, DC, mayor the same authority to deploy the National Guard that a governor has. Because the District of Columbia is not a state, the authority to deploy is delegated to the Army secretary by the defense secretary and president.\n\nMiller said of the DC mayor being given more authority over the Guard: \u201cBeing a private citizen, I\u2019ll tell you exactly what I think, and take it or leave. Heck, yeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe mayor should absolutely have greater control over the DC National Guard,\u201d he continued, according to a transcript released by the panel Thursday. \u201cI do not know the history. And I\u2019m sure there\u2019s all sorts of reasons that are constitutional, way beyond what I understand, so I\u2019m just kind of popping off, but there\u2019s got to be a way to integrate her or the mayor into this process of work meaningfully and more proactively.\u201d\n\nMiller testified to the committee about the lag in getting National Guard soldiers to the Capitol on January 6, saying that he didn\u2019t know why Major Gen. William Walker, the DC National Guard Commander, believed he didn\u2019t have approval to deploy. According to the January 6 committee\u2019s report, Walker \u201cunderstood he had to wait for approval from Secretary (Ryan) McCarthy to deploy his forces. But as he waited on that video call for hours, he did strongly consider sending them anyway.\u201d", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The family of a man accused of murdering an Idaho man with the head of a gun said they \"promoted his presumption of innocence\" and were awaiting further details of the investigation. Eugene Lott, 24, was arrested last week and charged with murder in connection with Travis Martin's death. On December 27, Martin, the father of two married children, was found dead at his home in Nampa. Lot is currently being held without bail and will appear in court in February. In a statement, Lot's family expressed support for him but also expressed sympathy for the Martin family. \"We join our community in mourning the loss of life and express our deepest sympathy and condolences to Travis Martin's family and all those affected by this tragedy,\" the statement said, adding: \"We promote and express our support for our son and brother Eugene Lott and advance his presumption of innocence as the case passes through the justice system.\" The statement went on to say that Lot's family is confident \"that they will be fully acquitted of all charges\" and that the family \"will continue to actively support him through this process.\" Police have not released any details of their investigation, but it appears that the case will be based primarily on indirect evidence. Martin has reportedly been living at Lot's home for the past few weeks, and there is a dispute over the relationship between the two. The family claims that he was becoming increasingly aggressive and had threatened Lot in the past. Police did not disclose the motive for the case, but it is believed that the two were involved in a dispute on the day of the murder. Neighbours also reported hearing intense quarrels and gunshots from Lot's family on the day of the murder. However, no weapons were found at the scene, and investigators did not disclose any evidence that the killer was Lot. The family strongly believes that Lot is not the murderer and that the truth will emerge during the investigation. \"We will continue to have full confidence in the innocence of our son and brother, and believe that as the case progresses through the justice system, the truth will surface,\" it said.

{"text": "Stock markets have been crying this month, with major averages rising by double digits throughout the year, and the Nasdaq Composite Index and S&P 500 index hit a record high this week. Analysts have been pouring into the retail boom that has benefited from a pandemic stimulus, as well as stocks that are expected to perform well in the long run. Here's what some of Wall Street's top analysts suggested on Thursday. The Apple (AAPL) Analysts at Needham upgraded Apple's stock to buy, and raised its price target from $117 to $146. They cited Apple's continued sales strength, cash balance, and commitment to innovation and customer experience. \"Apple remains the most powerful tech company in terms of cash flow and dividend growth. We expect this trend to continue as Apple rolls out compelling devices and services,\" Needham analyst Laura Martin said in a note to customers. Tesla (TSLA) Goldman Sachs upgraded Tesla's shares to a neutral acquisition, citing better margins and strong demand for the Model 3. The company raised the price target of the electric vehicle manufacturer from $425 to $780. \"We're becoming more constructive with Tesla and our new price target is $780, up about 44 percent from yesterday's close,\" Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney said in a note. IMAX (IMAX) Deutsche Bank upgraded IMAX to a position buy and raised its price target from $12 to $19. The company noted that it had \"doubled its customer base in the past year\" thanks to a strong industry recovery and the introduction of some new technologies. \"We believe that the stock has been undervalued for some time and is likely to rise further as it reaches its peak margin,\" said Paul Trussell, an analyst in a report. Netflix (NFLX) Barclays has lifted Netflix's stock from equal to overweight and raised its price target from $445 to $585. The company notes that the streaming giant has expanded its global user base to nearly 200 million people, and is adding new users every quarter. \"Netflix is one of the best companies to benefit from moving to streaming, and we expect growth to continue as the economy recovers,\" said analyst Carlos Kirjner in a note. Robin Hood (RHB) Morgan Stanley raised Robinhood's stock from equal to overweight on the grounds of increased user engagement and expected growth in subscription-based services. The company raised its price target from $31 to $50. \"We believe that the company's recent momentum is likely to continue, and given its strong customer base and user engagement metrics, we are positive about the company's long-term growth prospects,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Stan Bicic said in a note. Amazon (AMZN) UBS raised Amazon's shares from neutral to buy, and increased its price target from $3,000 to $3,600. UBS noted that Amazon has the ability to benefit from a shift towards e-commerce and growing demand for its cloud services. \"We believe Amazon's competitive advantage and its role in helping change shopping behavior makes it a core long-term holding,\" UBS analyst Eric Sheridan said in a note. Wal - Mart Deutsche Bank has upgraded Walmart's stock to a position buy and raised its price target from $153 to $174. The company notes that Walmart is benefiting from the retail boom triggered by the pandemic, and expects to benefit from an ongoing shift to e-commerce. Walmart is successfully tackling the pandemic, increasing its market share and investing in its full channel capabilities.

{"text": "Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky and U.S. President Joe Biden met on Monday to highlight the need to address Russia's ongoing aggression in the region. Speaking to the media in Kiev, the two leaders called on Russia to stop its invasion of Ukrainian territory and warned that the situation was approaching a critical turning point. Zelensky and Biden also discussed how to strengthen the resilience of Ukraine and other countries in the region against Russian aggression. \"The United States will not stand idly by while Russia continues to threaten the security of Ukraine and its neighbors,\" Biden said. \"We stand ready to help Ukraine strengthen its ability to defend itself and deter Russian aggression.\" He went on to say that the U.S. will help Ukraine strengthen its defense capabilities and ensure that it receives the necessary resources needed to build a national defense force. Biden also called on Russia to stop its \"malicious activities\" in Ukraine, noting that the United States is ready to work with allies in the region to \"preserve sovereignty and territorial integrity.\" The two leaders also spoke about the need for more economic support to Ukraine, as well as a more effective fight against corruption. \"We are committed to working with the government of Ukraine to combat corruption and economic mismanagement in order to ensure the country's economic future,\" Biden said. At the same time, Ukrainian President Zelensky noted that the United States is providing \"not only moral but also material support\" to Ukraine. \"This support helps Ukraine defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity, counter the aggression of Moscow, and build a secure future,\" he said. The meeting between the two leaders comes as tensions in the region remain high and Russian-backed forces continue their offensive in eastern Ukraine. The conflict in the region has been ongoing since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and began supporting separatist movements in eastern Ukraine. The meeting between Zelensky and Biden comes ahead of the first official visit by the U.S. president to Kiev, which is expected to take place later this month. During his visit, Biden is expected to meet with Ukrainian leaders and discuss ways to advance the implementation of the Minsk agreements aimed at ending the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The visit was also an attempt by Biden and his team to rebuild relations with Russia, which have deteriorated dramatically under the administration of former President Donald Trump. At a joint news conference on Monday, Biden reiterated America's commitment to Ukraine and vowed to continue standing with the country in the face of Russian aggression. \"It is imperative that we stand united against Russian aggression and support Ukraine's efforts to build a better future,\" Biden said. \"The United States is, and will continue to be, a strong partner for Ukraine.\" Zelensky thanked Biden for his \"unprecedented strong support\" and said the United States was vital in helping Ukraine become a strong and prosperous country. The U.S. has supported Ukraine since independence in 1991, and the country is now \"on the brink of a critical turning point in its history.\" The two leaders also discussed ways to strengthen the partnership between the two countries and promote greater international cooperation in order to address security challenges in the region. \"It's important for us to continue making progress on our shared interests in security, economic development and democracy,\" Biden said. Finally, Biden and Zelensky agreed to continue working together to help build a strong and secure Ukraine and work together to address the security threats posed by Russia in the region.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Researchers at the University of Vermont analyzed 1,000 TikTok videos under the most popular hashtags related to body image and eating Jakub Porzycki | NurPhoto | Getty Images\n\nTikTok ban on government devices\n\nThe banning of TikTok on government devices could benefit rival platforms like Snap and Meta's Facebook and Instagram that also fight for young consumers' attention. The bill includes an exception for law enforcement, national security and research purposes. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, as well as FBI Director Christopher Wray, have voiced fear that TikTok's ownership structure could make U.S. user data vulnerable, since companies based in China are required by law to hand over data if the government requests it. TikTok has repeatedly said its U.S. user data is not based in China, though those assurances have done little to alleviate concern. The company has been working toward a deal with the administration to assuage national security fears through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. \"We're disappointed that Congress has moved to ban TikTok on government devices \u2014 a political gesture that will do nothing to advance national security interests \u2014 rather than encouraging the Administration to conclude its national security review,\" a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement following the release of the package text. \"The agreement under review by CFIUS will meaningfully address any security concerns that have been raised at both the federal and state level. These plans have been developed under the oversight of our country's top national security agencies \u2014 plans that we are well underway in implementing \u2014 to further secure our platform in the United States, and we will continue to brief lawmakers on them.\"\n\nDeterring online counterfeit sales\n\nThe spending package also includes the INFORM Consumers Act, which seeks to deter counterfeit, stolen or harmful products from being sold online. The bill requires online marketplaces like Amazon to promptly collect information like bank and contact details from \"any high-volume third party seller\" and to verify that data. Though Amazon initially opposed the bill last year, writing that it was \"pushed by some big-box retailers\" and claiming it would punish small businesses that sell online, the company ended up supporting a version of the bill, saying it was important to have a federal standard rather than a patchwork of state laws. Etsy and eBay had earlier supported the bill. \"Passing the bipartisan INFORM Act would be a major victory for consumers, who deserve to know who they're buying from when they visit an online marketplace,\" Kovacevich said in a statement. \"This legislation has been through years of hearings and markups and has earned the support of both parties as well as brick-and-mortar stores and online marketplaces.\" Etsy's head of Americas advocacy and public policy, Jeffrey Zubricki, said in a statement the bill \"will achieve our shared goal of protecting consumers from bad actors while avoiding overly broad disclosure requirements that would harm our sellers' privacy and hinder their ability to run their creative businesses.\"\n\nHigher fees for big mergers\n\nWhile more ambitious antitrust measures targeting digital platforms didn't make it into the end-of-year legislation, there is one bill to help raise money for the antitrust agencies that scrutinize mergers. The Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act will raise the cost companies pursuing large mergers must pay to file with the antitrust agencies, as they're required to do under the law. The bill also lowers the cost for smaller deals and allows the fees to be adjusted each year based on the consumer price index. The measure is meant to help fund the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice Antitrust Division, which have seen a large uptick in merger filings over the past few years without adequate budget increases. While it fell short of antitrust advocates' hopes, the inclusion of the merger filing fee bill still gained praise. \"This is a major milestone for the anti-monopoly movement,\" said Sarah Miller, executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project, backed in part by the Omidyar Network. Miller said the bill will \"significantly strengthen antitrust law for the first time since 1976.\" \"Big Tech, Big Ag and Big Pharma spent extraordinary sums in an unprecedented effort to keep Congress from delivering on antitrust reform and undermine the ability of state and federal enforcers to uphold the law \u2014 and they lost,\" Miller added. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who sponsored the bill, said in a statement earlier this week its inclusion \"is an important step to restructure merger fees after decades of the status quo so we can provide our antitrust enforcers with the resources they need to do their jobs.\" \"This is clearly the beginning of this fight and not the end,\" she said. \"I will continue to work across the aisle to protect consumers and strengthen competition.\"\n\nEmpowering state AGs in antitrust cases\n\nAnother antitrust bill included in the package was a version of the State Antitrust Enforcement Venue Act. The bill gives state attorneys general the same power as federal enforcers in antitrust cases to choose the district in which they bring their cases and prevent them from being consolidated in a different district. Under the legislation, companies defending against claims of antitrust violations won't be able to pick what they perceive to be a more favorable venue to fight the case. That's what happened in an antitrust case against Google brought by a group of state attorneys general accusing the company of illegally monopolizing the digital advertising market. The company transferred the case from Texas to New York, to be heard alongside private antitrust complaints against the company in the pretrial proceedings. Last year, attorneys general from 52 states and territories wrote Congress in support of the legislation.\n\nTransparency on ransomware attacks\n\nThe bipartisan RANSOMWARE Act also made it into the spending bill, requiring the FTC to report to Congress on the number and types of foreign ransomware or other cyberattack complaints it receives. The FTC also must report to Congress trends in numbers it sees in these complaints, including those that come from individuals, companies or governments of foreign adversaries like China, North Korea, Iran and Russia. And it must share information on its litigation actions related to these cases and their results. The FTC can also share recommendations for new laws to strengthen resilience against these attacks as well as for best practices that businesses can follow to protect themselves.\n\nResearch into tech impacts on kids\n\nA version of the Children and Media Research Advancement (CAMRA) Act is included in the package, directing the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct or support research on the effects of media and technology on infants, kids and adolescents. Those effects could include the impact on cognitive, mental and physical health by technologies like social media, artificial intelligence, video games or virtual reality, according to the legislation. The director of the National Institutes of Health must deliver a report to Congress on its work within two years of the law's enactment. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.

{"text": "2022 was a bumpy year in the markets, even for portfolio mangers who purposefully went out of their way to avoid turmoil. But the Janus Henderson Investors' Balanced Fund has been able to shield itself from at least part of the year's volatility by reducing exposure to equities and leaning more on fixed income. \"The intention has always been to provide our investors with a smoother ride over time, with less volatility to returns by combining growth equities with fixed income,\" said Jeremiah Buckley, a portfolio manager. In a year of broad market losses, that strategy has allowed the fund to outperform, at least on a relative basis. The retail share class (JABAX) lost 16.4% in 2022. That gives it a slight edge over the S & P 500 , which dropped nearly 20% last year . Morningstar rates the 30-year-old fund five stars among peers with 50% to 70% of allocations in equities. It has an annual expense ratio of 0.82%. 'Harder to find a safe place' In recent years, the fund's focus on growth stocks has helped drive gains. The fund gained 22%, 14% and 17% annually in 2019 through 2021, respectively, as technology stocks outperformed. (JABAX ranks in the 8th percentile among its peer funds over the past five years, and the 4th percentile over the past 15, Morningstar says.) Winds shifted in 2022, however, as investors traded growth for value names as interest rates rose and concerns mounted over a looming recession. Buckley said he recognized early in the year that the inflationary environment could trigger Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, creating a harsh environment for both stocks and fixed income. But he felt more confident in how bond holdings would respond. In turn, he cut the percentage of the fund's stock exposure to 55%, as of Nov. 30, from around 64%. Fixed income accounted for about 44%. \"This year has been tricky, obviously, because there's been such a high correlation between fixed income and equity returns,\" he said. \"It's been harder to find a safe place, essentially, during this year.\" The fund's recent history shows a trend of underperforming during strong up years for the S & P 500, while being able to outperform in downdrafts. In 2018, for example, the last time the S & P 500 saw a down year, the Janus Henderson fund, which today runs assets of some $23.7 billion, eked out a 0.5% return. Buckley said it's normal to adjust the fund's allocation in times of turmoil. Equity allocations came down in 1999 ahead of the 2000-2002 bear market. Stock exposure came down again again in 2006 before the 2008 financial crisis, then rose back in 2009 to coincide with recovery. In early 2020, Janus Henderson lowered the fund's equity allocation, but quickly added exposure again as the market improved. Microsoft , which Buckley characterizes as a \"core growth\" stock, made up the largest share of the fund as of Nov. 30, at 4.4%. The top 10 holdings comprised nearly 23% of fund assets . Within fixed income, Buckley said the fund has been more conservative by reducing exposure to corporate credit. The fund has moved from a focus on short duration to becoming more neutral amid growing hope the Federal Reserve will continue slowing its hikes in interest rates. The central bank raised borrowing costs half a percentage point in December after four straight increases of three quarters of a point earlier in the year. Long-term outperformer Most recently, Janus Henderson Balanced underperformed 77% of its peer group in 2022, pushed down by the recent rally in value stocks, according to Morningstar analyst Karen Zaya. But Zaya said the returns are attractive for long-term investors over longer time periods, especially given its relatively lower risk. When looking at its Sharpe ratio, which measures risk-adjusted returns, Zaya found that from December 2012 through November 2022, the balanced fund outperformed 97% of its peer group. \"Diversifying your portfolio with bonds has historically added stability,\" she said. \"You may sacrifice some returns ... but in the long run, it gives you a less volatile experience and can help keep an investor invested through the ups and the downs.\" Another aspect of the portfolio is its emphasis on domestic rather than overseas securities compared with peers, which are typically more internationally diversified, Zaya said. That's helped in recent years as U.S. equities outperformed international stocks. Despite the challenges of 2022, Buckley is optimistic about 2023. The fund has been watching for stocks with high yields and strong balance sheets that would help it navigate current volatility and a potential economic downturn in 2023, he said. Buckley is also expecting a \"far less dramatic\" correlation between the performance of stocks and bonds, which he hopes will provide more areas for returns in the new year. While he said tilting more toward bonds helped limit losses in 2022, he expects 2023 to be a relatively more favorable environment for stocks. \"It's going to be more of a stock-picker's market, where security selection matters even more than a kind of macro orientation of a portfolio,\" he said. \"We're doubling down on focusing on companies that we think have productivity initiatives, that have been able to invest through the pandemic, that will start to reap the rewards of that investment as we go into 2023.\"", "label": "human"}
{"text": "It's one of those moments when time freezes and heart rate drops. The mother of two, Jenny Miller, shakes a 6-month old baby girl in her arms as she discovers something strange on the baby monitor in the living room while her three-year-old son is sleeping at noon. When Jenny looked closer, the baby's bed was empty. \"I almost bite, I can't believe it. My baby is gone,\" Jenny told Yahoo News. Jenny is one of many parents who have experienced this terrible phenomenon: the empty baby's bed with a baby monitor video, even if the child was already there. This type of ghost event has been documented around the world, enough to cause concern and panic for any parent. After the shock, Jenny said that she began to act. She got up and checked her daughter's room and found out that she was asleep in the baby's bed. Then she examined her son and saw him fall asleep in his own room. At first, she thought it was a technical failure, but then she knew there were other things to be responsible for. Her daughter somehow managed to move out of the camera frame, which resulted in baby monitors showing only one empty crib. \"I'm happy to find my daughter safe. I can't even imagine the panic I would feel if I couldn't find her,\" Jenny said. Many parents, especially infants and young children who are just beginning to learn how to move, have experienced this. While it can be terrifying for parents, experts say it's important to stay calm and take steps to prevent such situations from happening in the future. Dr Jason Mudd, a pediatrician from New York City, says it's normal for babies and young children to start developing their gross motor skills by leaving the crib or away from monitors. He recommends that parents use bed buffers or monitors with wider field of view to better track their movements. \"Baby monitors and other forms of surveillance can give parents peace of mind, but it's important to remember that even with the best technology, babies and young children can still move around and leave their field of vision,\" Dr. Mood said. While this type of event can be frightening, Dr. Mudd says it's important for parents to remain calm and not overreact. \"It's normal for babies and young children to start walking around and exploring their environment, so don't be too alarmed if you see your child coming out of the crib or leaving your monitor frame,\" he said. Jenny says she has learned important lessons from her experience. \"I think parents have to be aware that this could happen and take steps to make sure their children are safe,\" she said. Jenny said she is now keeping a close eye on her monitor and has taken extra security measures to ensure that her baby stays in bed. \"I'm glad my daughter is safe and I can find her,\" Jenny said, \"and it's an experience that I will never forget.\"", "label": "machine"}

The site is revered in Islam as the Noble Sanctuary, where the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven, but in Judaism it is called the Temple Mount, because it was the location of the biblical Temples.\n\nBen-Gvir, previously convicted in an Israeli court of ties to an anti-Arab racist organization, has long called for expanded access and rights for Jews on the hilltop. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended Ben-Gvir's visit, saying there would be no change to the status quo of the holy site. Arab countries and the U.S. warned that any unilateral changes to the way the religious site is run could spark violence.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates, a key ally of Israel, says it is pushing, with China's support, for the U.N. Security Council to discuss the situation. The Palestinian Foreign Ministry said it urged the UAE to request the meeting, and that it is expected to take place Thursday.\n\ntoggle caption Maya Alleruzzo/AP\n\nAn Israeli diplomatic official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal communications, tells NPR that Israel's Foreign Ministry instructed Israeli embassies to lobby countries against any moves the Security Council might take. Israeli news site Walla News first reported the Israeli efforts to block the proposed U.N. meeting.\n\nThe UAE was among the first Arab countries to criticize Ben-Gvir's visit to the compound, and held calls with Turkey and Jordan on the matter. Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey and Bahrain have all slammed the visit, with most of them calling it \"provocative.\"\n\nBut the UAE's outspoken criticism is particularly noteworthy, given its warm public embrace of Israel. The two countries, then under Netanyahu and President Donald Trump, opened diplomatic relations in 2020, and just last month, the UAE's ambassador to Israel hosted Ben-Gvir at an Emirati national day celebration.\n\nElham Fakhro, a Bahraini research fellow at the University of Exeter, says public opinion in the Gulf is largely opposed to Israeli actions against Palestinians, and is skeptical that formal ties with Arab states can change Israel's policies.\n\n\"I think what's happening now is there's been a maturing of the relationship between the two sides. I think the Emiratis are more confident in the relationship with Israel,\" says Fakhro, author of a forthcoming book on the U.S.-brokered deals that formalized ties between Israel and the Gulf Arab states of Bahrain and the UAE in 2020.\n\n\"They're trying to use their influence,\" she says of the UAE. \"Whether or not Netanyahu is going to be a willing partner in that is a different question.\"\n\nBen-Gvir's visit to the holy site also drew criticism within Israel from those opposed to the country's new ultranationalist government.\n\n\"It's outrageous. It's totally intolerable,\" former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert tells NPR. \"I completely understand the reaction of the international community.\"\n\nNPR's Aya Batrawy contributed to this story from Dubai.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Whenever there's a big storm in the American West, pilots are likely flying into the eye, seeding clouds with a substance called silver iodide. The goal is to increase precipitation. Cloud seeding has been around since the 1940s. It's become widespread of late as the West battles a drought of historic proportions. States, utility companies and even ski resorts are footing the bill. While it was was assumed for decades to be effective, recent studies have helped prove that cloud seeding works, and there's no evidence that silver iodide is harmful at current levels. Experts say cloud seeding generally yields a 5% to 15% increase in precipitation. It's no cure for drought, but cloud seeding can be an important water management tool. \"We can't make a storm happen and we can't create conditions in this storm that are ideal. Those happen naturally,\" said Jason Carkeet, a utility analyst and hydrologist with the Turlock Irrigation District in central California. Turlock started its cloud-seeding program in 1990. \"What we're doing is just taking advantage of existing conditions, naturally occurring conditions, and trying to make the storm again more efficient from a water supply perspective,\" Carkeet said.\n\nHow cloud seeding works\n\nWhen done aerially, cloud seeding involves loading up a plane with silver iodide. Flares are placed on the wings and fuselage. The pilot reaches a certain altitude, where temperatures are ideal, and shoots the flares into the cloud. The silver iodide causes individual water droplets within the clouds to freeze together, forming snowflakes that eventually become so heavy that they fall. Absent the freezing process, the droplets wouldn't bond together and become large enough to precipitate as either rain or snow. \"The cloud initially is all water,\" said Bruce Boe, vice president of meteorology at Weather Modification International, a private company that's been providing cloud-seeding services since 1961. \"Eventually, as it gets toward the summit of the mountain, it may be 50% ice or maybe more than that. But even if it is, there's still a lot of liquid water left there.\" Boe said there's a \"window of opportunity\" to get the precipitation big enough to fall \"before it crests the mountain and starts to descend and thus warm.\"\n\nPilot Joel Zimmer, who works for Weather Modification International, affixes silver iodide flares to the bottom of a cloud seeding plane. Katie Brigham | CNBC\n\nFor cloud-seeding pilots like Joel Zimmer, who works with Weather Modification International to seed clouds for the Turlock Irrigation District, flying into the storm can be an exhilarating but intense experience. \"By the time the wheels are up, you're in cloud,\" said Zimmer, whose route involves seeding over the Sierra Nevada mountains. \"And we're in cloud the entire mission until we're shooting an approach back into an airport and then pop out of the clouds and have a visual on the runway. It feels like you're a sub commander in the Navy. You don't see anything.\" From a water supply perspective, it's most valuable to seed clouds over mountains, where the water is essentially stored as snow until the spring runoff. \"When it's out on the plains such as North Dakota, it's still a benefit because it helps recharge soil moisture,\" Boe said. \"But it can't be stored and used for a later date.\" While Texas uses cloud seeding to help irrigate fields for farmers, it's more common in the West, where states like Idaho, California, Colorado, Utah and Wyoming use it to help fill up their rivers and reservoirs. Most programs use planes for cloud seeding, but some use ground-based flares. \"It's a lot more common than people think,\" Carkeet said. \"More basins have a seeding program than do not have a seeding program.\"\n\nCosts and impact", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Happy 50th Anniversary to the discovery of the Santa Claus rally. It's that time of year again: the Santa Claus rally. Like a lot of Wall Street mythology, this one has a lot of barnacles around it. Santa Claus rally: what it is The Santa Claus rally is a short rally that runs from the last five trading days of the year to the first two trading days of the New Year. Across that span, the S & P 500 posts an average gain of 1.3% since 1950. A 1.3% increase over seven days is much higher than the expected probability that the S & P 500 would increase by that amount over a seven-day trading period, so this is statistically significant. And it happens fairly often. According to one study, a Santa Claus rally has materialized in four out of every five years since 1950. Santa Claus rally: what it isn't Still, this is often taken as some kind of trading strategy. \"It's not a trading strategy, it's an indicator!,\" Jeff Hirsch reminded readers of the Trader's Almanac a few weeks ago. Jeff's point: failure to rally in these coming seven days tends to precede bear markets or times when stocks could be purchased later in the year at lower prices. He should know. His father, Yale Hirsch, a friend of mine for many years, discovered and named the Santa Claus rally in 1972. This year is the 50th anniversary! It's also why the rally is so closely associated with Yale's now-famous couplet: \"If Santa Claus Should Fail To Call, Bears May Come To Broad And Wall,\" (referring to the New York Stock Exchange location). Why is there a Santa Claus rally at all? Nobody knows, but there is no shortage of explanations: anticipation of new money coming into the market in January, optimism about the new year, end of year bonuses being put to work, lack of institutional trading which leaves the market to more optimistic retail traders, and even just traders anticipating a rally. All of this makes some sense, but it makes a simple assumption: that everything is relatively normal and there is no macroeconomic event that has everyone worried. That's not the case right now. Markets are obsessed with a recession in 2023. But here's an odd thing: Santa Claus rallies do occur during recessions. \"The three largest Santa Claus rallies (2008-2009, 1974-1975 and 1973-1974) occurred during recessions, as did the worst end-of-year periods (1990-1991 and 2007-2008),\" one study concluded ( https://smartasset.com/investing/santa-claus-rally-2020 ).

The reports come amid growing speculation that the former KGB agent may have cancer and his health is deteriorating. Mr. Putin, 67, has not publicly revealed his state of health, but speculation in the media and political circles has been rampant that the leader may have cancer or a serious illness. Now, Danish intelligence sources claim that the leader was undergoing cancer treatment when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2014. According to sources, Putin received chemotherapy in late 2013 and early 2014. The Danish newspaper Politiken first reported the news, saying that the treatment took place in a hospital in St. Petersburg. It said the treatment left Putin suffering from chronic pain, which he reportedly continues to suffer. The reports have sparked speculation about Putin's health, which some experts believe may be worsening. In the past, Putin denied reports about his health, telling reporters in 2018 that he was in good health and had no potential health problems. But the latest reports suggest that Putin may have suffered from serious health problems at the time of Ukraine's invasion. The reports also sparked speculation that the Kremlin may have hidden information about the leader's health. In April 2014, after Russia's seizure of Crimea and the conflict in eastern Ukraine began, Putin appeared increasingly out of public view. He also cancelled his planned trip to Sochi, leading to speculation that he was seriously ill. At the time, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the reports as \"nonsense,\" saying Putin was in good health and that he had canceled the trip simply because of the situation in Ukraine. However, reports of Putin's treatment of cancer have raised questions about why the Kremlin chose to deny a report on his condition at the time. Russia's 2014 invasion of Ukraine is widely seen as an attempt to reaffirm Moscow's influence on its former Soviet neighbors. Since then, tensions between the two countries have been at their highest level since the Cold War, with many clashes taking place along the common border of the two countries and in the annexed region of Crimea. Russia's actions in Ukraine have drawn international condemnation and led to a series of economic and diplomatic sanctions. The latest reports on Putin's health further raise questions about the president's adaptability to governance and his motives for launching a conflict in Ukraine. It is unclear whether the Russian leader used medical treatment as a pretext for launching the invasion, or whether he was too ill-healthed to lead the country at the time. It's clear that Putin's health is increasingly important to the leader's political future, and any further reports of serious illness could have a severe impact on Russia.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "As the end of the year draws near, Americans are starting to think about their taxes, and many will consider making charitable donations for 2020. There are many benefits to charity - it can help those in need, it can reduce your taxable income, and even maximize savings on taxes. After COVID-19 and its devastating economic impact, giving to charity is more important than ever. According to the Giving USA 2020 report, U.S. donations to charity fell by 3.9% in 2020. For those considering making a charitable donation this year, there are two \"best\" ways to minimize your tax break. The first way is to donate money. Cash donations are the most effective way to donate to charity and also the most effective tax rate. You can deduct up to 60% of your adjusted total income as a cash donation and withdraw it in the tax year you pay for the donation. When you donate a high-value stock, you can not only deduct the full market value of that stock, but also be exempt from capital gains tax on appreciation. This means that you can deduct the full market value of this stock without paying any taxes. These are the two best ways to maximize tax relief. In addition, you can use other methods of donating to charity, such as donating property, donating IRA assets or setting up a donor advisory fund. It's important to talk with a financial advisor or a tax professional to determine which method is best for your personal situation. When donating to a charity, it is important to keep details of the deductions and all receipts and other documents related to the donation. Also, make sure that you donate to a legitimate charity - especially if you are considering contributing to a relief organization or crowdfunding site. You should always conduct research to ensure that the organization or individual is legal and that your donation will be used for the purpose you wish. Donations to charities are a great way to reduce taxable income and help those in need. As the year draws to a close, everyone is considering paying taxes, please consider making charitable donations to maximize tax relief. With the right approach, you can donate to charities, reduce taxable income, and help those in need.", "label": "machine"}

Col. Matthew Shelly, an experienced A-10 pilot and the commander of the 74th Fighter Squadron, told Insider. It's only the 74th and 75th Fighter Squadrons of the 23rd Fighter Group and the 76th Fighter Squadron, once part of the 23rd but now part of a Reserve unit, at Moody Air Force Base that fly with shark's teeth.\n\n\"There are other A-10 units that have nose art, but not the iconic shark face,\" he said.\n\nFor instance, the Air Force Reserve's 442nd Fighter Wing at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri gave their A-10s Warthog teeth with tusks in 2015 after an aircraft structural maintenance technician asked, \"Why don't ours have teeth?\"\n\nAircraft 79-123 was the first A-10 Thunderbolt II flying out of the 442nd Fighter Wing at Whiteman Air Force Base, Mo., to receive teeth.

Bulow-Gonterman\n\nP-40s and Flying Tigers\n\nFor many of World War II's combatants, the conflict was something of a golden age for military aircraft art. The designs ranged from teeth to pin-up models to cartoon characters.\n\nThe intake on the Curtiss P-40, an Allied fighter and ground-attack aircraft, lent itself to a shark mouth design.\n\nThe first P-40s to feature the shark mouth war paint were the British Royal Air Force Tomahawks. The design was later adopted by the Americans and featured on US P-40s, which were known as Warhawks.\n\nFor the Americans, the shark art \"started in the American Volunteer Group, which eventually became the 23rd Fighter Group,\" Shelly said.\n\nA P-40 Warhawk painted in the colors of the American Volunteer Group (Flying Tigers) at a 2018 air show. US Air Force photo by Master Sgt. Mark C. Olsen\n\nThe American Volunteer Group, which was commanded by Claire Chennault, is more famously known as the \"Flying Tigers.\"\n\nThe group, which defended China against the Japanese, was activated prior to America's entry into World War II and saw combat shortly after the US declared war on Japan.\n\nThe group was organized into the Chinese air force and flew under the flag of the Republic of China. It was only active for about a year before it was disbanded, but in that time, it destroyed 297 enemy aircraft, according to the US Air Force.\n\nTheir actions made them legends. \"They did that with P-40 aircraft,\" Shelly said. And, \"when you look at the P-40 aircraft from World War II, almost all the pictures that you look at have a shark face on it,\" he added.\n\nA P-40 Warhawk painted in the colors of the American Volunteer Group (Flying Tigers) at a 2018 air show. US Air Force photo by Master Sgt. Mark C. Olsen\n\nAfter the American Volunteer Group was disbanded in summer 1942, the 23rd Fighter Group, which was established as the 23rd Pursuit Group (Interceptor) of the US Army Air Forces, took in some officers, pilots, and maintainers from the group and took over its nickname and its mission in the China-Burma-India area of operations.\n\nThe 23rd Fighter Group consisted of the 74th, 75th, and 76th Fighter Squadrons and was a component of the China Air Task Force overseen by Chennault and later the Fourteenth Air Force.\n\nThose \"squadrons are now here at Moody,\" Shelly explained. \"We all trace our lineage back to the American Volunteer Group in World War II that had shark teeth on their airplanes.\"\n\nThe 74th and 75th Fighter Squadrons are still part of the 23rd Fighter Group while the 76th is now a Reserve unit with 476th Fighter Group.

{"text": ".. People across the U.S. were frightened on Wednesday as a ticket announced to be purchased in Michigan won a huge prize of $785 million Tuesday, the sixth largest in U.S. history. The winning number was 4-26-42-50-60, of which Miga Ball was 24.The Michigan Lottery confirmed the winner bought their tickets in Novi Town, Michigan, about 30 miles from Detroit. It is not clear whether the winners will be individuals, groups or organizations.The Michigan Lottery Company said it was waiting for news of the winner before making any further announcements. The total prize pool of $785 million is the sixth prize pool in U.S. history and the second largest in Super Million Lottery history. The largest was a payment of $1,537 million on October 23, 2018, shared by winners from South Carolina, New York and Texas. The $785 million payment is also the highest total since January 2016, when the US Powerball Lottery reached a record $1.586 billion in payments. The victory comes at a time when American families are increasingly in need of money, as the coronavirus epidemic forces millions to lose their jobs and creates huge economic hardships in many parts of the country. The winners of the Super Million Award will receive a one-time bonus of $478 million, or they can choose to receive the prize in their annuities and issue it annually for 29 years. In January 2019, a lucky winner in Florida brought home a huge $450 million bonus. In 2018, one Wisconsin winner claimed to have won a Powerball trophy of $768.4 million. In this case, the winner chose to remain anonymous and only identify himself as \"24\", which is in line with the age at which he won the game. The top prize has been climbing since June 2, when it was only $40 million. But there are no winners until now, and even with 21 consecutive draws, nobody can match all the numbers. Since 1996, the chances of a millionaire winning have been one in 302.5 billion. Given this, it is estimated that a person will be more likely to be struck by lightning than to win a millionaire during their lifetime. But for people in Novi, Michigan and surrounding communities, the opportunity is good for them. The person or group responsible for buying winning tickets will soon be added to the world's newest list of millionaires. Winning the race is not only a blessing for the winners, it's also a comfort to many in Michigan. According to Michigan Lottery, the state will receive nearly $8.5 million in tax revenue from this money that will go toward its education programs. Currently, Michigan Lottery encourages winners to sign the back of a ticket and keep it in a safe place until they decide how to apply for their bonus. Lucky ticket holders propose and request bonuses for one year from the draw date. This is an exciting moment not only for the people of Michigan, but also for the nation as a whole. It's another reminder of the power of lottery and how it can change lives in no time. For the lucky winners, it's time to take the first step towards a new life filled with unimaginable wealth and bright future.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "As the 17th week of the NFL season draws to a close, conversation begins to turn to the playoffs. For some teams, this week's game will have a major impact on their chances in the playoffs. One of the teams that has been eliminated is the Houston Texans, who have already been eliminated from the playoffs. But while Texas are expected to struggle this season with injuries and poor roster building, it's widely expected that one team - the San Antonio Commandos - will go deep into the playoffs. With quarterback Carson Wentz, the commanders have high expectations for going into the season. Wentz, who served as Super Bowl MVP, is expected to be at the heart of a powerful offensive that could take the commander to the Super Bowl. Winz has been plagued by turnover and poor decision-making, leading the captain to score close to the bottom of the league in each game. Despite a talented lineup, commanders have struggled to achieve any form of consistency that eventually missed the playoffs. Most disappointing was Wentz, who many hoped he would put the team on his back and lead them to the promised land. While he wasn't as bad as some thought, it remained a major setback for commanders organizations. The team still has a wealth of talent, including capable offensive lines and young defenders who are still struggling to find a foothold. If the commander can find ways to address their offensive flaws and bring Wentz back to his MVP level, then they should continue to be involved next season. That said, if commanders want to compete for the title, they have to make a lot of improvements. While it may be tempting to look back and wonder what will happen this season, teams are better off looking ahead and figuring out how to make the necessary improvements. If commanders are able to make the right move, they may still be one of the NFL winners this season. While no one is shocked that Carson Wentz and Commander have failed to reach the playoffs this season, the future remains hopeful.", "label": "machine"}

It also agreed to hear oral arguments in February and rule on whether the states can intervene, with a decision due by the end of June. The policy will remain in place at least until that ruling is issued.\n\n\"Title 42 is a public health measure, not an immigration enforcement measure, and it should not be extended indefinitely,\" the White House said in a statement. \"To truly fix our broken immigration system, we need Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform measures like the ones President Biden proposed on his first day in office.\"\n\nConservative Justice Neil Gorsuch joined the three liberals on the court in voting against the stay request. The brief court order said that while the administration cannot set aside the Title 42 policy, the decision \"does not prevent the federal government from taking any action with respect to that policy.\"\n\nMore than 2 million people have been deported at the southern border under the policy since 2020.\n\nIn November, a federal district court in Washington, D.C., had ordered the Department of Homeland Security to end the policy Dec. 21, criticizing the deportations as arbitrary. But Republican-led states intervened in the case and successfully petitioned the high court to block that lower court ruling. Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily blocked the Biden administration earlier this month from ending the controversial policy.\n\nThe deportation policy originated with the Trump administration. In March 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention used a provision under the Public Health Services Act, or Title 42, to prohibit migrants from crossing into the U.S. from Mexico or Canada due to the risk of them spreading Covid-19. The deportation policy is often referred to simply as Title 42.\n\nBut human rights groups and dozens of health experts fiercely criticized the policy as a way for the federal government to carry out arbitrary mass deportations at the southern border under the guise of public health.\n\nThe White House continued the policy until April 2022, when the CDC said it was longer necessary to prevent the spread of Covid.

Dat heeft topman Andy Jassy aan de medewerkers laten weten.\n\nHet gaat om de grootste banenreductie in de geschiedenis van Amazon en is een nieuw signaal dat grote techbedrijven een omslag doormaken. In de sector zijn de laatste maanden al verschillende grote ontslagrondes aangekondigd.\n\nAmazon had in november al aangegeven dat er personeel ontslagen zou worden, waarbij de topman aangaf er aan het begin van het nieuwe jaar meer over te kunnen zeggen. Amerikaanse media meldden destijds dat het in Seattle gevestigde bedrijf zo\u2019n 10.000 banen zou gaan schrappen.\n\nDe ontslagronde is volgens Jassy noodzakelijk vanwege \u201cde onzekere economie\u201d en omdat het webwinkelconcern \u201csnel personeel had aangenomen\u201d tijdens de pandemie. Consumenten bestelden tijdens de coronapandemie massaal producten bij de webwinkel. Om aan die explosieve vraag naar leveringen te voldoen verdubbelde het wereldwijde personeelsbestand van Amazon tussen 2020 en 2022. Maar nu verwacht Amazon dus mindere tijden door de gedaalde koopkracht en mogelijke economische recessie.\n\nEen deel van de ontslagen bij Amazon zal in Europa zijn, zei Jassy, eraan toevoegend dat de getroffen werknemers vanaf 18 januari op de hoogte zullen worden gebracht. Vooral de verkooptak van Amazon en de afdeling die zich bezighoudt met de werving van nieuwe medewerkers lijken te worden getroffen.\n\nJassy zei verder dat de plotselinge aankondiging van de ontslagronde werd gedaan \"omdat een van onze teamgenoten deze informatie extern heeft gelekt\".\n\nFNV verwacht weinig impact in Nederland\n\nHet wereldwijde massaontslag bij webwinkelconcern Amazon gaat waarschijnlijk grotendeels aan Nederland voorbij, denkt vakbond FNV. Volgens FNV-bestuurder Michiel Al heeft het Amerikaanse bedrijf in Nederland maar \u00e9\u00e9n bezorgcentrum, in de buurt van Schiphol. Daar verwacht hij eigenlijk geen ontslagen zolang er in Nederland mensen zijn die artikelen blijven bestellen.\n\nAl schat dat er op het Nederlandse bezorgcentrum, een verdeelpunt voor pakketjes die uit andere distributiecentra van Amazon in Europa komen, zo'n 150 tot 200 mensen werken. Dat zijn volgens hem veelal uitzendkrachten. Verder is er voor zover de vakbondsman weet ook nog wat kantoorpersoneel aan de slag in Nederland. Hij schat dat dit gaat om tientallen mensen, maar met hen heeft FNV geen contact.\n\nDe aanwezigheid van de bond is sowieso erg beperkt bij Amazon, dat erom bekend staat vakbonden zoveel mogelijk buiten de deur te willen houden.\n\nAmazon startte pas tijdens de coronapandemie met een Nederlandse versie van zijn webwinkel. Het bezorgcentrum werd in de zomer van 2021 geopend. FNV heeft toen aangegeven ook met de leiding van het bedrijf te willen gaan praten. \"Maar ik wacht al anderhalf jaar op een uitnodiging\", zegt Al.\n\nDe FNV'er denkt dat de ingreep van Amazon in Europa vooral in Duitsland gevoeld zal worden. Dat is volgens hem de grootste Europese markt van het bedrijf. Ook sluit hij een relatief groot banenverlies in Luxemburg niet uit. \"Als het om kantoorfuncties gaat dan kan het dat Luxemburg wordt getroffen, want daar zit het Europese hoofdkantoor van Amazon.\"\n\nTechsector snijdt in het personeelsbestand\n\nDe veranderde economische situatie zorgde al eerder voor ontslagen bij technologiebedrijven. Zo zette Elon Musk recent flink het mes in het personeelsbestand van Twitter. Ook Meta, het moederbedrijf van Facebook, kondigde vorig jaar een reorganisatie aan. Daarbij verdwijnen er 11.000 banen, ongeveer 13 procent van het totale aantal arbeidskrachten. Eerder deze week werd bekend dat fabrikant van bedrijfssoftware Salesforce zijn 80.000 werknemers tellende personeelsbestand met ongeveer 10 procent wil verminderen doordat klanten voorzichtiger zijn geworden met hun uitgaven.\n\nDe ontslagronde van Amazon is wel grootste van de recente personeelsinkrimpingen in de Amerikaanse technologiesector. Maar Amazon heeft ook met afstand het meeste personeel. Het concern had eind september wereldwijd meer dan 1,5 miljoen werknemers in dienst. Dat is exclusief seizoenarbeiders die worden geworven tijdens periodes van verhoogde activiteit, met name tijdens de feestdagenperiode.", "label": "human"}
{"text": ".. Mexican authorities arrested the son of notorious drug lord Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman on Wednesday, just hours before President-elect Joe Biden is expected to visit the country. According to Mexico's security minister, Alfonso Durazo, 28-year-old Ovidio Guzman Lopez was arrested by Mexican security forces in Western Sinaloa. Authorities said his arrest warrant was linked to allegations of organized crime. Lopez's arrest came amid tensions between the United States and Mexico after the outgoing Trump administration imposed tariffs on billions of dollars of Mexican goods last week. The arrest appears to be a move by the Mexican government to bolster security ahead of Biden's visit and that of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, just days after President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office. Biden and Harris are expected to focus on economic and security issues during their visit. The U.S. and Mexico share a long, complicated border and want to tackle cross-border drug trafficking and illegal immigration. Lopez is one of Mexico's most notorious drug traffickers, the son of Guzman, one of the country's most notorious drug lords, who led the Sinaloa cartel and was arrested in 2016 after two escapes from Mexican prisons. Guzman was sentenced to life in prison after being convicted of drug trafficking and murder in the United States. In October 2019, U.S. authorities tried to extradite Lopez from Mexico for drug trafficking offenses, and in October 2019 it was reported that he had been involved in a confrontation between Mexican and U.S. authorities for some time. However, Mexico's extradition court rejected the request on the grounds of an alleged \"lack of accuracy\". On Wednesday, Mexican troops entered the capital of Sinaloa, Culiacan, along with police, and local gangs were reported to be mobilizing in support of Lopez. While details of the attack are unclear, Mexican media reported that some followers of Lopez fired shots in the city to disturb the operation. Durazo said the shooting between security forces and Lopez's followers was \"unjustified\", adding that some members of the security forces were injured. Mexico has long fought drug cartels, which have surged in recent years as the country struggles to curb violence and corruption. The fight against organized crime has been one of President-elect Lopez Obrador's top priorities since taking office in December 2018. The government said the arrest of drug lords, including Lopez, was part of its overall strategy to tackle drug-related violence, which has risen in Mexico. This effort has had some success, but the country has yet to weaken the capacity of drug cartels. Biden and Harris are expected to discuss cross-border security issues, as well as trade and economic issues with their Mexican counterparts during the visit. While the two leaders are expected to take a more cooperative approach on issues such as immigration and drug trafficking, the Biden administration's policy toward Mexico may be different from that of the Trump administration. Biden has promised to shift the focus of U.S. foreign policy away from Trump's \"America First\" approach and prioritise diplomacy, multilateralism and human rights.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "The shares of Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. fell nearly 50 percent after the troubled retailer said it was exploring its options, including filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The troubled home goods retailer has struggled for years, even before the pandemic, as it failed to keep pace with changing consumer preferences and the rise of online competition. The company said it had worked with Evercore and Lazard to explore strategies and financial options for increasing liquidity and improving its financial position. These options include restructuring debt, modifying existing debt obligations, disposing of assets, raising additional funds, and possibly filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Bed Bath & Beyond said it had reached a tolerance agreement with certain lenders, involving its previously announced plans to borrow up to $250 million under its asset-based lending facility. The agreement will give the company more time to explore its options, although Bed Bath & Beyond said it has not yet decided to pursue any of these options. The news put the stock in trouble, dropping more than 45 percent to $7.64 per share on an hour-after trade. According to Bloomberg, the company's co-store sales have been falling every quarter since 2017. According to Moody's Investor Service, it has also been dragged by huge debt and will have $1.26 billion due in 2020. It was also hit hard by the outbreak, which forced the company to close all stores across the country and lay off employees in March. While the company was able to reopen most of its stores this summer, it hasn't fully recovered and its sales are still lower than last year. Bed Bath & Beyond has been trying to turn things around for years, but the epidemic exacerbates its problems. It has been cutting costs and narrowing the footprint of its stores, but these measures may not be enough to save the company in the long run. The company now faces the possibility of filing for bankruptcy, which will enable it to cancel its debt and restructure its business. This is a risky move, however, as it could mean closing more stores, renegotiation of lease contracts and potentially eliminating investors. It remains to be seen, but for this iconic retailer it is undoubtedly a disturbing sign.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "As investors position their portfolios for the year ahead, one sector is a standout pick for the investment panel on CNBC's \"Halftime Report\" : financials. Financials are well-positioned to deal with volatility after preparing for a bearish scenario in 2023, according to the investment committee on Wednesday. The panel included Joe Terranova, Karen Firestone, Jenny Harrington and Jim Lebenthal. \"In every recession, there's one sector, whose balance sheet is most negatively affected by the recession. So if you go back to 2000, 2001, it was technology. Well, what happens? That sector cleans up its balance sheet. and the next recession, they're able to endure through that environment,\" said Terranova, senior managing director at Virtus Investment Partners. \"In '08, technology, best sector. So, if you think about '08, financials' most negatively impacted, cleaned up the balance sheets, I think they're gonna be resilient and recessionary environment,\" Terranova added. Gilman Hill Asset Management CEO Jenny Harrington named financial stocks as her top 2023 sector pick, saying the sector is undervalued after reviewing its price/earnings to growth ratio, or PEG ratio. Financials had the second-lowest PEG ratio among the S & P sectors, after consumer discretionary stocks. What's more, banks may have bolstered their reserves for a truly bearish scenario. \"If my friend [Jim Lebenthal] is right, and we have no recession or not a terrible recession, banks should end up doing really well next year,\" Harrington said. The financials sector in the S & P 500 was down by 12% in 2022, still outperforming the broader market index despite the drop. Similarly, Aureus Asset Management Chairman and CEO Karen Firestone chose financials as her top sector in 2023, though she specified she prefers companies apart from the big banks in the sector. Firestone named S & P Global , Charles Schwab , First Republic Bank and Blackstone as stocks that she owns, all of which are down severely after the past year. Shares of S & P Global lost 29% in 2022, while First Republic Bank plunged nearly 41%. Meanwhile, Blackstone dropped more than 42% last year. Regardless, the investor expects these stocks are more attractive in the coming year, given their higher cash flow and dividend yields. Notably, Firestone called Charles Schwab one of her top 2023 stock picks, saying the business has a lot of momentum for asset growth, and will be supported by higher interest rates. According to Firestone, \"It's an organic growth story, and we think that this multiple can sustain itself.\" The other investment panel members approved of the picks. \"I don't think we're going to have a recession,\" Cerity Partners' Lebenthal said. \"The balance sheets are in great shape, which means their lending is going to continue, and if you don't have a recession, then all that capital expenditure that you've heard me talk about for months comes to fruition.\" \"That needs financing, okay, and that financing is going to come from the banks, whether it's in loans or underwriting debt. Economic activity benefits the financials,\" Lebenthal added. Here is the full 2023 stock picks from the group: Karen Firestone: Charles Schwab, Align Technology, American Tower; Sector Pick: Financials Jenny Harrington: Kohl's, Uber, B & G Foods; Sector Pick: Financials Jim Lebenthal: Boeing, Cleveland-Cliffs, Paramount Global; Sector Pick: Industrials", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Ahead of the Jan. 10 release of his debut memoir Spare, Prince Harry has been opening up about how he\u2019s grown apart from his father, King Charles III, and his brother William, the Prince of Wales and heir to the throne.\n\nThe tensions in the family boiled over in public when, in January 2020, Harry announced that he was taking a step back from his royal duties because of what he saw as a lack of support from the palace staff over racist tabloid coverage of his wife, the American actor Meghan Markle.\n\nIn a copy of Spare obtained by the Guardian, he described Prince William pushing him to the ground, resulting in scrapes and bruises on his back, during a fight about Markle, whom William allegedly called \u201cabrasive.\u201d Harry also says in the book that he begged Charles not to marry Camilla, who is now the Queen Consort, and recalls that when his mother Princess Diana died 25 years ago, his father was standoffish and didn\u2019t hug him. Leaked passages from Spare suggest tensions go back to birth\u2014an underlying resentment of being \u201cthe spare heir\u201d, while his brother is next in line to the throne.\n\nAlexander Larman, author of The Crown in Crisis: Countdown to the Abdication and The Windsors at War: The King, His Brother and a Family Divided, argues that the two brothers tended to butt heads even before Harry left for America, stating, \u201cBoth of them are strong personalities, committed to a variety of causes and initiatives, and inevitably there have been clashes and disagreements along the way.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also a long history of such feuds. As Larman puts it, \u201cThink of James II, who began as Duke of York and then made a spectacular mess of being king [in the 1680s] after [his brother] Charles II died. Or Richard III, who, if Shakespeare is to be believed, brought about the deaths of both his brothers Edward IV and the Duke of Clarence to ascend the throne [in the 1480s], only to be forced off it by Henry VII. Nobody\u2019s thinking that Harry has had anything quite so dramatic in mind\u2026 yet, anyway.\u201d\n\nIn a new 60 Minutes interview airing in full on Jan. 8, Harry claims that one of the reasons he\u2019s going public about the drama is because the royal family\u2019s relationship to the British press has made it impossible for him to have the private conversations necessary to mend his relationship with his father and his brother.\n\n\u201cEvery single time I\u2019ve tried to do it privately, there have been briefings and leakings and planting of stories against me and my wife,\u201d Harry tells Anderson Cooper.\n\nIn a separate interview on U.K. broadcaster iTV, which airs a few hours before 60 Minutes, Harry argues that his father and his brother do not want to make amends. \u201cI would like to get my father back, I would like to have my brother back,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve shown absolutely no willingness to reconcile.\u201d\n\nIn a six-part Netflix docu-series Harry & Meghan that debuted in December, Harry revealed that William screamed at him during a family meeting with his father and his grandmother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, shortly after Harry announced his desire to give up royal duties. Harry also claimed that he didn\u2019t consent to a joint statement that the royal family put out in the brothers\u2019 name to debunk rumors that William was bullying Harry. He claimed that the royal family\u2019s staffers were willing to \u201clie to protect my brother\u201d and his alleged misdeeds, but \u201cfor three years they were never willing to tell the truth to protect us,\u201d meaning Meghan and himself.\n\nThe feud between the brothers is also about more than just their relationship with one another.\n\n\u201cThe traditional ascription to the ill-will between William and Harry is that neither of their wives like one another and that has driven a wedge between them, coupled with a sense on William\u2019s part that his younger brother has behaved irresponsibly and selfishly in abandoning any sense of duty by staging his quasi-abdication,\u201d says Larman.\n\nHarry has not been totally cut off from his father and brother. Shortly after Oprah Winfrey interviewed Harry and Markle in March 2021, journalist Gayle King\u2014a friend of Winfrey and Markle\u2014told People that Harry talked to his father and brother after the interview, but that the conversation was \u201cnot productive.\u201d Harry had told Oprah that his father stopped taking his calls at one point.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the family will come together in a public show of unity before King Charles III\u2019s coronation ceremony on May 6. Larman notes that Harry has chosen to air his family\u2019s dirty laundry, arguing, \u201cToday, we might not see royal brothers meeting on the field of battle, winner taking all, but instead we find them conducting their warfare via that rather more insidious weapon\u2014the media\u2014and hoping that the court of public opinion will favor one side over the other in a hopefully definitive way.\u201d\n\nWrite to Olivia B.

{"text": "A sign at the Nahant Thicket Wildlife Sanctuary warns people about coyotes, in Nahant, Mass., Dec. 28, 2022. (Sophie Park/The New York Times)\n\nNAHANT, Mass. \u2014 When coyotes approach children playing in the park, as they do with unnerving frequency in this tiny coastal town north of Boston, Kellie Frary springs into action, trying to drive the animals off while another adult quickly gathers Frary\u2019s day care group.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to have to make that phone call, to tell a parent, \u2018The coyote picked your kid,\u2019\u201d said Frary, a lifelong resident of Nahant, where 3,000 people inhabit 1 square mile.\n\nNo humans have been harmed by Nahant\u2019s coyotes, estimated to number about a dozen. But after the disappearances of more than two dozen pets in roughly two years \u2014 and reports of three brazen, fatal attacks in 2022 on leashed dogs accompanied by their owners \u2014 the town is ever more on edge. Its isolated geography \u2014 Nahant is essentially an island connected to the mainland by a narrow, 1.5-mile causeway \u2014 contributes to the sense of menace felt by some residents.\n\nSign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times\n\nCompact, densely populated and surrounded by water, it is a hard place for coyotes to leave, and a hard place for them to remain mostly invisible to humans, as they often do in cities and more sprawling suburbs, wildlife experts said.\n\nEarly in December, Nahant\u2019s three-member Board of Selectmen voted to enlist federal sharpshooters to track and kill some of the coyotes, making Nahant the first municipality in Massachusetts to seek the expert help through a new state partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nThe plan has relieved many anxious residents, some of whom now carry whistles and baseball bats on strolls around town, and dress their dogs in $100 \u201ccoyote jackets\u201d covered with metal spikes to repel attacks.\n\n\u201cI love animals, and I don\u2019t want to see them killed, but some child on a porch is going to get taken,\u201d said Lisa Wrenn, who watched a coyote snatch her 12-pound Chihuahua, Penelope, off a leash last summer as she stood on her front stairs. Left holding the leash and empty collar, she never saw the dog again, she said.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough coyotes regard small pets as prey, attacks on people are rare and almost never fatal, according to coyote experts.\n\nSupport for the sharpshooting plan is not unanimous. Opponents have argued for a more humane approach, hoisting handmade \u201cSave the Nahant Coyotes\u201d signs near the causeway into town.\n\nFrancene Amari-Faulkner, a resident who has organized protests against the plan, said false claims and exaggeration have fueled hysteria and a rush to drastic measures. \u201cIf the town brings in sharpshooters, it\u2019s going to be a bloodbath,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause then other towns will say, \u2018We can do that too.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlthough a coyote problem on a peninsula jutting into the sea may be less than typical, human aversion to the species is well established. Coyotes have long been viewed as a nuisance, and millions have been poisoned, shot and trapped by frustrated or frightened humans trying to control their population. But their signature trait may be their persistence. By the 1950s, they had pushed east into Massachusetts; by 2000, they were present everywhere in the state except the islands of Nantucket and Martha\u2019s Vineyard, according to the state Division of Fisheries and Wildlife.\n\nTony Barletta, Nahant\u2019s town administrator, takes pains to remind residents that there is no going back: Coyotes will remain, long after a handful are eliminated. And like it or not, residents will have to find a way to live alongside them.\n\n\u201cWe fully expect to have them here in town,\u201d Barletta said at a recent meeting of the Board of Selectmen. \u201cJust because you\u2019re afraid of coyotes doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a problem, and that\u2019s a tough thing to explain to residents.\u201d\n\nMassachusetts offers fewer checks on the coyote population than many other places, with its abbreviated hunting season, local rules against discharging firearms and ban on most effective traps, enacted by a ballot referendum in 1996.\n\nIn South Carolina, 25,000 to 30,000 coyotes are killed by hunting and trapping every year, while in Massachusetts, the annual total is around 500, said Dave Wattles, a biologist with the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife. Yet even in the South, he said, hunting has little impact on coyote numbers, known for rebounding rapidly from any dips.\n\nAs local encounters with the animals have multiplied \u2014 residents share videos of coyotes patrolling their porches on a Facebook page called \u201cNahant Coyote Victims\u201d \u2014 theories have multiplied. Some locals believe the omnivorous creatures have wiped out all the island\u2019s resident skunks and raccoons (rabbits have somehow persisted), and are hungrily stalking homes with pets, looking for food.\n\nState and local authorities stress that attacks on off-leash pets are normal coyote behavior, unfortunate but not concerning. But in targeting dogs on leashes, coyotes in Nahant have deviated from normal patterns, indicating decreased fear of humans, Wattles said. Those attacks prompted the state to authorize the town to seek federal intervention to kill some animals.\n\nBecause there is no way for sharpshooters to identify the most aggressive, they will probably use trial and error, killing several and then waiting to see if atypical behaviors subside.\n\nExperts say it will fall to the people of Nahant to reinstill a healthy fear of humans in the remaining coyotes \u2014 and that will require overcoming their own fear.\n\n\u201cIf humans act submissive toward them, and run away, it teaches them they\u2019re the king of Nahant,\u201d Wattles said during an educational meeting hosted by the town for residents in July. \u201cYou have to teach them you\u2019re a threat, and they\u2019re not welcome.\u201d\n\nBy engaging in ongoing harassment known as \u201chazing,\u201d he said \u2014 chasing coyotes; spraying them with water; throwing sand or gravel at them; screaming and banging pots and pans to disrupt them \u2014 residents can reestablish boundaries.\n\nBut after seeing little impact from attempts at hazing, some residents worry it may be too late.\n\nMichael Hanlon, a part-time resident of the town, said he \u201cyelled bloody murder\u201d and swung a 3-foot stick at three coyotes who circled him and his dog Dewey on a residential street one recent night, but the animals only retreated a few feet.\n\nHanlon retreated into his house.\n\n\u201cThey have no fear at all,\u201d said Frary, the day care provider, whose 12-year-old Pekingese poodle, Brody, reluctantly dons a spiked vest on walks. \u201cIt\u2019s like a teacher who was lenient, and then tries to be strict. \u2026 They\u2019re used to us now, and it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nShe said coyotes have been known to laze in the sun on the local golf course, watching players putt. Linda Tanfani, another resident, complained to town officials after loitering coyotes cast a pall over her game of pickleball.\n\n\u201cWhen they\u2019re ruling over us, controlling our lives, it\u2019s not right,\u201d Tanfani said at the select board meeting. \u201cI\u2019m tense all the time.\u201d\n\nWildlife experts say most coyote aggression toward humans stems from people providing the animals with food, which can drastically alter their behavior. In Arlington, a Boston suburb that saw three nonfatal coyote attacks on children in 2021, police later determined that a resident had been feeding a coyote. Officers killed the animal, and the town has had no problems since, a spokesperson said.\n\nA coyote attack can be so stealthy, it has been mistaken for something more mundane. John Malafronte, a driver for a clothing donation company, was standing in a parking lot in Swampscott, Massachusetts \u2014 across the bay from Nahant \u2014 early one morning in June, smoking a cigarette and texting on his phone, when he felt a pinch and reached to swat what he thought was a fly biting his leg.\n\nWhen he glanced down and saw a coyote instead, \u201cI flipped my lid,\u201d said Malafronte, who suffered a puncture wound and later received rabies shots.\n\nStanley Gehrt, at the Chicago-based Urban Coyote Research Project, has studied coyotes for decades, tracking hundreds of them to learn how they live. He acknowledges that removing coyotes may be appropriate in some situations, but he also reminds nervous suburbanites about the coyote\u2019s role in a healthy ecosystem.\n\nCoyotes can help control populations of rodents, rabbits and Canada geese, Gehrt said; they also prey on white-tailed deer, which cause car accidents and endanger drivers.\n\nCoyotes also offer humans a bracing dose of humility, he noted.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done everything we can to wipe them off the continent for 150 years, and they\u2019re moving into our backyards,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder that we don\u2019t have control of everything.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 2022 The New York Times Company", "label": "human"}

She and the other top 10 CNN Heroes honored at Sunday\u2019s gala all receive a $10,000 cash award and, for the first time, additional grants, organizational training and support from The Elevate Prize Foundation through a new collaboration with CNN Heroes. Nelly will also be named an Elevate Prize winner, which comes with a $300,000 grant and additional support worth $200,000 for her nonprofit.\n\n\u201cThe world is your oyster when you are educated\u201d\n\nCheboi grew up in poverty in Mogotio, a rural township in Kenya. \u201cI know the pain of poverty,\u201d said Cheboi, 29. \u201cI never forgot what it was like with my stomach churning because of hunger at night.\u201d\n\nA hard-working student, Cheboi received a full scholarship to Augustana College in Illinois in 2012. She began her studies there with almost no experience with computers, handwriting papers and struggling to transcribe them onto a laptop.\n\nEverything changed in her junior year, though, when Cheboi took a programming course required for her mathematics major.\n\n\u201cWhen I discovered computer science, I just fell in love with it. I knew that this is something that I wanted to do as my career, and also bring it to my community,\u201d she told CNN.\n\nMany basic computer skills were still a steep learning curve, however. Cheboi remembers having to practice touch-typing for six months before she could pass a coding interview. Touch-typing is a skill that is now a core part of the TechLit curriculum.\n\n\u201cI feel so accomplished seeing kids that are 7 years old touch-typing, knowing that I just learned how to touch-type less than five years ago,\u201d she said.\n\nOnce she had begun working in the software industry, Cheboi soon realized the extent of which computers were being thrown away as companies upgraded their technology infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWe have kids here (in Kenya) \u2014 myself included, back in the day \u2014 who don\u2019t even know what a computer is,\u201d she said.\n\nSo, in 2018, she began transporting donated computers back to Kenya \u2014 in her personal luggage, handling customs fees and taxes herself.\n\n\u201cAt one point, I was bringing 44 computers, and I paid more for the luggage than I did for the air ticket,\u201d she said.\n\nA year later, she co-founded TechLit Africa with a fellow software engineer after both quit their jobs. The nonprofit accepts computer donations from companies, universities and individuals.\n\nThe hardware is wiped and refurbished before it\u2019s shipped to Kenya. There, it\u2019s distributed to partner schools in rural communities, where students ages 4 to 12 receive daily classes and frequent opportunities to learn from professionals, gaining skills that will help improve their education and better prepare them for future jobs.\n\n\u201cWe have people who own a specific skill coming in and are just inspiring the kids (with) music production, video production, coding, personal branding,\u201d Cheboi said. \u201cThey can go from doing a remote class with NASA on education to music production.\u201d\n\nThe organization currently serves 10 schools; within the next year, Cheboi hopes to be partnered with 100 more.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that when the first TechLit kids graduate high school, they\u2019re able to get a job online because they will know how to code, they will know how to do graphic design, they will know how to do marketing,\u201d Cheboi said. \u201cThe world is your oyster when you are educated.

{"text": "The investment case for Best Buy looks murky as retailers face a slowing consumer spending environment, according to Bank of America. Analyst Elizabeth Suzuki downgraded shares of the consumer electronics retailer to underperform from neutral, saying in a note to clients Wednesday that recession fears in 2023 threaten to put a damper on Best Buy's potential for positive earnings growth. The stock shed 3% following the downgrade. \"We believe it is in a strong position in core products and should have opportunities to expand into new categories going forward, although a medium-term pullback on discretionary retail categories presents a headwind to both sales growth and valuation,\" she wrote. Best Buy shares have come under significant pressure this year as retailers grapple with high inflation and a pullback in consumer spending. The stock's down more than 17% year to date, with Bank of America's $69 price target suggesting shares could fall another 18% from Tuesday's close. Suzuki's price target suggests that stock trades at 10 times the bank's 2024 earnings per share forecast, which is below the historic averages for both Best Buy and the hardline retail sector. \"We believe this discount is warranted given the pressure on consumer discretionary spending in light of inflation,\" she wrote. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting", "label": "human"}
{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Calling it among \"the most significant\u201d recent laws to be enacted, President Joe Biden on Friday touted legislation he signed in August that expanded health care benefits for veterans suffering from exposure to toxic burn pits.\n\nThe new law, dubbed the PACT Act, \"empowers the VA to move more quickly to determine if a veteran qualifies for the benefits of the law,\u201d Biden said at a National Guard and Reserve center in New Castle, Del., named after his late son, Beau Biden. \u201cAnd the benefits are real, they\u2019re real benefits like exposure screening. \u2026 It means new facilities, new research, more health care workers at VA hospitals.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor families who suffer the ultimate loss, that means potential access to life insurance, tuition benefits, home loan assistance, monthly stipends \u2014 and it\u2019s real, it\u2019s not small,\u201d he said.\n\nThe issue is personal for Biden, who has said he believes his son's brain cancer was linked to exposure to burn pits during his deployment to Iraq in 2008. In his remarks, Biden said he remembered when Beau, who was diagnosed in 2013, called him to say he had collapsed while running.\n\nSince Biden signed the law, more than 185,000 veterans have applied for benefits, the White House said. More than 730,000 veterans have also received screenings for toxic exposure, with nearly 39% reporting concern of exposure.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs began processing claims for terminally ill veterans Monday, with about 2,500 claims from veterans self-identifying as such, the White House said. The government will begin processing claims for all other veterans in January.\n\nThe law gives veterans exposed to burn pits access to more medical care and disability payments. It also requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to presume some lung illnesses and cancers were related to exposure, meaning veterans don\u2019t have to prove they got sick from the burn pits to receive compensation. Previously, about 70% of disability claims related to burn pits were denied by the VA due to lack of evidence, scientific data and information from the Department of Defense, the Associated Press reported.\n\nBiden said he has directed the Department of Veterans Affairs to treat the 23 presumptive conditions in the law immediately. \u201cI\u2019m urging all veterans of these decades of war to enroll in the VA health care to get screened for toxic exposure and to promptly file your claim,\u201d he said.\n\nBiden spoke about the danger posed by the pits, saying \u201cit\u2019s a hole between eight and 10 feet high, 12 feet deep, the size of a football field, great big rectangle, and every damn ugly thing in our world is burned in it.\u201d\n\nMany of the best-trained, fittest warriors in the world have come home to the U.S. from deployments \u201cwith headaches, numbness, dizziness, cancer,\u201d he said.\n\nExperts have said that while it is difficult to draw a definitive link between burn pit exposure and certain health problems like cancer and asthma, long-term exposure to toxic smoke can lead to serious health issues.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The House Executive Committee on Wednesday released a record of interviews with former President Donald Trump's senior aide about rallying in support of Trump held on the day of the congressional uprising. The records provide a detailed description of the events leading up to the January 6 uprising, as well as new revelations about Trump's interest in the trademark \"manipulating elections\" and other security measures that Trump wants to take at the rally. Trump wants to mark the trademark as a \"false election\"! The record shows that Trump is interested in the phrase \"manipulating elections\" - he often unfoundedly accuses Democrats of cheating in the 2020 election. According to the records, Michael Glassner, chief of staff and political director of the Trump campaign, discussed the issue with Trump in a phone call on December 16. Grasner told Trump that he had begun the process of trademarkizing the phrase. \"It's a great thing, it's a very great thing.\" Glasner also suggested to Trump that he could sell \"fake elections\" merchandise on the campaign website, and Trump agreed. The records also show that Trump is interested in selling \"stop stealing\" goods on campaign websites, a phrase linked to false narratives of the 2020 election being stolen. Trump wants to take additional security measures at a rally on Jan. 6 The records show that Trump wants to take additional security measures for the January 6 rally and is dissatisfied with the Secret Service's refusal to take steps to protect the Capitol. According to former deputy campaign manager Justin Clark, Trump specifically wants to hire 1,000 additional law enforcement officers. Clark also told a House panel that he thinks Trump wants to \"show strength\" and prove to protesters that he is \"with them.\" The Secret Service refused to take additional security measures at the Capitol, citing a lack of adequate resources and staff. The rally was largely peaceful until the violence broke out, with Trump-backed mobs attacking the Capitol shortly before an election vote began. Records show that the Trump team discussed holding a rally at the White House, and that Trump had asked for access to the roof of the Capitol - these requests were not approved. Trump's aides also discussed the issue of delaying the rally. The House Committee's records also show that the Trump team discussed delaying the rally due to an upcoming impeachment vote. Trump campaign manager Bill Stephen told the panel that he and other campaign officials discussed the idea of rescheduling a rally as early as December 28. Stephen said the discussion was triggered by concerns that holding a rally one day before the impeachment vote could be seen as an attempt to intimidate members of Congress, but Trump eventually decided to continue with the rally. Trump says he's not worried about incitement to violence The record shows that Trump has expressed no concern about inciting violence days and hours before a rally in support of Trump. Former White House social media director Dan Scavino testified that in a December 29 phone call, Trump told him: \"Take it, make sure it's big, make sure it's hugely successful.\" According to Stepien, Trump repeated his sentiments at a dinner with campaign advisers on January 5. \"He basically said something, 'We're going to have a crazy time. We're going to show Democrats and the media who is the boss',\" Stephen told the committee. The testimony given to the House panel by Trump's aides and former administration officials clearly portrays a president who wants to deliver his message through an assembly - ultimately overshadowed by the violence that followed at the Capitol.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said in a report on Thursday that global coal use will reach an all-time high this year. The International Energy Agency's (IEA) Coal Report 2020 shows that demand for coal is expected to reach a record 8.4 billion tons of oil equivalent (GTOE) in 2020, an increase of about 3.4% from 2019. This marks the continuation of growing demand for coal in recent years, with global use increasing over the past three years. The report attributes this growth to the continued expansion of coal-fired power plants in some of the world's most populous countries, as well as a rebound in demand from industrial users. Demand growth is particularly striking in Asia, with new capacity in countries such as India and Vietnam driving the industry's recovery. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its report that the world's three largest coal consumers - China, India and the United States - could account for more than two-thirds of global coal demand by 2020. However, it warned that their dependence on fossil fuels could lead to long-term energy transition problems if current trends continue unchecked. \"Unless policies to accelerate the shift away from coal are implemented quickly, our latest outlook shows that global coal-fired power generation capacity and associated CO2 emissions will continue to increase by 2040,\" said Dr Fatih Birol, IEA's Executive Director. The International Energy Agency (IEA)'s warning comes from growing concerns about the environment and climate change. In recent years, governments around the world have tried to reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants, but progress has been slow. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said governments should take stronger action to accelerate the coal transition, including by encouraging investment in renewable energy and phasing out coal subsidies. The agency also noted that coal could still play a role in the energy transition if the industry develops low-carbon technologies such as carbon capture and storage. The International Energy Agency (IEA) report comes at a time when environmentalists are increasingly calling on governments to take more decisive action to phase out coal. Last month, the United Nations Environment Programme warned that in order to meet its climate goals, the world needs \"transformative\" reforms of its energy system. At the same time, however, the International Energy Agency said it was important to note that coal still plays an important role in the global energy mix, accounting for about 27% of the world's major energy needs. This is slightly down from its 29% level in 2019, but remains a significant share. \"While a large part of the global energy system still relies on coal, our latest analysis shows that the trend is turning around.\"A growing number of countries have made clear commitments to accelerate the transition from coal, and despite this year's significant rebound, global demand for coal will remain below its previous peak and continue to decline over the next 20 years,\" said Dr Birol.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Leon Cooperman, the former chairman of billionaire investor and hedge fund Omega Advisors, recently said he didn't believe people were talking about a new bull market coming. However, this does not mean that investors are moving away from the market. Instead, Cooperman says he has taken a more selective approach to looking for individual stocks that he believes are currently undervalued. \"I'm always focused on value. I look at the market based on individual stocks,\" Cooperman said Tuesday in an interview with CNBC's Squarewk on the Street. Cooperman said he has been looking for stocks that have been undervalued due to macroeconomic headwinds, but those stocks still offer good value to investors. \"I'm looking for companies that have good values and good fundamentals but are undervalued by macroeconomic consideration,\" he said. \"But I'm also looking for companies that have good values and good fundamentals in a bullish environment.\" He also noted that stocks in the industrial and energy sectors are areas of opportunity, adding that he has been taking a long-term view of these sectors. \"We've been focusing on energy and industry, and we've always taken a long-term view,\" he said. Cooperman went on to explain why he thought the market would not enter a new bull market any time soon, citing geopolitical uncertainties in the United States and Europe as well as the ongoing U.S.-China trade war as reasons for his hesitation. \"I think the geopolitical uncertainty will continue for quite some time,\" he said, \"and I don't think this market is going to enter a new bull market anytime soon.\" Still, Cooperman said he believes the market remains an attractive place to invest and that recent corrections may have brought some buying opportunities. \"The market has been overvalued for some time, and this may be a necessary adjustment,\" he said. The investor noted that some of his current portfolio choices illustrate his approach. He said he took a long-term view of certain stocks in the industrial sector (such as Generac Holdings and Whirlpool) and justified their relatively cheap valuation for investment. Cooperman said he had been looking for stocks that might have gone up because of current fundamentals and macroeconomic factors. He said he found some energy stocks, which he believed were currently undervalued, citing British Petroleum (BP) and Total as examples of stocks that could benefit from higher oil prices. \"There are some stock markets that have missed them, which is an opportunity for us,\" he said. At the same time, Cooperman said that he has been using options to protect his portfolio from significant market volatility. He said that he has been using options to hedge against any potential decline in the market and take advantage of certain upside potential. In general, Cooperman said he still believes in the stock market and its opportunities. He said that the key is to look at individual stocks rather than the overall market, and focus on value and fundamentals. \"I think there's always opportunity in the market,\" he said, \"but you have to be selective and you have to look at individual stocks. I think it's an opportunity to look at individual stocks and make good investments.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Noah likes to feed the squirrels naked. I don\u2019t know if he does it this way when I am not here. But like clockwork on the weekend mornings we spend together, the squirrels will start to tap on the window. And Noah will rise from the bed as if responding to a baby monitor. He will stumble to the kitchen, grab a handful of unsalted almonds from a jar in the cabinet, return to the bedroom, and crack the window an inch, popping the almonds out one by one so they land on the sill in a line.\n\nThe squirrels live in the saw-whet owl nesting house he bought and placed on the corner of his fire escape. For a few hours each morning, they pad back and forth across the windowsill, balancing on the black steel ribbons of the landing, waiting for him to put out breakfast, then second breakfast, then snack. If no almonds are waiting for them on the sill, the squirrels will knock loudly on the window until he wakes up. They stand on their hind legs like tiny Peeping Toms and stare at us in bed until food appears. They will knock and stare if we are sleeping, or reading, or having sex.\n\nA poem by Ellen Bass: \u2018The Squirrel\u2019\n\nThe squirrel house is made of cedar and has a hunter-green composite roof. When Noah first showed it to me while lying in bed one afternoon, I didn\u2019t pay much attention. I\u2019m a single mother living in the Long Island suburbs, while Noah is a single man in his 40s in Brooklyn. We are both divorced. Spending $60 on a small house that may or may not get used by squirrels seemed frivolous to me, but in the middle of the pandemic, any kind of distraction also felt worth it.\n\nNoah was far from the only person taking solace in squirrels during the pandemic. Around this time, in May 2020, we watched Mark Rober\u2019s video \u201cBackyard Squirrel Maze 1.0 -Ninja Warrior Course\u201d on YouTube. After cadres of the small animals destroyed his squirrel-proof backyard bird feeders, Rober built a course designed to challenge the squirrels\u2019 mental and physical abilities. Those that made it to the end received the prize of \u201ca butt-ton of walnuts.\u201d The video has 107 million views.\n\nMany of those views came from my own household. During the first year and a half of the pandemic, I spent my weekdays away from Noah\u2019s place in my apartment with my two children. Third and fourth grade, then fourth and fifth grade, took place in the living room via Google Classroom, while I taught my college courses over Zoom in my bedroom. I could also watch squirrels chase one another through the branches of the towering old oak tree in my backyard, but they never came close enough to feed. I was more interested in birds, anyway. Noah bought us a glossy blue egg-shaped feeder to hang from the tree.\n\nThe first few days, the kids enjoyed watching the birds land and chatter while they ate the seed. The kids\u2019 teachers would be droning desperately on the computer, but my sons would be looking outside, entranced by the bird dramas. They would report their sightings of cardinals and mourning doves and finches when we all came to the table for lunch each day.\n\nOne morning, the glossy blue egg was hanging sideways by its steel string. A pile of birdseed was on the ground, and squirrels were munching away. I shooed them off, repaired the feeder, strung it back up. From my bedroom upstairs, I watched as a squirrel climbed the oak\u2019s trunk until he was parallel to the bird feeder, and then he launched himself onto the orb. Over and over, he would jump and skitter and flop off. Over and over, he would climb back up, adjusting his height and angle, until he finally stuck his landing. Stretching his body vertically so that he hung nearly upside down, the squirrel worked the metal dish and dowel at the bottom of the feeder until birdseed was scattered everywhere.\n\nA few mornings later, I came downstairs to make coffee, and the feeder itself was lying on the ground atop a giant pile of seed. Birds and squirrels were enjoying the party. I walked out with my coffee cup to assess the damage, shaking my head but also marveling at the ingenuity of the little bastards. I went to refill the feeder, but when I pulled out the plastic bin I used to store seed, I discovered that the handle had been chewed off. Apparently, the squirrels had found the source and feasted on that too.\n\nNoah first noticed his squirrels because a neighbor a few floors up kept a bird feeder on the fire escape. Every morning and afternoon, the squirrels would scamper up and down the steps, chasing the rain of seeds that would pour forth when one or another shook the feeder vigorously. When he was suddenly working from home every day, alone in the quarantine months, these squirrels would often be the only living beings he saw for days. The squirrels would pause at his window to eat the birdseed, and he enjoyed watching how they perched on the edge of the ironwork and observed the dogs and humans going by on the sidewalk. They became part of his day, and so he thought about how to make them more comfortable, how to make them stay.\n\nFrom the October 2021 issue: An ode to squirrels\n\nIn an article about the history of squirrels in New York, Sadie Stein wrote that in 1968 100,000 drowned squirrels were pulled out of a reservoir. This mass death was linked to a phenomenon that occurred across the eastern United States called the Great Squirrel Migration. After a robust year for acorns in 1967, squirrel births skyrocketed. Unfortunately, that plenty was temporary; 1968 was an unusually bad year for acorns, and it is likely that squirrels left their usual homes in search of more food. In September of that year, hundreds of thousands died on highways, or while crossing bodies of water. Squirrels are not agile swimmers, using a kind of doggy-paddle technique that requires a lot of energy to cross a short distance, and they are known to die of exhaustion when crossing bodies of water.\n\nThe squirrels migrated because they were desperate. I worried that Noah was like their 1967 bounty\u2014unreliable and temporary. When we went away on vacation for a week, he asked his friend Ryan to stop by to water his plants and feed the squirrels. As the weeks passed, we named the squirrels, and every few months they seemed to change up, with different squirrels taking ownership of the house. Noah calmed my anxiety about dependence by reporting back that while the squirrels usually eat the first few nuts they grab, they also collected nuts and ran down to the apartment building\u2019s lawn to bury them. They were storing their caches. They seemed to know it is not safe to rely on a single source of sustenance.\n\nIn our respective divorces, Noah and I had both lost places we\u2019d loved. We\u2019d both had the experience of feeling at home, of feeling like we\u2019d found the place we\u2019d be for the long term. We also knew what it meant to have to pack up and leave. His ex-wife still lived in his old apartment. A new family had moved into my house after my ex-husband and I agreed to sell it. I\u2019m not sure which is worse.\n\nHe\u2019d had squirrels at his previous apartment too, though he had not cultivated them\u2014there was a fallow planter on his fire-escape ledge, and one morning he woke up to a bundle of sleeping squirrels curled around one another. I think this was when he first fell in love with them.\n\nFor most of our relationship, we both lived in what we called our in-between places, him in Brooklyn, me in the suburbs. We both missed our old homes; we both felt unsettled where we were. Our current apartments were pass-throughs, and we knew it, though we didn\u2019t know what we were passing through to.\n\nNoah and I had been talking about moving in together before COVID hit, but every time the discussion circled too closely to reality, one or the other of us would balk. I\u2019d never introduced the kids to anyone I\u2019d dated before. Noah and I dated for two years before he met them, and then the four of us went climbing together, and running, and to the zoo. Noah and I were moving toward something, but with no timeline. Until the pandemic, we\u2019d both enjoyed living on our own, were ambivalent about marriage, were working on ourselves after our respective shipwrecks. Neither of us was in a hurry to change anything.\n\nMy maternal great-grandfather had a summer cottage in Tappan, New York, where he kept gardens. He used to treat the squirrels like pets, my mother remembers, and would often walk around his garden with a squirrel on his shoulder or perched on his hat, as he fed the animal nuts from his pocket.\n\nBut squirrels are not pets. One day, while riding on my grandfather\u2019s head, a squirrel sunk its claws into the side of my great-grandfather\u2019s face and ripped it apart. This is one of the few stories I know about the man: He worked for a French steamship company, he loved his gardens and his granddaughter and squirrels, and one of them nearly took out his eye.\n\nRead: Admit it, squirrels are just tree rats\n\nI imagine him strolling in his gardens before that awful morning, smiling contentedly while making his granddaughter giggle by tossing peanuts to the squirrel on his shoulder. I imagine he might have thought I have everything I wanted, the same way Noah and I did for a period in our respective homes before our divorces. When you live with a person you love, you think you have an understanding; you think We\u2019re in this together and Things will always feel this good. I imagine my great-grandfather\u2019s pride must have stung along with his face that day, the same way mine stung when I signed away my farmhouse. We both should have known better.\n\nNoah promised he would never open the window more than an inch to pop a nut out onto the sill, would never try to pet them. I mostly believed him. From what I could see, Noah and the squirrels seemed content to live alongside each other. The squirrels munched happily on the fire escape as Noah sat and chatted to them from the other side of the window. Sometimes, if a storm blew the nesting house too close to the open ledge, Noah would poke the green handle of his broomstick out of the window and nudge it securely into the corner of the fire escape again.\n\nAccording to National Geographic, there are more than 200 types of squirrels in the world. Many people consider them akin to chipmunks or bunnies, but make no mistake: They are in the rodent family and, like rats, their front teeth never stop growing. In New York City, the Parks Department notes that the majority of the squirrels we see are eastern gray squirrels, though they are not necessarily gray. Often they make their homes in trees, stitching together a palace of leaves called a drey. There is typically enough room for two squirrels in a drey, and a male and female might share the space during mating season. The females nest alone when pregnant. They usually give birth to a brood of two to six babies in winter, and another in summer.\n\nMother squirrels with babies are often described as living alone. By the time the pandemic hit, I had lived with my children for five years, and I certainly never felt like I lived alone. Even on the weekends they spent with their father, they remained present in our place through the drawings taped to the walls, the stray socks they peel and fling around the living room while doing homework or watching television, the drawer of multicolored children\u2019s cutlery next to the adult stainless-steel forks and knives. And yet, during the pandemic, when friends would text to check up on me, I realized this is how many saw me: living alone, with children. Squirrels and humans, it seems, require an adult partner in order to be considered not alone.\n\nThis aloneness was a bitter topic between Noah and me during the pandemic. As alone as I might have seemed, Noah was actually alone. And no amount of Facetime or texting could change that. I was jealous of this. After days of teaching in my room; preparing breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner, and dessert; overseeing Zoom elementary school and homework, getting the kids out for walks or to throw a ball; bingeing Survivor or the next Wings of Fire book, all I wanted was a minute alone. All Noah wanted was a minute with me.\n\nI felt alternately smothered and cozy. Every week I\u2019d oversee our homelife. Every other weekend, I\u2019d drive the children to their father\u2019s and then continue on to Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn. During the first year of the pandemic, Noah\u2019s apartment was an oasis. Noah is tidy, loves clean lines, is a phenomenal cook. Years earlier, the first night I stayed over, he\u2019d made me breakfast in his underwear. This was in his old apartment, the one he\u2019d bought when he was still married, before the divorce was finalized and the apartment became hers. I sat perched on the stool at the big marble island and told myself over and over, Just sit here and enjoy this. I watched him from the other side of the island as he moved between chopping vegetables and whisking what he called \u201chotel eggs\u201d in the double boiler\u2014his face set in concentration, a clutch of black hair falling in his eyes\u2014and was content.\n\nI feel the same way when he feeds the squirrels. I turn in bed to watch him. He is dutiful and precise and talks to them as he delivers the almonds. He experimented with walnuts and peanuts, but the squirrels seem to prefer almonds. \u201cIt\u2019s pear day!\u201d he announced one morning, sliding slices of pear out onto the windowsill. \u201cWait your turn,\u201d he\u2019ll chide if two begin to bicker. When he spots a squirrel with two long rows of pink nipples, it makes him happy knowing there are going to be babies. He leaves cotton balls out for the mama to insulate her nest in the winter, and the stuffing soon pokes out between the cedar slats of the nesting house.\n\nNoah is a caretaker. The first winter in his pass-through apartment, mice invaded. He used glue traps and, multiple mornings before work each week, he placed a frightened mouse in a cardboard box and carted it over to a patch of grass near a horse stable, where he would pull a vial of olive oil out of his pocket and grease the creature\u2019s feet until it could free itself from the glue and scamper off. He did this over and over until the building management finally repaired the wall behind his dishwasher where the mice were getting in. At the end of her life, Noah\u2019s geriatric Italian greyhound could no longer make the jump up to the bed. She could relax only when Noah was next to her, so he slept on the floor. For months.\n\nRead: Squirrels are professional eavesdroppers\n\nI believe, wholeheartedly, in snap-traps. I don\u2019t think I would sleep on the floor for months for a dog. I questioned my capacity to care for other humans until I became a mother. Not much about that came naturally\u2014I never felt comfortable with baby talk or babies, generally, and I often joke that I do not like children, only mine. But the love, the care, the putting them first\u2014these things became simply part of my body, the same way my children were.\n\nOnce, at the farmhouse, I fell down the porch stairs while carrying my second son in the crook of one arm and pruning shears in the other. The baby was in that squishy-all-over phase; even his skull was still soft. My ankle twisted at the top of the porch, and without thinking or trying, I tossed the shears to the side as we tumbled, twisting my body so that I was between the baby and the bluestone slab beneath us. He was so much lighter than me that he inhabited a different gravitational force, and for a moment, we were like acrobats, reaching for one another across the air. And then I was on the ground on my back, and he was on my chest, and we were both so stunned that it took a moment for us to cry.\n\nIn addition to my children, I want to care for another person like that on purpose. I want it to be intentional, not reflex. A person I choose, not a person who is an extension of my own body.\n\nWhen we found the house we wanted to buy together, it was a surprise. When we put an offer in, we didn\u2019t expect for it to go through\u2014this was in the height of the 2022 real-estate boom. We were the last appointment of the weekend to see the small yellow cape on a corner lot. It was surrounded by gardens and flowering trees. When Noah saw the amount of natural light in the kitchen, he turned to me. \u201cI think this might be our house,\u201d he whispered.\n\nWe were surprised again when, a week later, we were under contract. The reality of what we\u2019d done began to set in. There was anxiety and fear. Mostly, though, we were excited to wake up together each morning, excited to begin living in a home that felt like it was more than a pass-through.\n\nThat following weekend, as usual, I dropped the children at their father\u2019s apartment and made my way to Ocean Parkway. After a candlelit dinner with wine discussing paint colors and lawyers, we went to bed. And at 6 a.m., like clockwork, a small tapping on the window woke us up.\n\nI opened my eyes. Noah was already rising from the bed. He cracked the window and said good morning; it was the squirrel we\u2019d named Racecar a few weeks earlier because of the strange stripe of fur missing down her back, as if someone had taken a razor and just ran it along her body from her head to her tail. When the squirrel had first shown up, we\u2019d thought it was a male, but soon nipples popped out like little pink buttons. It was April. The gestation period of a gray squirrel is about 40 days. She\u2019d probably give birth in June, around our fifth anniversary. Around our closing date. Around the time Noah would need to leave his apartment. The squirrel accepted the treats, and Noah returned to bed.\n\nHe looked at me, then looked back at the squirrel munching on her breakfast. \u201cI know,\u201d he sighed.\n\nA group of squirrels is called a scurry. A family of squirrels is called a drey. When I learned this term, I thought it must be incorrect, but the word for a squirrel home and a squirrel family are, in fact, the same.\n\nNoah is afraid that he will not be able to enter the circle of closeness between my children and me, that it will always be the three of us and him, rather than simply us, all four together. I am not able to confidently erase this fear for him. Home has meant the three of us for many years now. We enjoy it; I like living alone with my children. To me, this seemed like the best way to ensure our survival. But as I watch the way things flourish under Noah\u2019s care, I\u2019m not convinced that my theory holds up.\n\nI imagine our new house, with the children\u2019s socks tucked in the couch corners and their art on the walls, Noah\u2019s rescue cactus in some sunlit corner, hotel eggs on the stove. I will try to hang the glossy blue bird feeder again, and Noah will find new squirrels. I hope that this home will be one of safety and security, of caretaking and caregiving, of joy and helping one another grow. But I know the statistics. Although they can live up to 12 years in the wild, only 25 percent of gray squirrels survive their first year. Success rates for second marriages are almost equally dire. I don\u2019t plan on marrying again, but I recognize that my magical thinking (if we don\u2019t get married, we won\u2019t get divorced!) can\u2019t keep us safe in the way I might hope.\n\nAs we research strategies to soften the blow of Noah\u2019s leaving on his squirrels, I stumble upon a hopeful fact. Squirrels typically keep a second drey nearby. They know their nests are fragile, prone to predators or storms or mite infestations, and so they have a backup plan, the same way they bury stores of nuts in the fall so that they will have enough food during the winter.\n\nThis does not guarantee that they will survive, of course. The Great Squirrel Migration followed a year of plenty; even in typical times, most squirrels will die in their first year of life. The mothers know this, and they curl tightly into their babies in their nests for as long as they can. But they can\u2019t stay there forever, because not moving is certain death. So they make their backup plans, and fortify their dreys to the best of their abilities. And they hope for the best.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Prolific stadium builder Bob Dunn, advising the Lightfoot administration on how to fix Soldier Field to keep the Bears in Chicago, released detailed plans Sunday for transforming the isolated stadium into a year-round commercial and entertainment hub, served by a transit station that would underpin his goal of residential expansion on the Near South Side.\n\nDunn estimated that his proposal to dome Soldier Field, working within its existing footprint, would save the Bears at least $1 billion over the cost of building from the ground up in Arlington Heights, where the team has a contract to purchase land.\n\nDunn, president of Landmark Development, said the proposed new Soldier Field and surrounding activity would fatten city tax coffers while giving the Bears and the team\u2019s fans a facility that would be among the tops for NFL teams.\n\nHis credentials include involvement in MetLife Stadium in New Jersey and every stadium for the Bears\u2019 rivals in the NFC North Division.\n\nIn an interview, he offered images that promise that Soldier Field\u2019s design, which has been likened to a crashed spaceship, could become something thrilling.\n\n\u201cHaving built a number of NFL stadiums, having built other sports venues \u2026 having built Lambeau Field, which is consistently ranked as one of the top buildings in all of sports by fans, taking that building and then transforming it to become what it\u2019s become, there is not an opportunity in the sports industry in the United States, I would argue, that matches the opportunity here,\u201d Dunn said.\n\nMayor Lori Lightfoot brought in Dunn last July to help in her effort to keep the Bears in Chicago. He said he\u2019s unpaid for the role, that he has developed the plans at Landmark Development\u2019s expense. He timed the release of his plan to the Bears\u2019 final game of the season.\n\nHe spells out his vision with a website, reimaginesoldierfield.com, that includes a video narrated by former TV news anchor Bill Kurtis.\n\nA rendering showing how Soldier Field\u2019s colonnades could be incorporated into the improvements. Landmark Development\n\nDunn said he hasn\u2019t reviewed the plan with the Bears.\n\nTeam officials have they they are sticking to a contractual obligation and talking only with Arlington Heights officials about what they can build on the former site of Arlington Park racetrack. The Bears have a contract to buy the 326 acres for $197.2 million but could back out of the deal.\n\nThe Lightfoot administration has estimated that a Soldier Field redevelopment, dome and all, could cost $2.2 billion.\n\nDunn\u2019s plan includes a glassy north wall he said could be opened depending on the weather. Stadium capacity could be in the \u201chigh-60s,\u201d he said, compared with the current 61,500 seats.\n\nCity officials promised a feasibility study of public financing options last year but have provided no updates.\n\nFunding would surely be controversial because of the likely hit on taxpayers and the amount still unpaid on debt from Soldier Field\u2019s 2003 renovation. The Illinois Sports Facilities Authority, which handles the debt, said the amount owed is $631.5 million on notes due by 2032.\n\nThe End Zone Club under a proposal for a revamped Soldier Field. Landmark Development\n\nDunn said the city\u2019s $2.2 billion cost estimate was reasonable but that inflation and rising interest rates inevitably would affect the project. He wouldn\u2019t discuss taxpayer funding.\n\nHe predicted that Arlington Heights would cost far more and deliver less for the team and taxpayers.\n\nSoldier Field draws from a central area that gets 50 million visitors a year, with 100 million vehicles a year zipping by on Du Sable Lake Shore Drive.\n\n\u201cThose are Disney-like numbers,\u201d Dunn said.\n\nArlington Heights, he said, might draw eight to 12 million annual visitors.\n\nDunn said the city and the Bears could strike new revenue-sharing deals covering parking, concessions, corporate sponsorships and other income sources.\n\n\u201cYou have to have a different revenue mix,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can be solved. It\u2019s been solved in a lot of markets across the country.\u201d\n\nThe Lightfoot administration responded to questions about Dunn\u2019s plan with a written statement that offered no new details of public funding options.\n\n\u201cMayor Lightfoot has been vocal about the need to reimagine the experience at Soldier Field,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe city still believes that Soldier Field is the best home for the Chicago Bears and continues to . . . explore the future of the stadium.\u201d\n\nWith less than two months before the mayoral election, Dunn\u2019s expanded presentation could be seen as a move to boost Lightfoot\u2019s chances by showcasing her commitment to the lakefront asset. Dunn said his concern is planning, not politics.\n\n\u201cWe have to have a vision here for the future of Soldier Field\u201d whether the Bears move or not, he said. \u201cI think any administration would look at this very favorably.\u201d\n\nScott Hagel, senior vice president of marketing and communications for the Bears, stuck with the tenor of the club\u2019s recent statements about stadium matters, saying, \u201cThe only proposal we are exploring is in Arlington Heights.\u201d\n\nIn Dunn\u2019s outline, Soldier Field would keep its name and its tradition of honoring veterans, with a memorial to armed forces within the building. Its colonnades would stay in place, but the space around them would become active with shops and maybe a food hall.\n\nHis plan calls for a concert stage north of the arena near the Field Museum.\n\nA view of the concert stage that could be Soldier Field\u2019s neighbor. Landmark Development\n\nThe dome would be supported by four columns added near the end zones, prime opportunities for corporate sponsors, Dunn said. Building into what\u2019s now dead space around the stands, he said, would put an end to the current cramped concourses.\n\nThe project could take three to four years to complete, he said.\n\nThe proposal has two main assumptions.\n\nOne is that costs could be held down by using 70% of the existing stadium structure, including the seating bowls, which Dunn said provide an intimate view of games.\n\nThe other assumption is that he can change how fans get to Soldier Field. Most drive now, but Dunn said that, with a transit connection next to the stadium, 40% of the crowd could arrive by rail, comparing the game-day commuting patterns to Wrigley Field.\n\nThe transit hub is a clue to Dunn\u2019s vested interest in helping Soldier Field. It\u2019s a principal part of his plan for a megadevelopment of up to nine highrises built over Metra\u2019s tracks west of the stadium. The plan is called One Central and, as previously sketched out, could cost $20 billion and include more than 9,000 residences.\n\nOne Central needs that transit station \u2014 seen as a junction for the CTA, Metra and Amtrak \u2014 to get people to the future buildings. But its cost is estimated at $6.5 billion. Dunn has promised to fund the construction, provided the state repays him from sales taxes resulting from the development.\n\nCritics have called the public obligation risky. The state has ordered a feasibility study of the transit hub but reserved any decision for giving Dunn a go-ahead.\n\nHe still needs city zoning approval to build One Central, and his original plan has drawn fire from nearby residents and some politicians. Much of the opposition centers on density and access to the site.\n\nDunn said the plan could be downsized.\n\n\u201dI think it\u2019s fair to say we\u2019ve learned a lot, and I think we\u2019ll be able to demonstrate that in what we learned, we made some very significant improvements in the plan.\u201d\n\nDeveloper Bob Dunn discusses how a transit hub can improve access to Soldier Field.

{"text": "Despite a painful year for internet stocks, opportunities in the beaten-up sector are plentiful for investors positioning for a recovery, according to top tech analyst Mark Mahaney. It was a tough year for the sector as valuations tumbled from record highs in an environment defined by rising rates and fears of slowing economic growth. Against this backdrop, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is down more than 31% from its height and about 30% this year, but a comeback may loom on the horizon. While Mahaney viewed the sector cautiously in 2022, the comedown in both estimates and multiples, coupled with cost-cutting initiatives like layoffs, positions many of these names for an \"EPS slingshot opportunity\" when a recovery occurs in 2023 or 2024, he said. \"We would especially highlight stocks going into '23 where we believe: a) revenue models are reasonably recession resilient; b) there are new product cycles; and c) cost actions have already been taken,\" the Evercore ISI analyst wrote. Here are some of Mahaney's favorite internet plays: Netflix shares have suffered one of the more gruesome routs this year, with the stock slumping about 47% as the company shared subscriber losses and battled growing streaming competition . The stock's bounced back from its lows, offering a 76% return since July 1. Big banks like Bank of America and Wells Fargo recently upgraded the stock, viewing upside from Netflix's ad-supported tier. Similarly, Mahaney views the company's cheaper ad-supported tier as a slightly recession-protective offering that can also drive a reacceleration in revenue growth. Heading into the new year, Mahaney also likes Uber , with the firm's price target suggesting shares can nearly triple from Friday's close. Despite suffering a loss in its recent quarter, the ride-sharing giant posted strong forward guidance and a revenue beat as lockdowns ease and consumers return to travel. Shares are down about 37% this year. Mahaney also named Booking Holdings among his top internet picks, highlighting the company's roughly $1.1 trillion total addressable market opportunity and \"asset-light\" business model. Booking shares have tumbled about 16% this year. Mahaney's $2,600 price target suggests shares could gain 29% from Friday's close. During a recent interview with CNBC's \"Closing Bell,\" Mahaney called Booking one of his favorite travel plays heading into the new year , given its solid management team and cautious approach to its cost structure. \"They could arguably grow faster \u2014 post-Covid, post-normalization \u2014 than they were back in 2019,\" he said. \"That's a good story to put together.\" Names like online-dating app Bumble and web software company Wix were also included in Mahaney's top picks list. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting", "label": "human"}

In the two weeks prior to January 4, China reported fewer than 20 deaths from local Covid cases, according to figures released on the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention website.\n\nWHO officials, who have grappled with China\u2019s tight control of data access throughout the pandemic, have become increasingly vocal in their calls for reliable information as a major outbreak rips across China\u2019s urban centers in the wake of an abrupt relaxation of disease controls last month.\n\nThere, the outbreak has overwhelmed hospitals and crematoriums, triggered shortages of basic medicines, and sparked fears of an even darker month ahead as experts warn of a spread to less resourced rural areas during the upcoming Lunar New Year.\n\nThe surge in cases in a country of 1.4 billion has also raised global concerns about the potential emergence of new variants \u2013 and of China\u2019s levels of monitoring and sharing data. A number of economies have implemented Covid testing requirements for travelers from China, citing a dearth of data on strains circulating there.\n\nOn Wednesday, the European Union \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d its member states to introduce a requirement for a negative Covid test for passengers traveling from China to the EU, according to a statement released by the Swedish presidency of the bloc.\n\nThe WHO\u2019s Tedros said Wednesday it was \u201cunderstandable\u201d that some countries were taking these steps, \u201cwith circulation in China so high and comprehensive data not forthcoming.\u201d\n\nChinese health officials presented recent genomic data to a WHO advisory body during a closed-door meeting Tuesday. The variants detected there are known and have been circulating in other countries, with no new variant yet reported by the China CDC, the body said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nBut the group and WHO officials continued to stress the need for more forthcoming genomic data. The latest situation adds to longstanding challenges for the UN body, which faced criticism at the start of the pandemic that it did not push China hard enough for data, amid concerns Beijing was obscuring critical information. Beijing has repeatedly defended its transparency.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more data that needs to be shared from China and additionally from around the world so that we can track this pandemic as we enter this fourth year,\u201d Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO\u2019s technical lead on Covid, said Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe need more information on sequencing around the country, (and for) those sequences to be shared with publicly available databases like GISAID so that deeper analyses can be done,\u201d she said. GISAID is a global initiative that provides access to the genomic data of different influenza viruses.\n\nInformation about China\u2019s outbreak would also be shared with WHO member states during a broader meeting on Thursday, WHO officials said.", "label": "human"}

Of those, 22 were 737 Maxes.\n\nThe Virginia-based manufacturer's commercial aircraft unit had told investors that the flaw would impact its delivery numbers for the month.\n\n\"We'll recover on that quickly,\" Stan Deal, chief executive of Boeing's commercial airplane unit, said during an investor event last week. \"We can surge and we will recover for our deliveries at the end of the year, but that adverse quality which we have to manage out of the system was an impact.\"\n\nBoeing is making about 31 of the 737s a month. Last week, it told investors that it expects to deliver between 400 and 450 of its 737s next year, up from about 375 planes this year.\n\nThe company logged orders for 122 of its 737 Max planes in October from carriers including Alaska Airlines and British Airways' parent International Consolidated Airlines Group.\n\nSupply chain problems and labor shortages have prevented the manufacturer from ramping production up further, an issue that has hit rival Airbus, too, just as travelers are returning in droves. JetBlue and United are among the airlines that have complained about aircraft delivery delays.\n\nBoeing last week laid out a recovery plan for investors and analysts that forecast a return to annual sales of around $100 billion by the middle of this decade. CEO Dave Calhoun said the company could introduce a new airplane, but not until the middle of the next decade since advances in engine technology don't yet warrant enough of a fuel cut to draw buyers.\n\nThe company has struggled since two deadly crashes of the 737 in 2018 and 2019, the Covid-19 pandemic, manufacturing flaws that paused handovers of its 787 Dreamliners, and problems in its defense unit, including delays and cost overruns of the two 747s that are slated to eventually serve as Air Force One.", "label": "human"}

{"text": ".. On January 3, 2023, the National Executive Council of Myanmar issued a notice on its official website allowing amnesty for more than 7,000 prisoners. It was part of a growing effort by the Burmese military government to ease tensions in the country after the coup d'etat on Feb. 1, which sparked massive protests across the country. According to the statement, the amnesty will cover those convicted of misdemeanours such as causing public inconvenience and those imprisoned for political activities, including members of pro-democracy political parties. The statement did not specify the exact number of people to be released, but said the amnesty was granted for \"compassionate reasons\". The news of the amnesty was welcomed by civil society groups in Myanmar, which have been calling for the release of all political prisoners since the military took control of the government in February. However, Amnesty International warned that the amnesty did not address the root causes of the current crisis in Myanmar and urged the junta to release all political prisoners. There is also no mention in the bulletin of people who have been released or bailed under an amnesty last December, which Amnesty says must be unconditionally released. The Burmese military government has also not released any information on the total number of political prisoners in the country, with the United Nations estimating that more than 2,000 people have been arrested since the coup d'etat, while activists and civil society organizations believe this figure exceeds 5,000. At the same time, the coup d'etat and ongoing protests have sparked international condemnation and led to international sanctions against Myanmar. The United States has imposed sanctions on Burma's military and its commercial subsidiaries, while the European Union has halted investment in the Southeast Asian country. At the same time, the UN Human Rights Council launched an investigation into human rights abuses by the military, including the use of lethal force against peaceful protesters. The situation in Myanmar has been further complicated by the country &apos; s recent decision to postpone the general elections scheduled for this month. The military said that the elections would be postponed until \"stabilisation\" and \"inclusive dialogue and national reconciliation are achieved in the country\". However, the military government has so far been unable to provide any details on when the elections will be held. Amnesty and postponed elections could provide some temporary relief to the Burmese people as they wait for a political crisis to be resolved. At the same time, the international community is urging the restoration of democracy and the release of all political prisoners. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement that he was \"shocked\" by Myanmar's military government for human rights violations and urged them to respect the rights of its people. He also called for an immediate end to the military coup, the release of all those who had been arbitrarily detained and an end to violence against protesters. The Secretary-General also warned of \"serious consequences\" if the military regime did not comply with the demands of the international community. For now, the world will see whether the Myanmar military government's amnesty paves the way for a peaceful resolution of the crisis or is only a temporary suspension in the ongoing struggle for democracy and human rights.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "As global temperatures continue to rise, Cambodia's farmers are struggling to sustain their businesses. Unpredictability of climate change, reduced water resources and increased pest and disease stress caused by climate change have put tremendous pressure on the country's agricultural sector. Because of low production and high input costs, many people are unable to sustain their livelihoods. In the face of rising debt, many are taking extreme measures to survive. In Cambodia, microcredit is the only formal source of credit for individuals who do not have access to traditional banking services. For farmers, these loans can save lives and give them the opportunity to buy important agricultural inputs such as seeds, tools and pesticides to help protect their crops from pests and diseases. According to the World Bank, there are currently more than 100 active microfinance institutions in Cambodia. However, while microloans may be the only solution for some farmers, they also carry many risks. MFIs often charge extremely high interest rates, which means that if farmers can't repay their loans, they will soon find themselves in a worse financial position than before. Unfortunately, this is the reality that many farmers in Cambodia are now facing. Despite their best efforts, many farmers cannot repay their loans, putting them at risk of losing their livelihoods. As the effects of climate change continue to affect the country &apos; s agricultural sector, unless immediate action is taken, the situation may worsen and the Government is making efforts to provide assistance to struggling farmers, including by providing loan subsidies and helping build agricultural infrastructure. However, more needs to be done if Cambodia is to truly protect its farmers and build the capacity to respond to climate change. In addition to government assistance, it is important to make credit easier for farmers so that they can have access to resources needed to preserve crops and their futures. The challenge of helping Cambodian farmers remains daunting. But, if the country is to build a sustainable future, it is clear that increased investment in microcredit and other forms of support are essential.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Paul Constant is a writer at Civic Ventures and the cohost of the \"Pitchfork Economics\" podcast.\n\nHe recently spoke with economist David Wessel about \"opportunity zones\" in the 2017 tax plan.\n\nWessel said the plan for these zones became little more than a tax cut for the super-rich.\n\nTop editors give you the stories you want \u2014 delivered right to your inbox each weekday.

It handed hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts to America's wealthiest people and corporations under the flimsy premise that these economic benefits would somehow translate to economic benefits for everyone else.\n\nIt didn't work, of course. Trickle-down economics never works. The $4,000 annual raise that former speaker of the House Paul Ryan promised American households would see in the form of higher wages never materialized. The Trump tax cuts didn't increase investments in American business \u2014 in fact, the wealth created for the richest Americans from those tax cuts likely wound up overseas.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin promised that the tax plan would \"pay for itself\" with economic growth, but that economic growth never materialized. Instead, the Congressional Budget Office found that corporate tax revenue fell by over 30% the year after the tax cuts passed.\n\nWe're still unraveling all the harm that the 2017 Trump tax bill has done to the economy. In his new book, \"Only the Rich Can Play: How Washington Works in the New Gilded Age,\" David Wessel, a Brookings economist and director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy, documents a clever tax-cut mechanism written into the law that escaped attention until recently.\n\nIn the latest episode of the \"Pitchfork Economics\" podcast, Wessel explains how so-called \"opportunity zones\" were created in the bill as a way to develop the economy in nearly 9,000 targeted areas around the country \u2014 but they really only served as a capital-gains tax cut for the super-rich.\n\nThe plan was relatively simple: Poor and underdeveloped locations around the country that could benefit from a massive influx of cash were identified as opportunity zones, and wealthy people and corporations could claim their investments in opportunity zones as a tax cut. The policy was slipped into the tax bill without much fanfare, and requirements for federal watchdogs to study and report on economic results of the opportunity zones plan were stripped from the bill before it passed.\n\n\"Once governors designated opportunity zones from a list of census tracts that the law made eligible, almost any investment in a property or business in a zone qualified,\" Wessel wrote in the New York Times, adding that \"one doesn't need to even assert that an investment will help the people who live in the zone.\"\n\nThanks to a recent investigation into 2019 tax records, a pair of enterprising economists provided a partial view of how nearly $19 billion in investments into opportunity zones worked out. The authors of the report, Patrick Kennedy and Harrison Wheeler, found that wealthy Americans and corporations only invested in about 16% of the existing opportunity zones. The majority of zones that received any funds were \"neighborhoods with pre-existing upward trends in population, income, and home values, and declining shares of elderly and nonwhite residents,\" Wheeler and Kennedy said.\n\nWessel said that recipients of opportunity-zone funds include \"a Ritz-Carlton hotel and condo complex in downtown Portland, Oregon, and a Virgin Hotel in New Orleans. Self-storage facilities, which create hardly any jobs, are sprouting with opportunity zone money. So is luxury student housing in university towns, which are eligible only because college kids show up as poor in census tallies.\"\n\nIn other words, the opportunity-zone program used the excuse of investing in thousands of low-income communities around the country, many of which happen to be nonwhite communities that have been ignored by politicians and business leaders for generations, to create a huge flow of untaxed money into a handful of mostly white, wealthy communities.\n\nIt's a damning reminder that even when trickle-down economics is explicitly written into the tax code as a feature and not a bug, the only people who benefit are the wealthy few, at the expense of everyone else.\n\nThe Trump tax cuts could serve as a watershed moment for trickle-down precisely because they prove the fallacy at the heart of the idea that rich people are the true job creators.\n\nFor the first time in 40 years, mainstream politicians are talking seriously about investing broadly in the American people through programs like affordable childcare, paid family leave, and worker-friendly laws like increased overtime thresholds and higher minimum wages.\n\nIf they follow through on their promises, they could finally upturn trickle-down's hold on the economy by proving that it's the consumer spending of working Americans \u2014 and not ridiculous, convoluted, free-market opportunity-zone schemes \u2014 that creates jobs and grows the economy from the middle out.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "If you live in Seattle, the prospect of a solar-powered electric car may not be that exciting, but enough people in sunnier places want to try the futuristic vehicle that automaker Lightyear has announced its second model. The Lightyear 2 is expected to enter production at the end of 2025 and go on sale with a starting price below $40,000.\n\nAccording to the company, the Lightyear 2 will halve the lifetime vehicle CO2 emissions compared to a traditional EV. The vehicle also promises 500 miles of range between charges, and the company says it has received 21,000 preorders from car-leasing and ride-sharing companies. Though the amount of solar-powered range was not shared specifically, the car will add several miles each day from its solar panels, the amount determined by the level of available sunlight.\n\nLightyear shared few other details, other than that the car will offer an impressive 0.175 drag coefficient, which will make it one of the slipperier cars around. The company did say its 500-mile estimate is based on how much sun would contribute to range during 15,000 miles of driving per year in Chicago.\n\nThe crossover-like 2 follows the insanely futuristic-looking Lightyear 0. That car features a range of 388 miles, and the company says its solar panels can add more than 6,800 miles per year. It also costs more than $263,000, so it\u2019s far from becoming a mainstream hit.\n\nLightyear announced that hopeful buyers could enter their information to get on the waitlist for the car, but a spokesperson told Autoblog that the waitlist is more of an email list to distribute information. Signing up gives priority when preorders and reservations do open, though, so it's probably best to sign up if you're at all interested.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t been paying close attention, it might seem like solar-powered EVs are coming out of nowhere, but there are at least a couple of other companies in the mix. The Sono Sion is a $25,000 solar EV that should begin production in Europe later this year. It offers a range of 190 miles and provides 5,700 miles of solar charging per year, or around 15 miles per day.\n\nStory continues\n\nAptera took a completely different approach than Lightyear and Sono, building a three-wheeled solar EV that looks like an airplane missing its wings. The funky car features up to a 1,000-mile range in the top model and can add up to 30 miles of range in a sunny location.\n\nSolar-powered EVs, like solar-powered homes, are somewhat at the mercy of the weather. The bulk of their range is gained like any other EV, through plugging in, but solar charging contributes. Most of the range numbers seen here are taken in sunny locations, such as Aptera\u2019s, which quotes Southern California as the region. Those of us living in less fantastic climates will see less of an impact from the solar panels, but any ability to charge for free should be welcomed.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Two years have passed since the turbulent elections of 2021, and the world is looking ahead to a major year in 2023. With the new US president entering the White House, some political trends may affect the outlook for the rest of the year. U.S.-China competition As China continues to strengthen its economy and expand its global reach, the US has made clear that it will seek to compete economically and militarily. The US takes a hard line against Chinese companies, banning several major Chinese tech firms from doing business in the United States. President Joe Biden has made it clear that he does not want to risk diplomatic or economic progress with Beijing, and instead advocates a strategy of \"hard, clear realism,\" including cooperation and competition. Biden's top security adviser, Jake Sullivan, has repeatedly pointed out that the United States must be \"wise and smart\" in dealing with China. Russia Turns to the West But in recent months, Russia has shown signs of a willingness to engage more directly with the West. Last December, Putin and Biden spoke by phone while discussing a meeting between Putin and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Putin and Biden may discuss a range of issues, including nuclear arms control, Ukraine, and the situation in the Arctic. If negotiations succeed, they could reduce tensions between the U.S. and Russia and open up possibilities for greater cooperation between the two countries. The Rise of Populism Populism is likely to remain the dominant trend in 2023. Populist parties have made progress in Europe in recent years, and their influence is expected to grow further in 2023. Populism's rise may also mean that issues such as migration and the refugee crisis will remain at the center of attention in 2023. In countries like Hungary, Italy, and Poland, populist parties are also growing, and could have a major impact on European politics in the coming years. Climate Change and the Green Agenda In 2021, the United States rejoined the Paris Agreement, a global agreement aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the effects of global warming. The Biden administration has taken steps to reduce emissions and pledged to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. In Asia, Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for a \"green revolution\" in the country and set a goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. Countries around the world are also expected to adopt ambitious policies to promote renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. The coronavirus pandemic Finally, this year's coronavirus pandemic may still be a major factor in global politics. In 2021, with the introduction of vaccines and improved treatments, the world is beginning to see progress in the fight against Covid-19. However, the virus continues to spread rapidly in many parts of the world, especially in developing countries with weaker health systems. Vaccine production and distribution is also slow, and rich countries are often undersupply. As the world responds to the epidemic, 2023 could be an important year. Many countries may focus on rebuilding their economies while dealing with other political trends mentioned above.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "The huge omnibus spending bill that was unveiled Tuesday contains an important series of provisions to help Americans save more. Buried in the 4,100 page bill is the \"Secure 2.0\" plan which would, among other things, require employers to automatically enroll employees in their 401(k) plan at a rate of least 3% but not more than 10% of their salary. Businesses with 10 or fewer employees or in business less than three years would be excluded. Doesn't sound like much, but it's a potentially important leap in helping overcome the retirement crisis. You can thank a University of Chicago professor, Richard Thaler, for helping popularize the idea. Thaler is one of the founding fathers of behavioral economics, which studies how people really behave, not how they are supposed to behave. One of those insights is that humans tend not to take action when they should: there is a lot of \"inertia\" in human decisions. Thaler designed many \"nudges\" that helped spur people to do things beneficial to them. Like saving more money for retirement. Thaler's 'nudge' Employer-sponsored 401(k) plans have been around since the late 1970s, but a lot of workers don't sign up for them, even when employers offer matching contributions. Not signing up made little sense, except if you understood that humans often don't act in their own self-interest. Thaler's \"nudge,\" which he suggested some 20 years ago, was automatic enrollment: employees are automatically enrolled in the program, unless they opt out. Congress built on that suggestion: the Pension Protection Act of 2006 encouraged employers to adopt automatic enrollment plans. It caught on, and many companies adopted the idea. Enrollment went way up. Today, about 6 in 10 employers offer automatic enrollment. A 2021 Vanguard study found that 91% of new hires stay in the plan when enrollment is automatic, compared with 28% at firms where contributions are voluntary. They also tend to increase contributions over time. The Secure 2.0 bill further codifies that practice into law. Americans don't save enough for retirement Remember the old \"three legged stool\" for retirement: personal savings, a pension and Social Security. That's mostly gone. Few young Americans have pensions. The average Social Security is check is $1,400 a month, not enough to get by for most people. That leaves personal savings. We need more \"nudges\" to get people to save more. The Secure 2.0 provisions would also create bigger \"catch-up\" contributions for older workers, allowing workers to put away an extra $10,000 a year once they are over 50 (the current limit is $6,500). It would also increase the age when Required Minimum Distributions would start, first to 73 from the current 72, and then 75 in 2033. Thank you, Richard Thaler Thaler won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2017 for his contributions to understanding human behavior. He has spent a lifetime studying irrational behavior, but when he won the Nobel Prize he joked that he intended to spend the prize money \"as irrationally as possible.\" There's a man who not only understands people, he understands himself.", "label": "human"}

More Information The information related to the JetBlue Plus Card has been collected by Business Insider and has not been reviewed by the issuer.\n\n40,000 bonus points after spending $1,000 on purchases and paying the annual fee in full within the first 90 days from account opening\n\n6X points on eligible JetBlue purchases\n\n2X points at restaurants and grocery stores\n\n1X points on all other purchases\n\n5,000 bonus points every year after your account anniversary\n\nMosaic benefits after spending $50,000 or more on purchases each calendar year with your card\n\nAnnual $100 statement credit after purchasing a JetBlue Vacations package of $100 or more with your JetBlue Plus Card\n\n50% inflight savings on cocktails and food purchases\n\nFree first checked bag for you and up to 3 companions on the same reservation when you use your JetBlue Plus Card to purchase tickets\n\nNo foreign transaction fees\n\nThe Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae is currently offering 60,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening.\n\nCardholders earn 5x total Chase Ultimate Rewards points on air travel and 10x total points on hotels and car rentals purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards\u00ae (after earning the $300 travel credit) and 3x points on other travel and dining. You can use the points to book travel directly through Chase, or transfer them to airline and hotel partners like United, Southwest, JetBlue, and Hyatt.\n\nChase's definition of \"travel\" is broad. You'll earn 3x points per dollar spent (outside of Chase Ultimate Rewards\u00ae) on flights, hotels, tolls, parking garages, taxis, and rideshare services like Uber and Lyft. Plus, you'll earn 3x points on dining, including takeout and delivery. These are all popular spending categories for New Yorkers.\n\nCardholders can also activate two years of complimentary Lyft Pink All Access membership (usually $199 per year), plus get 50% off their third year of membership.\n\nThe Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae has an annual fee of $550, but you'll get up to $300 in annual travel credits that apply to most travel purchases, including rideshares, which offsets over half the fee.\n\nYou'll get other valuable benefits like primary car rental insurance and trip delay and cancellation insurance. I had this card when I lived in New York and found it worth keeping for the lucrative points earning alone.\n\nIn New York City, you'll likely find yourself on the MTA subway or a commuter train like Amtrak or NJ Transit at some point, if not daily. You can earn 3x Chase Ultimate Rewards points on every dollar spent on tickets with the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae card, because train rides are included within Chase's broad travel category.\n\nEven better, you can use the up to $300 annual travel credits from the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae toward a subway or commuter train pass or tickets, which helps to offset the card's annual fee. Plus, you'll earn bonus points for most other travel and for dining. It's a handy card to have when you purchase train tickets to move about the city.\n\nIf you're not sure you can make the most of the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae card's benefits, consider the Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card, with a $95 annual fee. It earns 2x Chase Ultimate Rewards points on travel (outside of purchases made through Chase Ultimate Rewards) and 3x points on dining. Either card is ideal to use in New York City.\n\nNew Yorkers like stopping into Duane Reade or other drugstores for quick essentials. With a drugstore around nearly every corner, it's convenient to pop in any time as most of them are open around the clock.\n\nThe Chase Freedom Flex\u2120 offers a $200 after spending $500 on purchases in the first three months from account opening, and earns 3% cash back on drugstore purchases with no cap, which can add up quickly if you spend a lot at drugstores. You'll also earn 3% cash back on dining at restaurants, including takeout and eligible food delivery services, 5% cash back in rotating quarterly bonus categories (up to $1,500 in combined purchases each quarter when you activate, then 1%) and travel booked through Chase, and 1% cash back on most purchases. That's strong earning potential for a card with no annual fee.\n\nThe cash back is actually earned in the form of Chase Ultimate Rewards points. With the Chase Freedom Flex\u2120, 1 point is worth 1 cent, but your points are potentially worth much more if you pair the Chase Freedom Flex\u2120 with another Chase Ultimate Rewards card, like the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae, Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card, or Ink Business Preferred\u00ae Credit Card.\n\nChase Ultimate Rewards points are worth 1.8 cents apiece, on average, based on Insider's points and miles valuations, but the return you'll get depends on the cards you have and how you redeem your points.\n\nNew York City's restaurant scene needs no introduction, and is enjoyed by residents and visitors alike. In fact, many New Yorkers eat out or get delivery more often than not, especially because there are dozens of unique restaurants in each neighborhood.\n\nThe American Express\u00ae Gold Card comes with a welcome bonus offer of 60,000 points after you spend at least $4,000 in your first 6 months of card membership. It's the best card to use for dining out, takeout, and food delivery in New York City because you'll earn 4 American Express Membership Rewards points per dollar spent. Plus, you'll get up to $120 in dining credits each year** that are easy for New Yorkers to use.\n\nAfter enrollment, you can use up to $10 in statement credits each month for purchases at Grubhub, Seamless, The Cheesecake Factory, Milk Bar, Goldbelly, Wine.com, and participating Shake Shack locations. Even if you don't like the restaurants on the list, most New Yorkers can make good use of Grubhub and Seamless delivery once per month when they're not dining at their favorite local restaurants. This helps to cover the card's $250 annual fee.\n\nIf city exploration is your favorite thing to do, consider the Capital One Savor Cash Rewards Credit Card and its solid intro bonus: Earn a one-time $300 cash bonus once you spend $3,000 on purchases within the first 3 months. It earns 4% cash back on entertainment purchases \u2014 a broad category that includes things like tickets to movie theaters, plays, sporting events, and concerts, as well as tourist attractions, dance clubs, and many other activities.\n\nPlus, the card now offers cardholders 10% cash back on Uber and Uber Eats purchases, and a complimentary Uber One membership (offer ends November 14, 2024).\n\nThere aren't a lot of cards that reward entertainment purchases. You'll also earn 4% cash back on dining, 2% cash back at grocery stores, and 1% cash back on all other purchases. The Capital One Savor Cash Rewards Credit Card comes with a $95 annual fee, but if you spend a lot in the bonus categories, you can easily cover it. Run the numbers and see if your entertainment spending is enough to make this card worthwhile.\n\nDelta is a good airline for New Yorkers because they have a domestic hub at LaGuardia and many international flights out of JFK. Amex offers several Delta credit cards, but most casual flyers will do well with the Delta SkyMiles\u00ae Gold American Express Card. Right now, the card is offering a welcome bonus of 40,000 bonus miles after you spend $2,000 in purchases on your new card in your first six months.\n\nWith it, you'll get a free first checked bag on Delta flights for yourself and up to eight companions traveling on the same reservation, Zone 1 Priority boarding, and a 20% discount on inflight purchases as a statement credit. Considering it costs $30 to check a bag each way, you can recover the card's annual fee of $0 intro for the first year, then $99, in a single trip traveling with friends or family.\n\nThe Delta SkyMiles\u00ae Gold American Express Card also earns 2x Delta miles on Delta purchases, at restaurants worldwide (including takeout and delivery in the U.S.), and at U.S. supermarkets, which are bonus categories most New Yorkers can appreciate.\n\nIf you prefer to fly out of Newark, chances are you'll find yourself on a United flight. In that case, the United\u2120 Explorer Card is the best credit card for United flyers, with a limited-time elevated welcome bonus offer of 60,000 bonus miles after you spend $3,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening.\n\nYou'll earn 2x miles on United purchases, dining (including eligible delivery services), and hotel stays. Cardholders also get a statement credit of up to $100 for Global Entry, TSA PreCheck, or NEXUS every four years.\n\nThe card also mimics lower-level elite status by providing a free first checked bag for you and one companion on the same reservation when you pay for your ticket with the card, priority boarding, 25% back as a statement credit for United inflight purchases, and two United Club passes each cardmember anniversary.\n\nAll combined, the card is easily worth its annual fee of $0 intro for the first year, then $95, especially if you make the most of its generous perks. It's also one of the rare cards that offer primary car rental insurance.\n\nFrequent United flyers should also consider the United Club\u2120 Infinite Card, which comes with United Club airport lounge membership, additional benefits, and a new limited-time bonus.\n\nAmerican Airlines offers plenty of flights out of their hubs at LaGuardia domestically and JFK for trans-Atlantic travel. With the Citi\u00ae / AAdvantage\u00ae Platinum Select\u00ae World Elite Mastercard\u00ae, you'll earn 2x miles per dollar spent on eligible American Airlines purchases, and at restaurants and gas stations.\n\nAlong with a welcome bonus offer of 50,000 American Airlines AAdvantage\u00ae bonus miles after spending $2,500 in purchases within the first 3 months of account opening, the card also gets you a free first checked bag on domestic American Airlines flights, as well as for up to four companions traveling on the same itinerary. That perk alone can cover the card's annual fee of $99, waived for first 12 months. You'll also get preferred boarding when you fly on American Airlines and a 25% discount on inflight food and beverage purchases. If you fly American Airlines a few times per year, this is the best credit card for American Airlines flights.\n\nFinally, there's New York's hometown airline, JetBlue, which occupies all of Terminal 5 at JFK airport. New Yorkers love flying JetBlue for its comfort, unlimited snacks, and welcoming atmosphere. If that describes you, you'll do well with the JetBlue Plus Card, which comes with a welcome bonus offer of 40,000 bonus points after spending $1,000 on purchases and paying the annual fee in full within the first 90 days from account opening.\n\nIt earns 6x points on JetBlue purchases, 2x points at restaurants and grocery stores, and 1 point per dollar everywhere else. You'll also receive 5,000 bonus points on your account anniversary each year. The JetBlue Plus Card also comes with a free first checked bag for you and up to three companions on the same reservation when you use the card to pay for your tickets, and 50% off inflight cocktails and food purchases.\n\nJetBlue points are worth, on average, 1.35 cents each according to Insider's points and miles valuations, which means the 5,000 anniversary bonus points are worth about $68 toward JetBlue flights each year. Between that and the first free checked bag benefit, the JetBlue Plus Card is easily worth its $99 annual fee if you like flying with JetBlue.\n\nHarlan Vaughn Harlan Vaughn is a travel expert who has written about credit cards, points and miles, and loyalty programs since 2012.

{"text": ".. Many people like the company and its innovative spirit and trend-determining products, but some still don't believe it can make a profit. This disagreement, coupled with the risk of technology stocks and the fall in Tesla's stock price, has left many investors feeling dizzy. In a recent blog post, Siegel said Tesla's share price decline was due to investor expectations that exceeded reality, an issue similar to Warren Buffett's investment in the 1990s. \"As early as the 1990s, Warren Buffett bought huge stakes in many U.S. companies,\" Siegel wrote. \"However, he had high expectations for these investments. The shares of the companies he acquired rose sharply, but did not come close to what the market expected him to price. Siegel believes that investors' ownership of Tesla is expected to become one of the most important and valuable companies in the world. Unfortunately, he thinks this would not have been possible without huge advances in Tesla's production capacity and technology. \"Without the prospect of Tesla becoming an Amazon, Microsoft or Apple in the automotive world, it's hard to see that stock maintain its current valuation level,\" Siegel wrote. That's not to say that Tesla is a bad stock, just that investors should manage their expectations and understand the company's future prospects more limited than what high valuations suggest. Many believe that the stock's high valuation reflects its irrational prosperity, not its business prospects. Indeed, several prominent analysts such as Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs have lowered their ratings for the company over the past year. However, there is a very real risk that the company may fail to meet investors' expectations, leading to long-term disappointing returns. As Siegel has made clear, it is important to keep these risks in mind when investing in Tesla shares.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Category: Provinces of Tasmania Five years ago, when Jaquay Boone moved to a small village in Ashville, North Carolina, she was fleeing economic hardship. During her time at university, she had accumulated thousands of dollars in debt on the job, which cost her mental health. \"I'm in a pretty dark place mentally because I feel like I always get into debt,\" Boone, 28, said. But living in the village changed all that. In the comfortable neighborhood of a picturesque little house, Boone was able to take back control of her finances and pay off her debts, which gave her the freedom to pursue her true passion: writing and art. \"Living in this small home changed my life, it made me have a home of my own and financially back on track. But that's much more than that. It's like I found a new family,\" says Boone. The small town of Ashville, known as Fireseed Haven, is part of a growing trend in intentional communities focused on creating a sense of connection and belonging. These communities are often located in rural areas, often based on shared values such as a commitment to sustainable living. At Fireseed Haven, 19 small houses ranging in size from 200 to 500 square feet are surrounded by a public garden with various edible plants. The village also has a communal kitchen, a pottery studio and a library. Boone moved into her small house in 2017, when she had paid off her debts and was preparing to start a new chapter in her life. Living in the village allowed her to save on rent and utility bills, giving her more freedom to pursue her creative passion. \"I was able to save money because I didn't have to pay traditional rent, utilities and all the other bills for living in a big house,\" says Boone. \"It gave me financial freedom to focus on writing and art.\" But the biggest benefit of living in the village is that she finds a sense of community there. Fireseed Haven is filled with artists, musicians and other creative people who love sustainability and make the world a better place. \"I found a home in the village, I found a family among the people who lived there. We had all kinds of conversations, shared meals, and supported each other during good times and bad,\" Boone said. The village has grown since Boone moved five years ago, and she now serves as a mentor to newcomers. She helps them learn about living in a small house and the village's commitment to sustainability. Boone said she was grateful for the community she found in turkey harbor, which has made her life even richer. \"Living in this small hometown is a huge blessing,\" says Boone, \"I'm so grateful for the family I found here and the opportunity to focus on my passions without being overwhelmed by debt.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The U.S. Congress set up a bipartisan January 6 Independent Committee to investigate the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. On Tuesday, the committee released an 845-page final report detailing what happened that day and the role of former President Donald Trump in it. Here are the 14 most compelling insights from the committee's findings: 1. All evidence of the insurgency &apos; s intention indicates that they attempted to stop certifying electoral votes: the Commission found that the intent of the insurgency was \" to interfere with the proceedings of Congress which took place on that date \" and, in particular, to undermine the certification of Joe Biden &apos; s candidature. Trump's speech to the crowd played a key role in energizing the group: The committee found that \"Trump's speech to the crowd on that day was an important factor in prompting action and violence from the masses.\" Trump issued a \"stand up\" order during the attack: The report found that during the attack, Trump instructed his supporters to \"stand up\" and \"go home\", rather than take further action in an attempt to block the vote's certification. Trump did not use all available options to protect the Capitol: The committee found that although Trump had access to all available resources, he chose not to use them. The president could have mobilized the National Guard or issued an executive order, but he did not do so. The rioters armed, organized and pre-planned their attacks: the Commission found that the rioters had a high level of organization and good armament and had planned their attacks in advance, they brought weapons, drew maps of the Capitol building and coordinated them through an online message board. 6. A concerted effort has been made to identify and target individual members of the Congress: the Commission found that the insurgents had drawn up lists of MPs who had been expelled from the Capitol, identified them by name, and they also possessed a map of the Capitol and a plan to find specific offices. 7. A few days before the attack, warnings were issued to the police about possible violence: the Commission found that on 6 January, Congressional Police received a warning from internal and external sources about possible violence, although the police did not take the necessary measures to prepare for the attack. 8. The Capitol remains vulnerable owing to poor security and planning: the Commission found that, on the day of the attack, the Capitol remained open and vulnerable due to inadequate security measures and improper planning by the Capitol Police. 9. The extent of the damage inside the Capitol was far greater than initially reported: the Commission found that the rioters had caused much more significant damage within the Capitol than originally reported, destroying paintings, historical artifacts and damaged offices. 10. Insurgencies were able to enter the Capitol in a variety of ways: The Commission found that they had access to the Capitol by various means, including widening the outer walls and fences, forcing windows and doors open, and crowds pushing through the front door. 11. The National Guard was called only hours after the beginning of the attack: the Commission found that, even if the National Guard had not been called until several hours after the start of the attack, the response would have been insufficient to contain the insurgency. 12. The level of violence in this attack was significantly higher than initially anticipated: the Commission found that it was far more violent than previously reported by insurgents who attacked officers, threw things and broke into the Capitol with force. 13. Intelligence agencies have failed to inform Congress of the danger they face: the Commission found that, although intelligence agencies were aware of the potential for violence in advance, they had not sufficiently warned Congress about the danger they faced. Trump's response was slower than that of other members of the government: The committee found that Trump responded to the attack more slowly than any other member of the government. He ended up issuing a statement calling for \"peace and legality,\" but it came hours after the attacks began. The report concludes that the attack was preventable and that the Government, including the President, did not take action.The report also states that \" this is not a false protest; it is a deliberate attack on our Government and the rule of law\".", "label": "machine"}

Due to administrative hurdles and potential public backlash, retailers may not end up offering the pill.\n\n\"The only way this has any impact is if brick-and-mortar pharmacies get on board, and I'm not optimistic the big chains most Americans rely on will become certified,\" Greer Donley, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh's School of Law, wrote in a tweet Tuesday.\n\nThe FDA implemented the regulatory change Tuesday night to allow retail pharmacies to dispense mifepristone to people with a prescription. Previously, doctors and mail-order pharmacies could provide the pill.\n\nThe Biden administration is working to expand access to abortion, after the US Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade last year, and as more states ban or restrict the procedure,\n\nAccording to the FDA's website, any pharmacy that dispenses mifepristone must be certified. The steps to become certified include being able to receive prescriber agreement forms by email and fax, being able to ship the abortion pill with a shipping service that provides tracking information, designating a representative to carry out the certification process, and ensuring that representative oversees compliance with the federal mifepristone Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program.\n\nInsider contacted seven major retail pharmacies to ask whether they plan to sell mifepristone. None of them said they would carry the pill.\n\nCVS, Walgreens, and Rite Aid said they were reviewing the FDA announcement. They declined to say when they may make a decision.\n\nWalmart, Kroger, and Albertsons, didn't respond to requests for comment. Costco declined to comment.\n\nStill, abortion-rights advocates are applauding the FDA's move.\n\n\"This change will empower patients who choose medication abortion to have the option of going to a pharmacy for immediate care rather than waiting for a mail order, if that is right for them,\" Dr. Iffath Abbasi Hoskins, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said in a statement.\n\nMarjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, condemned the move, saying President Joe Biden's administration \"has once again proved that it values abortion industry profits over women's safety and unborn children's lives.\"\n\n\"Abortion activists want to turn every post office and pharmacy into an abortion business, and the Biden FDA is a willing participant,\" Dannenfelser said in a statement.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Lucky girl syndrome is a phenomenon in which people (usually young women) tend to try to do too much to make up for the shortcomings and disadvantages they realize. This often leads to feeling overwhelmed, and in some cases even tired. The term was invented by medical experts in 2012 and has been a controversial topic in medicine and psychology ever since. Lucky Girl Syndrome is more than just a belief; it's a real mental disorder that can lead to serious psychological problems, leading to a lack of self-worth and a negative view of life. It's usually caused by low self-esteem and inherent incompetence. Symptoms of Lucky Girl Syndrome may vary from person to person, but are typically characterized by excessive stress and guilt, overthinking, lack of self-confidence, and delay. People with Lucky Girl Syndrome are often perfectionists who compare their performance against others in an unrealistic and unfair way. It's important to understand the signs of Lucky Girl Syndrome so that it can be addressed and treated before it develops into something more serious. The most common symptoms of Lucky Girl Syndrome are feelings of inferiority, feeling overwhelmed, exhausted, and excessive need for approval. The best way to manage the Lucky Girl syndrome is to practice self-care. This includes getting enough rest, eating a healthy diet, exercising and taking time off to relax. It's also important to try to identify the root cause of the syndrome and address it directly. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is particularly effective in helping individuals develop coping strategies and build confidence. Lucky girl syndrome can be a debilitating disease, but it can be managed with the right help and support. If you think that you or someone you know may have lucky girl syndrome, seek help from a medical or mental health professional. With the right treatment and support, you can overcome this disease and live a happy and fulfilling life.", "label": "machine"}

REUTERS/Alexander Ermochenko\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMAKIIVKA, Ukraine, Jan 3 (Reuters) - A Ukrainian missile strike on Jan. 1 against a vocational school in the Russian-controlled Donetsk region of Ukraine housing mobilised Russian troops has become one of the bloodiest incidents of Russia's nearly year-long war in Ukraine.\n\nWhat do we know, and what do we not know, about what happened?\n\nWHAT HAPPENED\n\nThe strike on Professional Technical School No. 19 in Makiivka, a twin city to the regional capital of Donetsk which has been controlled by Russian proxy forces since 2014, occurred at 0001 on New Year's Day, Daniil Bezsonov, a Russian-installed Donetsk official, said.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said Ukraine struck with six U.S.-made HIMARS rockets.\n\nThe governor of Russia's Samara region said that many of the dead soldiers were locals.\n\nUnconfirmed footage circulated on social media purportedly shows residents watching Russian President Vladimir Putin's midnight address before running for cover as missiles strike the ground nearby.\n\nReuters photographs from the scene show the ruined remains of the school.\n\nLOSSES\n\nReports of casualties vary. Reuters was unable to independently verify how many people were killed.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said on Monday that 63 soldiers had been killed in the strike, an assessment echoed by a source close to Donetsk's Russia-installed separatist leadership, who told Reuters that dozens had died.\n\nThe ministry acknowledged the attack only in the final paragraph of a 528-word daily roundup, more than 36 hours after the attack took place.\n\nRussia has consistently underplayed its casualty figures, including claiming that only one man died during the sinking of the battleship Moskva in April.\n\nUkraine has claimed a far higher casualty figure, saying that around 400 died. A number of Russian military bloggers, who have gained large followings through mixing pro-Kremlin advocacy with unvarnished information on the state of the front, have also given casualty figures closer to the Ukrainian number.\n\nIn a post on the Telegram messaging app, Igor Girkin, a former FSB officer instrumental in starting the initial 2014 war in the Donbas, said that there were \"many hundreds\" of killed and injured.\n\nGirkin said that ammunition and military equipment had been stored in the buildings, contributing to the strength of the blast. He blamed Russia's \"untrainable\" generals for the losses.\n\nGrey Zone, a Telegram channel linked to the Wagner mercenary outfit, said that around 500 men were billeted in the complex.\n\nIn footage circulated on social media and geolocated by Reuters, the vocational school, a large complex of Soviet-era buildings, appears virtually razed as emergency service workers sift through rubble.\n\nOUTCRY\n\nComing at the climax of the new year's celebrations, the most important holiday of the year in Russia, the attack has resonated within Russia.\n\nA report by state-owned news agency TASS, citing Donetsk officials, saying that Ukrainian forces were able to identify the target from soldiers using their Russian mobile phones has provoked anger among Russia's military blogger community.\n\n\"As expected, the blame for what happened in Makiivka began to be blamed on the mobilised soldiers themselves. You see, they turned on their phones and got spotted,\" wrote Grey Zone, a Telegram channel linked to the Wagner Group mercenary outfit.\n\nGrey Zone went on to blame commanders for lodging large numbers of soldiers in a building vulnerable to artillery fire.\n\nIn a post on Telegram, Sergei Mironov, leader of a Kremlin-loyal party in Russia's parliament, said that an investigation was necessary to determine whether \"treachery or criminal negligence\" was behind the strike.

{"text": "Tesla Inc. cut prices in China for the second time in less than three months on Tuesday as the U.S. electric vehicle maker struggles to stimulate demand in the world's largest auto market, while the economy slows and competition intensifys. In a statement, Tesla said that the price of its Model S and Model X was reduced by 12% to 26%, while the price of the Model 3 was reduced by 10%. The reduction only applies to vehicles manufactured at its new factory near Shanghai and sold in China. The move comes two weeks after the company announced that its first line in China will start production of the Model 3 from mid-December, and analysts said the move would help Tesla expand its market share in the country. Tesla's announcement on Tuesday marked the second round of price cuts since October, when the automaker cut prices for some Chinese models by 8 percent. The Palo Alto-based company faces fierce competition in China, with domestic and foreign electric vehicle manufacturers pouring in. To gain a competitive edge, Tesla cut prices for the Model S in October to attract Chinese consumers to use its luxury cars. However, China's auto market weakened this year as economic growth slowed and consumer confidence waned. In September, new car sales fell for the eighth straight month, with automaker sales down 11.3% from a year earlier. The decline in car sales has been a major concern for Tesla, which said last month it was considering lowering the price of some of its vehicles in the country due to stronger Chinese currency yuan. Tesla's move is part of its efforts to stay competitive in an increasingly crowded rival market. In recent months, several Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers have announced ambitious plans to expand their operations in the country. Last October, Shanghai-based electric vehicle startup Nio Inc launched its first mass-produced electric car and said it had sold 7,000 units in the previous three months. Meanwhile, Chinese automakers have been rolling out models to meet the country's growing demand for electric vehicles. BYD Co Ltd, one of the world's largest EV manufacturers, unveiled two new electric models at the Shanghai Auto Show in November aimed at taking advantage of government incentives for green cars. Tesla's move comes at a time when the company is struggling to become profitable as it accelerates production of its Model 3, which is by far the company's cheapest model. In October, the automaker reported more than expected losses in the third quarter, due to delays in production of the Model 3 and high spending related to the launch of cars in new markets. Despite the price cut, Tesla's fate in China remains uncertain. Analysts say it may take some time for the company to regain momentum in the Chinese market, given increased competition and weak consumer confidence. \"Tesla's production expansion in China will help the company expand its market, but a strong presence of local and foreign competitors could put pressure on Tesla to stay price competitive and attract Chinese buyers,\" said Jennifer Chen, an analyst at consultancy Frost & Sullivan.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".. The Tesla driver was accused of deliberately dropping his family off a cliff in California. On Friday, January 3, California Highway Patrol (CHP) arrested the driver of a Tesla car for deliberately driving his family out of the cliff. All passengers, including the driver, were found dead at the crash site. The tragic incident took place near the Pacific Coast Highway in Westport, California. At around 11 p.m. on Thursday, witnesses reported seeing a white Tesla sedan flying toward the cliff. CHP reported that the car did not slow down and crashed on the edge of the cliff. The car then slipped off the cliff and crashed into the Pacific Ocean. Eyewitnesses were able to observe the vehicle's fall and alert authorities. The People's Party, together with local and federal authorities, deployed air and water vessels to search for survivors. After a thorough investigation, all the bodies, including the driver, were found from the wreckage. The 39-year-old driver, Jonathan Armstead, died of severe physical injuries and drowning. All three passengers in the car, his wife and two children, were declared dead at the scene. All four were confirmed by DNA tests and fingerprints. CHP conducted an extensive investigation into the cause of the accident, and after thoroughly examining the vehicle's system and other data, authorities determined that Tesla was deliberately driven off the cliff. Based on their findings, CHP has charged Jonathan Armstead with four counts of manslaughter and one count of reckless driving. The tragic incident left Westport's community in trouble. John Smith, a neighbor and family friend, spoke to reporters on Friday: It was heartbreaking. The Armsteads were a good family, and it was so tragic that I couldn't even express it in words. Jonathan Armstead's family issued a statement expressing their grief and shock over the incident. They went on to say that Jonathan had been struggling with depression for some time, and his family had been trying to get help from him. The cause of Jonathan Armstead's depression has not been revealed, and the family asked for privacy when they were sad. The incident is still under investigation, and authorities have asked anyone with information on the case to come forward. It was a terrible tragedy, and the thoughts and prayers of the entire community were with the Armstead family.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "It's no secret that the internet has been a major driver of economic growth for the past 15 years. But, after a turbulent 2020 and 2021, the future of the Internet remains uncertain. Mahani is the Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst at RBC Capital Markets, recognized as one of the world's top internet and digital media analysts. He has been responsible for analysing some of the most well-known Internet companies such as Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Apple. Mahani noted that one of the biggest trends in the Internet industry is moving away from traditional desktop use to mobile devices. He believes this will lead to higher usage and engagement, creating opportunities for internet stocks to perform in 2023 and beyond. Mahani's biggest return to Internet stocks in 2023 is Amazon. He believes that the continued development of online shopping and cloud computing will drive Amazon's revenue growth. Moreover, he thinks Amazon has the ability to take advantage of the growing demand for streaming content, especially with its popular streaming service Twitch. Another option for Mahani is Facebook, the world's largest social media platform, which he expects will continue to benefit from its large user base and huge interpersonal capabilities. He also believes that its advantages in areas such as augmented reality and virtual reality will help the company stay ahead of the Internet. Google is also one of Mahani's top Internet stocks list for 2023. He believes that Google's dominance in search and ownership of YouTube will enable it to take advantage of emerging trends such as streaming video, artificial intelligence and voice devices. According to Mahani, Apple is also one of the top Internet stock picks for 2023. He believes that the company's strong presence in the mobile device market and its ability to take advantage of its vast ecosystem will be the driving force behind the industry. In addition to these major players, Mahani believes that streaming services like Spotify and Netflix, as well as Chinese Internet giants such as Baidu and Tencent, will be the main competitors in the market. He believes that streaming services will particularly benefit from their ability to provide consumers with customized, tailored content. Finally, Mahani believes that companies like Etsy and Uber could be the main beneficiaries of a shift to digital payment services in 2023. He is particularly optimistic about Uber's prospects, noting its presence in numerous markets and its potential to benefit from consumers' embrace of digital services. Although these stocks have the potential to perform well in 2023, Mahani warns investors to do their own due diligence before investing. While he believes that these stocks have great potential for strong returns, markets are always unpredictable and investors should ensure they fully understand the risks before investing. From industry giants to emerging companies, each of these stocks is well positioned to take advantage of current trends and capitalize on the future of the Internet. Investors should keep a close eye on these stocks and monitor their performance in 2023, as they may be key to a successful portfolio.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The Landing. The National Football League (NFL) announced Saturday that the Cincinnati Bengal team will face the Baltimore Raptors at 1 p.m. on Sunday, December 27. This decision comes six days after Bangladesh defender Damal Hamlin participated in an emergency landing of a private jet. News of the match time was announced after Bangladesh defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars 27-17 on Sunday. Bengal manager Zac Taylor said the team had discussed the possibility of adjusting their schedule within a week due to Hamlin's situation, and hoped to wait until the league made a decision on the timing of the game to move forward. \"We think it's important to respect Damar and make sure we do things the right way to ensure he has more time to recover from the incident,\" Taylor said in a statement. \"Ultimately, the league decided to postpone our game until 1 p.m. We are ready to enter the stadium and honor Damar.\" Hamlin, who was a passenger on a private plane during an emergency landing in South Dakota on December 21, was later hospitalized after the accident. Details of the emergency landing are not yet known, but a statement issued by Hamlin's agents states that he suffered only minor injuries and is expected to make a full recovery. In response to the news of an emergency landing, both Bangladesh and Ravens cancelled their drills last week. Both Bengal boss Mike Brown and Ravens coach John Hubbard called for prayers for Hamlin and his family, and both teams paid tribute to safety in their respective games this weekend. The match between Bangalore and Ravens will be the team's first face-to-face game of the season.The two teams have not faced each other since the 2018 season, when Bangladesh won the playoff by 24-14. Bangladesh, which currently holds a record of 5-9-1, ranks third in the AFC Northern League, behind only 10-5 Ravens and 10-5 Cleveland Browns. Bangladesh will seek its second consecutive victory after beating the Jaguars on Sunday. This week's game is Bangalore and Lavinth's last regular season, with both teams hoping to finish the season strong and make a deep final impression. The match will be aired on ET at 1 p.m. in Fox, which should be a good way to end the NFL season.", "label": "machine"}

The two chefs are originally from France and met while studying at one of France's best culinary schools, \u00c9cole Gr\u00e9goire-Ferrandi in Paris.\n\nTogether with their line cook Andrew Tu and apprentice Maxime Olszanski, the pair run the kitchen, while ma\u00eetre d' Jerome Bougherdani, who is also from France, greets diners at the front.\n\nBoullay came to New York after he was the only student in his class to volunteer when chefs from Le District, New York City's French food hall, visited, looking for cooks and apprentices to come to the US.\n\nWhile no two days at L'Appart are exactly alike, Boullay and Douay talked to Insider about what a day in their lives looks like leading the restaurant together.\n\n11 a.m. - Start preparing for evening service\n\nBoullay and Douay wake up around 9:30 a.m. and arrive at the restaurant around 11 a.m. or 12 p.m.\n\n\"The way you break down your day, you're going to start with the longest things to do,\" Boullay said. \"Then after, you do the little things with details.\"\n\nBoth chefs start the day preparing produce, cutting the meats and fish, and cleaning out the dishwasher for evening service which begins at 5 p.m.\n\nOn Tuesdays, the restaurant receives most of its orders of produce for the week.\n\nMost of the food the restaurant uses is local, with vegetables from New Jersey or the Union Square Farmers Market, and fish and meat from the US.

Fridays and Saturdays are the busiest nights.\n\nL'Appart offers a 5-course tasting menu that changes every four weeks depending on what produce is in season. The current menu includes dishes like Royal Ossetra Caviar and live diver scallops.\n\nBy having a limited menu, the chefs said they are able to keep food waste low.\n\n\"As a fine dining restaurant, we try to offer the best experience to our customers,\" Boullay said. \"Because the menu is renewed every four weeks, we have to renew ourselves a lot.\"\n\nDepending on how quickly or slowly people eat, the chefs may have to rush to make and serve each course.\n\n\"It's a kind of game you need to play every night,\" he said.\n\nL'Appart is an open kitchen, so diners can watch the chefs prepare their meals.

{"text": "Pennsylvania Democratic Senator Bob Casey was diagnosed with prostate cancer on Wednesday, his office announced. The 53-year-old senator's office said in a statement that the cancer was detected early and he is expected to make a full recovery without additional treatment, adding that Casey's primary care physician recommended routine medical checks, which resulted in a diagnosis. Cayce, who was first elected to the Senate in 2006, is expected to continue his normal routine at the Senate and participate in committee hearings and other events. \"Senator Casey remains optimistic about his predictions and is grateful for the early findings,\" the statement said, adding: \"It is expected that he will fully recover without additional treatment or intervention and continue to serve Pennsylvanians in the U.S. Senate.\" Casey is the latest in a series of lawmakers on Capitol Hill who have been diagnosed with some type of cancer in recent years. In September 2019, then-presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders was diagnosed with prostate cancer, but he has since declared that he does not have cancer. Senators John McCain of Arizona and Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, both deceased, were diagnosed with brain cancer while in the Senate. A statement from Casey's office said he remains committed to his work in the Senate and addresses the concerns of the people of Pennsylvania. \"Senator Casey remains committed to serving Pennsylvanians and working with colleagues in the Senate to continue addressing many of the issues affecting middle-class families in the Commonwealth,\" it said. In a statement Wednesday, Pat Toomey, another Republican senator from Pennsylvania, said he hoped his colleagues would recover quickly. \"I join all Pennsylvaniaers in wishing Bob and his family well for the days ahead,\" Tummy said. \"We are all praying for a full recovery, and I have no doubt that he will overcome this cancer with the same determination and resilience he has shown in public life.\" Casey is not the only Pennsylvania lawmaker facing health issues in recent months. Rep. Mike Doyle, a Democrat from Pittsburgh, announced in September that he had been diagnosed with throat cancer but said it was in its early stages and was receiving radiation therapy. Casey is the second senator from Pennsylvania to have been diagnosed with cancer in the past five years. Former Senator Alan Spector, who served from 1981 to 2011, announced in August 2008 that he was struggling with Hodgkin's lymphoma, although he successfully completed treatment and remained in the Senate until his retirement in 2011. Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in men, with an estimated 175,000 new cases diagnosed in the United States in 2019, according to the American Cancer Society. The organization says it can be effectively treated if this disease is detected early. Casey's office said he would be under regular surveillance and hoped to make a full recovery without further treatment. He is expected to continue representing Pennsylvania in the Senate.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The U.S. and other world leaders issued a joint declaration Wednesday condemning Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and denouncing threats of using nuclear weapons, an intimidation tactic that\u2019s become commonplace for Russian President Vladimir Putin since launching his invasion nine months ago.\n\n\u201cThe use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible,\u201d read the statement, composed by the world\u2019s 20 largest economies. \u201cThe peaceful resolution of conflicts, efforts to address crises, as well as diplomacy and dialogue, are vital. Today\u2019s era must not be of war.\u201d\n\nThe 17-page document marks a victory for the Biden Administration and global allies, which sought to end this year\u2019s summit in Bali, Indonesia with a statement censuring Russia for its unprovoked military campaign in Ukraine. In recent weeks, the Biden team has launched a discreet, multi-pronged effort to pressure Moscow to dial back the increasingly reckless bluster that has sparked fears the world was nearing the brink of nuclear war. Through a series of one-on-one discussions and back channels between top U.S. and Russian officials, combined with diplomatic maneuvering with other nations\u2019 leaders, the Administration has worked to get Putin and his government to stop threatening the use of nuclear weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine, where Moscow has faced mounting losses this fall.\n\nIn a rare disclosure on Monday, the White House revealed CIA Director William Burns met with his Russian counterpart Sergey Naryshkin in Ankara, Turkey\u2019s capital, to discuss potential costs to the Kremlin if it decides to use a nuclear weapon in the Ukraine conflict. \u201cHe is not conducting negotiations of any kind,\u201d a White House spokeswoman said. \u201cHe is conveying a message on the consequences of the use of nuclear weapons by Russia, and the risks of escalation to strategic stability.\u201d\n\nThe same day, President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping issued a joint-statement that said nuclear weapons should never be used, particularly in Ukraine. The rebuke was noteworthy considering Beijing has tacitly approved of Putin\u2019s actions and shown reticence to join the international community\u2019s widespread condemnation of invasion.\n\nRead more: U.S. Unveils Strategy for Nuclear Threats from China and Russia\n\nThe message the U.S. seeks to send is clear: if Moscow goes nuclear in Ukraine, it will only experience further economic and diplomatic isolation on the world stage. There are indications that the strategy, which has gathered momentum behind the scenes since late September after Putin illegally annexed four occupied regions of Ukraine then suggested he\u2019d defend the territory with nuclear arms, may be working. Putin backtracked late last month by stating Russia would gain nothing through launching a nuclear strike. \u201cWe see no need for that,\u201d he said Oct. 27 at a conference of international foreign policy experts. \u201cThere is no point in that, neither political nor military.\u201d\n\nConcerned observers are cautiously optimistic that the U.S. approach will continue to draw Putin away from the nuclear threshold, but they worry about the ongoing instability of relations between the world\u2019s foremost nuclear powers. \u201cThe Biden team has been effective in cautioning Putin not to cross the nuclear line, warning of the consequences, and quietly encouraging others with influence like China to provide similar messages to Putin. They\u2019ve done this very adeptly while avoiding provocations,\u201d says Lynn Rusten, vice president at the Nuclear Threat Initiative and former senior official on arms control and nonproliferation issues at the White House and State Department. \u201cBut they must stay vigilant. The crisis may have passed, but the risk of nuclear use will remain as the war grinds on.\u201d\n\nAll of Putin\u2019s threats have thus far appeared to be primarily for show\u2014U.S. intelligence has yet to observe changes in the posture of Russia\u2019s strategic arsenal\u2014but the prospect of the world\u2019s most powerful weapon being detonated cannot be disregarded. Biden has sought to avoid nuclear escalation with Russia ever since the first chaotic days of the war. Around 90% of the world\u2019s nuclear warheads belong to Russia and the United States, and these arsenals loom large over U.S. strategy posture as the Biden seeks to keep pressure on Putin to stop his blood-soaked military campaign.\n\nThe Administration has sought to strike a balance between supporting Ukraine with weapons and intelligence information without sparking nuclear escalation or an open war with Russia. The Biden team has been forced to adapt the strategy at nearly every turn in the conflict and determine how far the U.S. can go without crossing Putin\u2019s red lines.\n\nIn March, the Biden Administration postponed a long-planned military test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile out of fears that Russia would see it as threatening. A week later, the U.S. rejected a proposal to provide the Ukrainian Air Force with 28 MiG-29 fighter jets for similar reasons. The President dismissed calls to establish a no-fly zone in the skies above Ukraine because it would bring American pilots in direct combat with Russian pilots. And throughout the war, Biden has restrained from engaging in tit-for-tat nuclear threats in response to Putin\u2019s rhetoric.\n\nRead More: Inside the $100 Billion Mission to Modernize America\u2019s Aging Nuclear Missiles\n\nInstead, Biden\u2019s National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has privately relayed to Russian officials the potential consequences for launching a nuclear strike in Ukraine. In public, the Administration has refused to detail what penalties Russia would face for using a nuclear weapon\u2014a catastrophe that hasn\u2019t occurred since the U.S. dropped two atomic bombs on Japan in 1945.\n\nExpressing these messages in private while outwardly harnessing a coalition of nations to denounce Russia\u2019s potential nuclear use is proving to be an effective strategy thus far, says George Perkovich, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington non-profit. \u201cBut it\u2019s still early,\u201d he says. \u201cUnfortunately, we\u2019re not at a point where the risk of Russia using nuclear weapons is zero.\u201d\n\nOver the last several months, the Russian military has suffered a series of embarrassing defeats in Ukraine and late last week withdrew from the region west of the Dnipro River. If Putin\u2019s forces continue to be bogged down fighting a smaller, less capable Ukrainian army, many experts fear the danger of a wider, more calamitous confrontation with the West will rise. But the winter weather is expected to pause fighting, which may provide an opening for peace talks between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nThe return of nuclear brinkmanship on the global stage has reminded the world of the Cuban missile crisis, which is the last time the superpowers neared nuclear war. The showdown, now 60 years ago, did not develop into a shooting war or a nuclear exchange. Can we once again avert such a disaster and come upon a diplomatic resolution? Such an ending seems remote amid Russia\u2019s daily bombardment of Ukrainian cities and the mass violence there. But to survive the current conflict, the lessons of the past must be reexamined.\n\nAt the end of the Cuban missile crisis, the U.S. and Soviet Union opened numerous communication channels, and established several treaties around nuclear weapons and other issues of mutual concern through prolonged diplomacy\u2014despite being sworn adversaries. \u201cThe road we\u2019re on now is long and has a lot of curves ahead,\u201d Perkovich says. \u201cSo I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll get there, but we should at least try.\u201d\n\nWrite to W.J.

{"text": ".. On Tuesday, November 23, the Trump family became the first family in modern U.S. history to pass the $10 billion net asset mark, largely due to investments, real estate deals and lucrative business deals with Donald Trump Jr. The Trump family, once a microcosm of luxury living, now has an estimated wealth of about $10.1 billion. While Donald and Melania Trump's total wealth is around $2 billion, the rest of the family have become very wealthy through investments, real estate transactions, and business dealings. The former president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., contributed the most to his wealth. After inheriting a $100 million estate from his father in 2017, the 41-year-old son expanded his fortune by investing in real estate in the Caribbean, selling his stake in Montana farms and closing deals with siblings. In August 2020, Donald Jr. sold his stake in the Elkhorn Ranch in Montana to his siblings for about $26 million. He initially bought a stake in the ranch for just $1.4 million, making it his most successful real estate deal to date. Meanwhile, young sister Ivanka Trump has accumulated nearly $1.2 billion in wealth through successful real estate ventures and investments in her own fashion brand Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry. In 2014, Ivanka sold her home in Hampton for $15 million and bought a top-story apartment on Trump Park Avenue in Manhattan, valued at an estimated $5.5 million. She also invested in real estate in the Caribbean and built connections with many successful business ventures. The youngest of Trump's siblings, Eric and Tiffany, have also been successful in business. Eric is the managing director of the Trump International Golf Club, which recently opened a range of restaurants and bars in Florida. Meanwhile, Tiffany has had an emerging career in fashion, working with Andrew Warren and Katie El Milio on the costume series \"Andrew Warren Tiffany Trump.\" The Trump family's wealth is further supported by a $11 million beachfront estate in the city of St. Martin and a $15 million fleet of private jets. They also own many luxury cars, including Rolls Royce, Maserati, and Bentley. Despite the Trump family's overwhelming wealth, its modest and family-centered lifestyle is well known. According to Michael D'Antonio, a biographer of the Trump family, the Trump family's generosity extends to their families and strangers. \"When the Trump family travels, they often bring special treatment to their children. They also find ways to donate to large and small charities,\" D'Antonio said. The Eric Trump Foundation, founded in 2006, raised millions of dollars for St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital. Ivanka is also committed to charity, advocating for issues such as equal pay for equal work and the empowerment of women. Much of the Trump family's incredible wealth is due to their smart business decisions, real estate transactions, and investments. With their fortune estimated at more than $10 billion, it's clear that the Trump family has come a long way since Donald Trump began commercial deals in the 1970s.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "For nearly three decades, music fans have celebrated and vigorously defended singer Morrissey and his unique backpunk and alternative rock mix. But today, the beloved icon has a heated debate with Congressional Records, one of the world's largest record labels, over his musical rights. Later last week, Morrissey posted a statement on his website announcing that he was breaking away from Universal Music Group's stamped Congress Building due to \"the bureaucracy and limitations of modern record labels.\" \"The Capitol has absolutely no incentive to fight for a brilliant new record, and that's the core reason I have to leave,\" he said. The label countered, issuing its own statement accusing the singer of turning away from a multi-year deal with him and downplaying efforts by Congress to push for his release. \"Morris' request is shockingly unrealistic and groundless in reality,\" the statement said. The ongoing battle has sparked turmoil in the music world, with Morrissey's fans supporting their icons through social media and industry insiders to discuss the merits of artists' demands versus label positions. At the heart of the Morrissey controversy is a conflict with the brand's latest signing: pop star Miley Cyrus. The British musician accused the label of prioritizing Cyrus over him, claiming that Congress had focused its propaganda efforts on her album released earlier this month at the expense of his latest release. \"What Congressional Records management didn't realize was that they wouldn't invest in the Morrissey record,\" he said in a statement. \"If you don't believe in art, you can't buy it.\" The controversy sparked riots in the music industry, with many artists and industry figures expressing their support for Morrissey on Twitter and other platforms. \"Morris is a true artist and his vision should not be compromised,\" alternative rock artist Jade Bird wrote on Twitter. Others denounced their decision that the label would prioritize pop music stars like Cyrus over respected music legends. \"It's a shame that the label chose to prioritize Millie's record rather than properly promoting Morrissey's music,\" one tweet read. Others pointed out that the brand's decision to invest in the latest Cyrus album instead of Morrissey's can be seen as a reflection of the industry's broader shift toward pop rock. Over the past decade, rock music has steadily lost ground on global charts, which have become an increasingly powerful force in the industry. Despite this, many still consider the music that Morrissey has been making for the past three decades to be worthy of recognition and praise. While the quarrel continues to draw attention, many industry experts predict that Morrissey will eventually find a new brand to sign. But for now, the singer is firmly opposed to the Capitol and has vowed to continue making new music in his own way. \"My artistic integrity remains intact,\" Morrissey said in a statement. \"I'm still self-blaming.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Kevin McCarthy\u2019s humiliation, and that of Donald Trump alongside him, offers a tall draft of schadenfreude. At the end of that, though, the nation is left with an empty glass and a bitter taste.\n\nFor many reasons, McCarthy is unfit for the speakership: He undermined the 2020 election, he is dishonest, he is (as we see) unable to marshal his caucus. But his defectors aren\u2019t really interested in a speaker who is able to keep the House organized or functional. Their ability to hold Congress hostage is a flashing red light for the country.\n\nOne can draw some very general conclusions about the anti-McCarthy clique: Its members are mostly far to the right, and they are mostly very pro-Trump, notwithstanding their disagreement on this issue with Trump, who supports McCarthy. All but two of them are election deniers, The Washington Post noted.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Kevin McCarthy\u2019s loyalty to Trump got him nothing\n\nBut the dispute in place here is not fundamentally ideological, as Jonathan Chait writes, or at least not in traditional terms. This isn\u2019t a simple question of conservative versus moderate. If it were, Marjorie Taylor Greene wouldn\u2019t be one of McCarthy\u2019s most fiery defenders in this battle. Rather, the divide is about whether the House should be able to accomplish anything at all, and whether the GOP caucus will be bound by political reality. Greene\u2019s presence on the McCarthy side indicates that she has a more realistic theory of governance and power, which says a lot about her counterparts here.\n\nToday, in nominating McCarthy on the fourth round of balloting, Representative Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin said, \u201cThere are things I want that I know are impossible to get done in this Congress,\u201d but argued that McCarthy was best-positioned to achieve what was possible. But the rebels start from a premise that nothing is impossible if they\u2019re simply dedicated enough to the cause. They believe they can wrestle the Senate and the White House into submission through force of will. The changes they seek might effectively prevent the House from doing anything, but they don\u2019t see that as a problem; stasis and refusal are tools of hard-core conservatism in their hands.\n\nMcCarthy is not an ideologue. He is, at heart, a transactional politician who thrives on relationships. When the rebels rise in the chamber and aver that their disagreement with McCarthy is not personal, they can be both sincere and at the same time spurning him in sharply personal terms, because that is what he is. He has already tried to win them over by offering concessions on some demands, including the number of representatives needed for a motion to vacate, which could force a vote on ejecting the speaker at any time. (It would also gut ethics investigations.) These concessions would make McCarthy a weak speaker if he were able to win the chair, which it appears he cannot. Watching McCarthy try to bargain with them has been darkly humorous, because dealing is in McCarthy\u2019s blood but they are fundamentally anti-deal, whether with Democrats or with him. That is, in fact, their core precept.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the Republican caucus sided with McCarthy, at least at the start of this process. But this is not to say that the rest of the GOP is innocent of the rebels\u2019 kind of thinking. Since 2011, congressional Republicans as a whole have slumped toward the belief that simply sticking to their guns is enough. Much like Donald Trump, the rebels are both continuous with recent trends in the Republican Party but also a break from them, in terms of their zealotry.\n\nRead: The humiliation of Kevin McCarthy\n\nNo example is more clear than the debt ceiling, an odd, vestigial limit on the nation\u2019s borrowing power. It doesn\u2019t actually affect spending; Congress decides what to spend and then has to pay for that (or borrow), regardless of where the debt limit is set. Refusing to borrow to pay that debt would simply put the nation in default. But Republicans\u2014including McCarthy\u2014have repeatedly voted against raising the debt ceiling anyway, claiming that that would somehow constrain spending, or tried to use it as a backdoor method to enact massive spending cuts.\n\nThe debt ceiling is one reason the outcome of this speaker vote matters: The new Congress will have to raise the debt limit or else produce a default sometime in the next few months. McCarthy has been unable to satisfy either the rebels, who want no surrender, or his moderates, who want no part of an economic catastrophe. \u201cIs he willing to shut the government down rather than raise the debt ceiling?\u201d Representative Ralph Norman of South Carolina, one rebel, said today. \u201cThat\u2019s a nonnegotiable item.\u201d\n\nBut whatever McCarthy\u2019s particular weaknesses, any speaker will face the same quandary. That might be true even of legislators with better conservative bona fides, such as current House Majority Whip Steve Scalise; at least one McCarthy dissident said he wouldn\u2019t vote for anyone who\u2019d been in leadership for the past decade. Whether McCarthy or someone else, the next speaker will not only need 218 votes; he or she will also need a miracle.", "label": "human"}

Hoewel het belangrijk is om te leren hoe je je piekergedrag in een moderne wereld \u201cafzwakt\u201d, zegt ze, is het goed te beseffen dat bezorgdheid ook een normale menselijke emotie is die is bedoeld om ons te helpen.\n\nIn haar boek \u2018Good Anxiety\u2018 onderzoekt Suzuki, een hoogleraar neurowetenschap aan de New York University, hoe we bezorgdheid in ons eigen voordeel kunnen gebruiken. Volgens haar kan het anders denken over bezorgdheid ons helpen productiever en empathischer te worden.\n\nJe zorgen maken is een natuurlijke emotie die je niet helemaal kunt \u2018uitzetten\u2019\n\nWanneer je bezorgd bent wordt het sympathische zenuwstelsel in je lichaam geactiveerd, waardoor je hartslag stijgt, je ademhaling toeneemt, en je bloed wegtrekt uit je spijsverterings- en voortplantingsorganen, zegt Suzuki.\n\nHoewel dit nuttig kan zijn in gevaarlijke situaties, kunnen permanente zorgen ook slecht zijn voor je lichaam. Langdurig piekergedrag kan het risico op hart- en vaatziekten verhogen, leiden tot aandoeningen zoals depressie, en zelfs vruchtbaarheidsproblemen veroorzaken, aldus de hoogleraar.\n\nLichaamsbeweging kan helpen tegen bezorgdheid door dopamine, serotonine en endorfine in de hersenen aan te maken. Ademhalingsoefeningen en meditatie helpen door het \"ontspannende\" deel van het zenuwstelsel te activeren, zegt Suzuki.\n\nToch is het zelfs voor mensen met mild paniekergedrag soms niet mogelijk om hier volledig van af te komen met een combinatie van lichaamsbeweging en meditatie.\n\nOok kampen er steeds meer mensen met een extreme vorm van bezorgdheid. Suzuki raadt hen aan om met een arts te praten over behandelingsmogelijkheden.\n\nHoe je bezorgdheid positief kunt benutten\n\n1. Koppel elke zorg aan \u00e9\u00e9n actie\n\nSuzuki zegt dat een simpele truc haar helpt om zorgen om te zetten in iets productiefs.\n\nMaak een lijst van dingen waarover je je zorgen maakt en bedenk praktische acties die je kunt ondernemen om ze op te lossen. Alleen al het bedenken van dingen die je kunt doen kan een bevredigend gevoel geven, zegt Suzuki.\n\n\"Vroeg in onze evolutie was de reactie ofwel vechten of wegrennen, omdat het meestal een fysiek gevaar was. Het was niet: 'Oh mijn God, de oceanen warmen op. Wat moet ik doen?\", geeft ze aan. \"Dus door aan iets waarover je piekert een concrete actie te koppelen, kom je terug bij die actiegerichte aanpak van je bezorgdheid.\"\n\n2. Weten hoe bezorgdheid voelt, maakt je empathisch\n\nSuzuki zegt dat ze altijd verlegen is geweest. Hoewel ze school leuk vond, worstelde ze met het actief meedoen tijdens de les. Toen ze zelf docent werd, gaf dit haar idee\u00ebn over de omgang met studenten.\n\n\"Ik realiseerde me dat die persoonlijke zorgen een superkracht voor me werden. Ik kwam vroeg en bleef laat, en zorgde ervoor dat ik zoveel mogelijk van die onbeantwoorde vragen [van verlegen studenten, red.] kon beantwoorden door aanwezig te zijn\", zegt ze.\n\nAls we begrijpen hoe het is om zorgen te ervaren, kunnen we mensen helpen met vergelijkbare problemen.\n\n3. Doe inspiratie op bij anderen om anders om te gaan met je zorgen\n\nWat je kan helpen beter om te gaan met je zorgen, is om te kijken naar hoe anderen dezelfde situatie zouden benaderen. \"Wie zijn de leerlingen in de klas die je het meest bewondert om wat ze doen? Wie zijn de leraren? Wie zijn de leiders in je leven? Wie zijn de schrijvers die je het meest bewondert? Hoe pakken zij projecten aan en wat is hun mentaliteit?\", zegt Suzuki.\n\nZe zegt dat dit niet bepaald gemakkelijk is, maar dat het kan helpen als je het serieus neemt. Op deze manier kun je je bezorgdheid gebruiken om de persoon te worden die je wilt zijn.\n\nLEES OOK: Hoge werkdruk en stress op de werkvloer bij krapte op de arbeidsmarkt", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Luister hieronder naar de audioversie van dit artikel\n\n15 15 0:00\n\nEr staan voor de komende jaren tientallen ruimtemissies naar de maan gepland.\n\nMaar op dit moment is er geen satellietnavigatiesysteem tussen de aarde en de maan.\n\nRuimtevaartorganisaties NASA en ESA zijn manieren aan het ontwikkelen om raketten te helpen zelfstandig naar de maan te navigeren.\n\nLees ook: Waarom we terugkeren naar de maan, en daar sinds 1972 niet meer zijn geweest\n\nToen de Artemis 1-missie van de NASA in november 2022 met succes om de maan heen vloog, toonde dat aan dat de mensheid op koers ligt om terug te keren naar de maan.\n\nDe ruimtevaartorganisaties NASA en de European Space Agency (ESA) willen in 2025 voet op de maan zetten en in de jaren daarna een permanente maanbasis gaan bouwen. China en Rusland werken ook samen om een eigen maanbasis te bouwen, waar vanaf 2036 de eerste landingen zullen plaatsvinden.\n\nMaar op dit moment is er geen gps op weg naar de maan. Astronauten kunnen niet zelfstandig navigeren en moeten tijdens hun missies vertrouwen op experts aan de grond. Maar die praktijk zal snel onhoudbaar worden met de vele missies die op de agenda staan.\n\nRuimtevaartorganisaties zijn daarom bezig satellietnavigatie te ontwikkelen (satnav) voor raketten die de ruim 384.000 kilometer tussen de aarde en de maan moeten afleggen. Ook zijn er plannen om een heel nieuw GPS-netwerk rond de maan aan te leggen.\n\nDe huidige manier van navigeren in de ruimte is duur en omslachtig\n\nFoto: NASA\n\nDe enige manier waarop je momenteel van A naar B kunt komen in de ruimte is door gebruik te maken van ingewikkelde natuurkundige berekeningen, die voor elke missie verschillend zijn.\n\nTijdens de ruimtereis is de aarde het enige referentiepunt. Dus moeten ruimtevaartuigen steeds signalen terugsturen naar de aarde om te kunnen bepalen waar ze zich bevinden en dat betekent dat er enorme blinde vlekken zijn.\n\nNASA verloor alle communicatie met Orion, het ruimtevaartuig dat werd gebruikt tijdens de Artemis 1-missie, toen het zich aan de achterzijde van de maan bevond. Gedurende een aantal minuten konden de ingenieurs alleen maar hun adem inhouden in de hoop Orion weer onbeschadigd aan de andere kant tevoorschijn zou komen.\n\nDat is omslachtig en duur, zegt hoofdingenieur Javier Ventura-Traveset van Galileo Navigation Science Office van de ESA tegen Insider. (De Amerikaanse overheid runt GPS; Galileo is de Europese versie.)\n\nWat de ruimtevaart nodig heeft is een manier waarop ruimtevaartuigen zelf hun positie kunnen bepalen, zonder dat ze input vanaf de aarde nodig hebben.\n\nHet helpt enorm om de satellieten die rond de aarde draaien te gebruiken\n\nVerrassend genoeg is het benutten van de satellieten die rond de aarde draaien de goedkoopste manier om satellietnavigatie tot diep in de ruimte mogelijk te maken, zegt senior ingenieur Elizabeth Rooney van de firma Surrey Satellite Technology tegen Insider. Haar bedrijf werkt samen met ESA aan de ontwikkeling van satellietnavigatie in de ruimte.\n\nEr zijn wel een paar grote hindernissen bij deze aanpak. De belangrijkste daarvan is dat de satellieten naar de aarde zijn gericht.\n\nDat betekent dat het grootste deel van de signalen van de satellieten worden geblokkeerd. Daardoor blijft er maar een heel zwak signaal over en dat wordt verder weg van de aarde alleen maar nog zwakker.\n\nFoto: NASA\n\nVanwege die enorme beperking lijkt het misschien onmogelijk satellietsignalen te gebruiken om naar de maan te navigeren. Maar ingenieurs zijn al tientallen jaren bezig met het ontwikkelen van hele gevoelige detectoren die diep in de ruimte toch satellietsignalen kunnen oppikken.\n\nEn daar zijn ze in geslaagd.\n\nIn 2019 waren vier ruimtesondes in staat hun positie te bepalen door gebruik te maken van gps-signalen van satellieten die rond de aarde draaien.\n\nEn ze waren toen volgens Ventura-Traveset zo'n 187.000 kilometer van de aarde verwijderd, ongeveer halverwege de route tussen de aarde en de maan.\n\nOp weg naar de maan\n\nDe volgende stap is het kunnen oppikken van signalen tijdens de tweede helft van de reis. Ventura-Traveset heeft er vertrouwen in dat dat gaat lukken.\n\nESA en NASA zijn bezig hun detectoren verder te verfijnen, zodat ze tot op nog grotere afstand signalen kunnen oppikken van de satellieten rond de aarde. Ze gaan de detectoren testen tijdens komende missies naar de maan.\n\nFoto: ESA-K Oldenburg/Insider\n\nDe ontvanger van ESA, genaamd NaviMoon, moet mee aan boord van de Lunar Pathfinder-satelliet die in 2025 of 2026 gelanceerd zal worden. Volgens ESA zal NaviMoon in staat zijn de positie van de satelliet tot op 60 meter nauwkeurig te bepalen.\n\nEr is goede hoop dat de satelliet met dank aan de detector zelfstandig om de maan heen kan navigeren, zegt Ventura-Traveset. NaviMoon weegt nog geen 4 kilo en kan veel zwaardere apparatuur aan boord vervangen.\n\nFoto: SSTL\n\nNASA werkt samen met de Italiaanse ruimtevaartorganisatie ook aan de verdere ontwikkeling van detectoren. Ze willen de eerste ontvangers in 2024 naar het maanoppervlak brengen als onderdeel van het Lunar GNSS Receiver Experiment.\n\nEr is een \"soort van vriendschappelijke concurrentiestrijd\" tussen ESA en NASA om satellietnavigatie naar de maan te brengen\", zegt onderdirecteur beleid en communicatie van de NASA, James Joseph \"JJ\" Miller, in een interview met Insider.\n\nVolgens Miller overwegen vele andere landen te gaan investeren in navigatietechnologie voor diep in de ruimte. \"Iedereen realiseert zich dat dit hard nodig.\"\n\nUiteindelijk hebben we een satellietnavigatienetwerk rondom de maan nodig\n\nFoto: ESA-K Oldenburg/Insider\n\nDe signalen van satellieten die om de aarde draaien kunnen ruimtevaartuigen misschien helpen om naar de maan te komen, maar als ze daar eenmaal zijn hebben ze weinig meer aan het signaal.\n\nSignalen reiken slechts tot wat zichtbaar is vanaf de aarde, dus de donkere kant van de maan en de maanpolen liggen buiten het bereik.\n\nHet plan is daarom de maan zijn eigen vloot van communicatie- en navigatiesatellieten te geven, genaamd het Moonlight-initiatief. Het eerste deel van Moonlight moet de Pathfinder-satelliet van NASA worden.\n\nVentura-Traveset zegt dat ESA de basisinfrastructuur van Moonlight gaat testen in 2027 en een verdere uitbreiding daarvan in 2030.\n\nNASA is ook bezig met het ontwikkelen van zijn eigen netwerk: LunaNet. Het ruimtestation Gateway dat de NASA in een baan om de maan wil brengen wordt een belangrijk onderdeel van het netwerk.\n\n\"We hebben een soort van architectuur nodig waarbij de satellieten van NASA en ESA samenwerken\", zegt Miller.\n\nMaanbewoners hebben supersnel internet nodig\n\nFoto: ESA\n\nEr is ook een meer commercieel aspect aan de terugkeer van mensen op de maan. Op langere termijn zullen maanbewoners een kamp moeten opzetten om mineralen en water te kunnen winnen, waardoor raketten naar Mars van brandstof voorzien kunnen worden.\n\nMensen op de maan zullen met de aarde moeten kunnen communiceren, goed met elkaar moeten kunnen praten en vermaakt worden, geeft Ventura-Traveset aan.\n\nUiteindelijk zullen maanbewoners toegang moeten krijgen tot supersnel internet om te kunnen videobellen met hun geliefden op aarde, films en tv-programma's te kunnen streamen en hun eigen content te kunnen cre\u00ebren vanuit de ruimte, zegt Ventura-Traveset. \"Ik denk niet dat iemand eraan twijfelt dat we die weg in zullen slaan.\"", "label": "human"}

Harrison said police had spoken to several of Alsharif's friends and some of her family members in Egypt. He said there was no indication that she had left the city, but added that police were investigating the possibility that she might have gone to another state. Police are urging anyone with information to come forward. \"If you see or know anything, say something,\" said Harrison. \"It's too small to have a little bit of information. Every bit of information helps us piece together what happened.\" Alsharif's family and friends shared her story on social media, posted leaflets and urged anyone with information to contact authorities. \"We have been looking for our beloved Mirna day and night since yesterday morning.

{"text": "Following the arrest of influencer Andrew Tate in Romania on suspicion of human trafficking and rape, social media was flooded with memes and misinformation from people both condemning and defending him.\n\nTate, 36, has more than 10 million followers across platforms and has become a polarizing figure on Twitch and YouTube, thanks to his extreme misogynistic statements. Videos of him on TikTok have been viewed more than 12 billion times, as of August 2022.\n\nIn a news release about Tate\u2019s arrest, Romanian law enforcement said Tate and his brother, Tristan, along with two Romanian citizens, recruited women by \u201cmisrepresenting their intention\u201d to have a romantic relationship, then moved and housed them in Romania. Law enforcement said the women were then forced to create pornographic content for the group to sell online.\n\nRomanian authorities said in the news release they had been in contact with six alleged victims.\n\nTate has denied the allegations.\n\nThe charges follow a previously publicized investigation into Tate from Romanian authorities, and Tate\u2019s own statements about his business.\n\nAndrew Tate led away by police in Romania, on Dec. 29, 2022. Observator Antena 1 / via AP\n\nOn a since-deleted page on his website, Tate wrote that he had become a \u201cmulti-millionaire\u201d through his \u201cwebcam studio\u201d in Romania. The website page was archived on the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine.\n\n\u201cMy job was to meet a girl, go on a few dates, sleep with her, test if she\u2019s quality, get her to fall in love with me to where she\u2019d do anything I say, and then get her on webcam so we could become rich together,\u201d the website read. A lawyer for Tate didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment about his website description.\n\nDespite the nature of the allegations and Tate\u2019s history of making misogynistic statements, the news of Tate\u2019s arrest has inspired a slew of defenders of the influencer, who have employed misinformation and conspiracy theories to question the validity of the charges brought against Tate. The news has also inspired a wave of memes poking fun at the incident, some of which are based on pure speculation.\n\nPerhaps the most ubiquitous piece of viral speculation spread in the wake of Tate\u2019s arrest was that Romania\u2019s anti-organized crime agency, DIICOT, was able to locate the divisive figure because of a video Tate posted in which Romanian pizza boxes are displayed.\n\nTate posted the pizza box video amid a feud with teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg.\n\nOn Tuesday, Tate tweeted at Thunberg, referring to his \u201c33 cars\u201d and their \u201cenormous emissions.\u201d\n\nThunberg responded on Wednesday, making a joke about Tate\u2019s genitals. In response to Thunberg, Tate tweeted the video that included the pizza boxes.\n\nAfter Tate\u2019s arrest, posts quickly went viral, speculating that the pizza boxes in the video had been an important factor in locating Tate.\n\nBut Ramona Bolla, a spokesperson for DIICOT, refuted that the pizza boxes had anything to do with Tate\u2019s arrest. Bolla told the Associated Press the rumor was \u201cfunny, but no.\u201d Prosecutors said that Tate and his brother had been under criminal investigation since April, according to Reuters, when Tate\u2019s Bucharest mansion was searched by police in connection with human trafficking allegations.\n\nStill, that didn\u2019t stop the misinformation from taking over Twitter and becoming fodder for memes.\n\nAdding to the online confusion around details of Tate\u2019s case, some Twitter users resurfaced old footage of Tate and falsely claimed that he had been released.\n\nOne clip that\u2019s been viewed hundreds of thousands of times on Twitter shows Tate in April 2022 after he was taken into custody and released two days later. One of the tweets falsely stated \u201cAndrew Tate got Released Matrix attack Failed.\u201d\n\nAnother resurfaced clip with millions of views showed a segment of a Tucker Carlson interview with Tate, falsely purporting that he had been released from jail. \u201cANDREW TATE and his Brother have been Released. NO CHARGES,\u201d the tweet falsely claimed.\n\nTate\u2019s Twitter account continued to post on Friday, including the tweet \u201cThe Matrix sent their agents,\u201d which refers to Tate\u2019s embrace of \u201cred pill\u201d culture, which refers to the movie \u201cThe Matrix\u201d and celebrates anti-progressive stances. Some Twitter users pointed to the tweets as potential evidence Tate had been released. After Tate\u2019s tweet, Twitter CEO Elon Musk posted a \u201cMatrix\u201d meme, which was then shared by Tate\u2019s account. In November 2022, Elon Musk restored Tate\u2019s Twitter account. Tate was banned in August 2022 after posting tweets that included saying women bear \u201csome responsibility\u201d for being raped. Musk and Twitter didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nA lawyer representing Tate told NBC News that, as of publication, a judge had remanded the Tate brothers for 30 days, which would mean they would either stay in custody or be offered bail. The lawyer said his clients have contested the decision and Tate maintains his innocence.\n\nRight-leaning influencers with millions of followers who have previously focused on human trafficking as an issue reacted to the news of Tate\u2019s arrest by comparing it to a perceived lack of action in other cases, including that of Jeffrey Epstein, who died while awaiting trial on federal child sex trafficking charges and reportedly hosted a laundry list of high profile individuals at his numerous properties. Some, including those who had defended or platformed Tate in recent months, noted that Tate has not yet been convicted\n\n\u201cHuman traffickers deserve the death penalty,\u201d tweeted Mike Cernovich, who has 1.1 million followers and who tweeted about visiting Tate in Romania along with posting photos of them in September 2019.\n\n\u201cFalse allegations have been used to bring down critics of the establishment,\u201d Cernovich added in the tweet. Cernovich didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nConservative YouTuber Blaire White tweeted, \u201cWhether Andrew Tate is guilty or not, they skipped the entire Jeffrey Epstein client list because he\u2019s their enemy and the people on that list aren\u2019t,\u201d referring to the theoretical list of Jeffrey Epstein's clients.\n\nIn a statement to NBC News, White said, \"If Andrew Tate is guilty of human trafficking I believe he deserves a death sentence.\"\n\nOthers posted or shared an interview clip of Tate predicting he would be arrested, while suggesting the circumstances around his arrest weren\u2019t legitimate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s innocent until proven guilty. Not the other way around. Wait and see is always the wise move,\u201d tweeted rapper Zuby Music, who has 1 million followers and conducted the interview along with the clip. The rapper tweeted in September 2022 that he knows Tate but that Tate isn\u2019t his \u201chero\u201d and he has frequently promoted Tate\u2019s content. He didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTwitch streamer Adin Ross, who\u2019s repeatedly made appearances with Ross, tweeted asking President Joe Biden to \u201cpardon\u201d Tate and said \u201cDonald trump woulda been on it already,\u201d despite the arrest taking place in Romania.\n\nSome Twitter users baselessly suggested Tate was being targeted after he said he had converted to Islam. In late October, Tate publicly said he converted to Islam. In Al-Jazeera, Yousra Samir wrote, \u201cpushback from within the community \u2014 and especially from teachers and scholars \u2014 is critical because Tate\u2019s popularity represents a broader trend of red pill culture taking hold among some Muslim men.\u201d\n\nWhile some defended Tate amid his arrest, others celebrated, mocked or commented on Tate\u2019s detention through memes.\n\nOn Twitter, many responded to Tate\u2019s days-old Twitter feud with Thunberg with jokes about the interaction and Tate\u2019s arrest.\n\n\u201cIt finally happened. Someone got ratioed so hard they got arrested,\u201d one person tweeted in response to the tweets and Tate\u2019s arrest, referring to the ratio of comments to likes on a post.\n\nAnother simply wrote, \u201cmother nature always wins,\u201d along with a photoshopped image of Thunberg standing over Tate\u2019s grave.\n\nDrew Afualo, a content creator with nearly 8 million followers, posted a roughly one-minute-long video in response to the arrest. In the video, Afualo said she saw the news about Tate\u2019s arrest.\n\nFor the majority of the video, Afualo laughed, pausing briefly to say, \u201cWhat a way to end the year.

{"text": "Evusheld injection, a new COVID treatment that people can take before becoming symptomatic, in Chicago on Friday, Feb. 4, 2022.\n\nThe scientists, in a study published online Tuesday in the peer-reviewed journal Cell , found that these subvariants are \"barely susceptible to neutralization\" by the vaccines, including the new omicron boosters. The immune response of people who were vaccinated and had breakthrough infections with prior omicron variants also was weaker against the subvariants.\n\nThe BQ.1, BQ.1.1, XBB and XBB.1 omicron subvariants are the most immune evasive variants of Covid-19 to date, according to scientists affiliated with Columbia University and the University of Michigan. These variants, taken together, are currently causing 72% of new infections in the U.S., according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe omicron subvariants that have become dominant in recent months present a serious threat to the effectiveness of the new boosters, render antibody treatments ineffective and could cause a surge of breakthrough infections, according to a new study.\n\n\"Together, our findings indicate that BQ and XBB subvariants present serious threats to current COVID-19 vaccines, render inactive all authorized antibodies, and may have gained dominance in the population because of their advantage in evading antibodies,\" the scientists wrote.\n\nAlthough these subvariants are more likely to cause breakthrough infections, the vaccines have been shown to remain effective at preventing hospitalization and severe disease from omicron, the scientists wrote.\n\nThe study examined blood samples from people who received three or four shots of the original vaccines, those who received the new omicron boosters after three shots of the original vaccines, and individuals vaccinated with the original shots who also had breakthrough infections from the BA.2 or BA.5 subvariants.\n\nFor people who received the omicron boosters, antibodies that block infection were 24 times lower against BQ.1, 41 times lower against BQ.1.1, 66 times lower against XBB and 85 times lower against XBB.1 compared to their performance against the ancestral strain that emerged in Wuhan, China, in 2019.\n\nHowever, people who received the omicron boosters had modestly higher antibody levels against all of these subvariants compared with people who received three or four shots of the original vaccines, according to the study.\n\nPeople who were vaccinated and had breakthrough infections had the highest antibody levels of any group in the study, though neutralization was also much lower against the subvariants than the ancestral strain.\n\nThe subvariants have evolved away from previous versions of omicron in dramatic fashion. BQ.1.1, for example, is about as different from omicron BA.5 as the latter subvariant is from ancestral Covid strain, according to the study.\n\n\"Therefore, it is alarming that these newly emerged subvariants could further compromise the efficacy of current COVID-19 vaccines and result in a surge of breakthrough infections, as well as re-infections,\" the scientists wrote.\n\nXBB.1, however, presents the biggest challenge. It is about 49 times more resistant to antibody neutralization than the BA.5 subvariant, according to the study. XBB.1, fortunately, is currently causing no more than 1% of infections in the U.S., according to CDC data.\n\nBQ.1.1 and BQ.1 represent 37% and 31% of new infections respectively, while XBB is causing 4.7% of new infections, according to CDC data.", "label": "human"}

The slump will last through 2023.\n\nOnce chief executives and buyout barons recovered from the initial pandemic shock in 2020, they embarked on an epic shopping spree. The following year brought 64% more M&A, according to Refinitiv data, 40% beyond the previous high of $4.1 trillion in 2007, right before the world stared into the financial abyss.\n\nThe latest comedown is therefore understandable, especially given higher interest rates, which contributed to a 17% dip in the S&P 500 Index for the year to mid-December. Meanwhile, deal volume tumbled to about $3.5 trillion, 36% down from the same time a year earlier, though it stayed ahead of 2020\u2019s pace. Those numbers also could face at least one significant revision: The year\u2019s biggest transaction, Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT.O) $69 billion deal for video-game developer Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O), hangs in the balance after U.S. trustbusters sued to stop it.\n\nInvestment bankers are reorienting to the new reality. The emphasis will be on private equity firms seeking to deploy some $800 billion of ageing cash held in buyout funds worldwide as of late November, according to Preqin. Leveraged, the sum could plausibly back some $2 trillion of investment. Private equity firms already accounted for an all-time high of 22% of deal volume in 2022.\n\nCaught with billions of loans that investors no longer want to buy, banks want to clear out their balance sheets before lending again. Buyers and sellers also must adjust to the end of ultra-cheap money. Borrowing costs are up: Debt issued by companies with lower credit ratings yields nearly 9%, roughly double the rate a year earlier, per the ICE BofA Single-B High Yield Index. This financing environment suggests corporate acquirers will use more stock as payment, even as cash-rich industries such as pharmaceuticals can stay active.\n\nDespite hopes of recovery, the acquisition annals portend another tough year for deal advisers, many of whom already are trimming jobs and slashing bonuses. After 2007, M&A volume declined for two years \u2013 falling 52% from peak to trough, before rebounding. The same happened after 2015, albeit with a shallower 21% dip. As potentially bleak economic circumstances loom, bankers will be lucky to eke out a repeat of 2022.\n\nReuters Graphics\n\nFollow @jgfarb on Twitter\n\n(This is a Breakingviews prediction for 2023.

{"text": "The Back (song) The Broadway film Penny Lane, based on a classic children's novel by Roald Dahl, is still as popular and beloved as ever. But when the production was dark last summer, fans were worried about what had changed in the show. The good news is that Penny Lane is back, better than ever. After months of speculation, production has been officially confirmed to be restarted and running again, and the creative team behind the show has struggled to bring the story back to life. The production team has been able to recreate the show's appearance as successfully as it did a decade ago. From well-designed suits and costumes to bizarre music, all the elements that fans liked when the show first premiered came back. But the team is not only content with recreating what was before, but also adding new elements to production. Technology has made tremendous progress over the past decade, and now the show uses cutting-edge technology to make Penny Lane's magic a reality. Project mapping, holograms and 3D animation have all been incorporated into the show to make it more interesting and immersive than ever before. These new technologies allow viewers to feel that they are really in the show, a feeling that will only increase as production progresses. The music numbers were also updated with modern instruments and arrangements. These new musical touches created a new spark for the songs, making them even more memorable. In addition to the technical update, the creative team took the opportunity to refine and perfect the characters and plots of the show. New conversations were added throughout the process, with some subtle changes in rhythm and story. All this together created a work that was as magical and fascinating as when it first premiered. Overall, the team behind Penny Lane created a fresh and exciting piece of work while maintaining the charm of the original.The audience can now enjoy the show as much as they did when it first premiered. Penny Lane is back, it's as charming as ever. Audiences can now watch the show again and remind them why they fell in love with it in the first place. The show takes place in the same theater, so book your tickets now to experience an eternity of classics.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "As a former international flight attendant, I've seen it all during long flights. From turbulence to unexpected delays, I've experienced everything imaginable and learned some tips to help passengers get the best possible experience on long flights. While international flights can sometimes be uncomfortable, these tips can make your journey a little easier. 1.To wear the right clothes Make sure you wear comfortable, loose clothes that don't limit your movement. Keep in mind that the air on an airplane can get cold, so bring a layer that can be added or removed depending on the temperature. I also recommend wearing shoes that are easy to slide and fall off; this will help you pass safety measures faster. Don't be afraid to ask for help. Aircrews can make your flight comfortable, so don't be afraid to ask for their help.If you feel uncomfortable or need some help, please contact the crew at any time. 3. Provision of necessary supplies Carry any necessary items in your carry-on luggage, such as snacks, neck pillows, headphones, medicines and/or books. Don't forget to bring your passport and other important documents. 4. Use of headphones Headphones are a must for international flights. This will help block any ambient noise in the cabin, allowing you to relax and enjoy flying. 5. Keep it wet It is essential to maintain moisture during the flight. Ask your air crew for a bottle of water or other types of drinks, avoid caffeine and alcohol, as these will make you dehydrate more. 6.Frequently resting Take a break every few hours, get up, walk around and stretch your legs. This will help keep your blood circulating and prevent swelling in your feet. 7.Eat well Avoid eating too much on flights; try to stick to light foods and snacks. Make sure you drink plenty of water and avoid foods that are high in sugar or carbohydrates. A healthy diet will help you stay alert and energized. 8.Have fun Make sure you're prepared for activities that help you spend time, such as books, podcasts, movies and games. This will help you stay entertained and distracted during the flight. 9.Invest in Comfort If you have the ability, you can invest in additional comfort items such as seat cushions or neck pillows. These items can vary in terms of comfort during flight. 10. Practical relaxation techniques If you feel stressed or anxious while flying, try practicing some relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or visualizing. This can help you relax and relieve any discomfort. 11. Get some sleep Try to sleep as much as you can during the flight, even a short nap will help refresh your body and mind. Be sure to wear comfortably, avoid heavy meals, and wear some noise-free headphones to help stop any distracting noise. By following these tips, your international flight experience should be pleasant. With a little preparation, you can easily complete long flights.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".. The U.S. Air Force's A-10 Thunder II (also known as Warthog) is one of the most reliable and heavily equipped aircraft in the U.S. military inventory. With dual turbocharged engines, thick metal armor and seven hard points, the A-10 is a powerful force that can be used to attack ground targets and enemy fighters. Recently, a number of A-10 aircraft were discovered at an Air Force Base in Arizona with unique features - a bold and daunting shark tooth smear job running along the length of their noses. Although the paint is mainly cosmetic, it also serves as a reminder of the aircraft's impressive capabilities. The A-10 has been in the U.S. Air Force inventory since the 1970s and is well used for a variety of missions. From its initial role as a close support aircraft to its deployment against enemy ground targets during the Persian Gulf War, and ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the A-10 has proven its value time and again. Perhaps the most striking feature of the A-10 is its ability to withstand huge penalties and move on. Its thick titanium armor helps it resist direct enemy strikes, and its two turbines are designed to survive in various war zone conditions. This impressive toughness earned the A-10 the nickname \"Warthog\", and its fierce shark tooth paint work proved its intimidation and strength. The painting work also helped make the A-10 a recognizable symbol of the U.S. Air Force. During World War II, the U.S. Air Force first painted shark teeth on the A-10's nose. American pilots used to paint shark teeth on their aircraft's nose in order to terrorize their enemies and boost their confidence in their own troops. The presence of modern A-10 bombers was welcomed and praised at an aviation show at Arizona Air Force Base.The unique appearance of these fighters reminds us that, despite the fact that the US Air Force has been in stock for decades, the A-10 is still a powerful force. Its thick armor and impressive array of weapons make it one of the most capable attack aircraft in the U.S. Air Force. But perhaps more important than the plane's impressive physical qualities is the psychological impact of its daunting shark war paint, through which Warthog sends a clear message that American pilots are ready to deal with any adversary.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Real Madrid star Vinicius Jr. accused La Liga of \"doing nothing\" to punish those responsible for his racist abuse in a recent game against Valencia. The 20-year-old Brazilian forward suffered a pitiful defamation when he defeated the team 5-3 at Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in December, sparking strong protests from players, the football team and the anti-racist movement. The little Venius, who joined Real Madrid from Flamengo two years ago, thinks La Liga should do more to combat racism in the Spanish game. \"I've been in Spain for two years and I'm very sad because La Liga doesn't do anything,\" he told reporters. \"It's easy to talk about [racism] and take pictures, but it's hard to do anything. \"It's important for them to investigate and punish those responsible for abuse. I want to see real change and results.\" The news of the event sparked strong protests from international public opinion, with celebrities such as Neymar Jr., Karen Mbappe and Gary Linkel posting messages of solidarity with Vinicius Jr. on social media. At the same time, some prominent politicians also expressed indignation at the news, and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez called on all football authorities to take \"strong and effective action against racism in sport\". This isn't the first time Vinicius Jr. has been subjected to racial abuse in Spain. He was influenced by monkey singing in his game against Atletico Madrid last February, and he was also targeted by fans in a match against Celta Vigo in October. Each time, the judge took no action. According to experts, racial abuse in Spanish football is still widespread, and a 2019 study by the University of Huelva found that 50% of fans experienced or witnessed discrimination during soccer matches. Real Madrid president Florentino Perez called the abuse against Vinicius Junior \"untolerable\" and asked La Liga to take \"decisive action\" against racism. But critics have accused La Liga of being too generous with those responsible for the abuse, citing recent incidents involving racism. Last December, a Spanish fan was suspended for four months for shouting racist abuse at Real Madrid players, but La Liga rejected calls for tougher penalties. The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) also criticized La Liga for its \"failure to address repeated incidents of racial abuse\" in the tournament. Vincentius the Younger reiterated his call to action, insisting that \"nothing has been done\" to punish those who continue to abuse him. He now calls on football authorities to do more, insisting that \"things need to change\" in order to protect players from the influence of racism. \"Football without racism is what we need to strive for,\" he said. \"I hope this event will serve as a wake-up call, and we can begin to see changes in the near future.\" Vinicius Jr.'s statement received a response from many figures in the game, including UEFA President Alexander Seferin, who has vowed to take a hard line against racism in European football. \"I have witnessed firsthand the harm caused by racism and other forms of discrimination,\" he said in a statement. \"We must now redouble our efforts to protect our players, coaches and referees from such behaviour and ensure that it is no longer tolerated on the pitch or in the stands.\" Faced with increasing pressure, La Liga said it was taking new measures to combat racism, including a campaign \"to promote respect and tolerance\" and the establishment of a technical working group to analyse incidents and advise governing bodies on how to respond. For many, however, the key issue is that La Liga has done more to punish those responsible for abuses. Spain's prime minister has called for a \"strong sanctions regime,\" while anti-racist activists have urged the governing body to take tougher penalties and improve investigation procedures. Nothing seems to have changed before that, and as Vinicius the Younger himself has said, racism in Spanish football will continue unless real action is taken.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "South Korea and the United States have already held talks aimed at getting the long-stagnate nuclear program process back on track, and both countries will hold desk exercises in the near future. The exercise will discuss each country's approach to managing the nuclear aspects of bilateral relations as part of a broader effort by both countries to strengthen bilateral ties and reaffirm their commitment to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. The exercise, dubbed the \"North Korea-U.S. Nuclear Program Dialogue,\" which will take place in Seoul over the next few weeks, is an important step for the two countries to relaunch a formal nuclear program process that was put on hold amid tensions in 2016. The initiative comes after recent talks between Washington and Seoul on denuclearization, missile defense, and the deployment of U.S. strategic assets to South Korea, also following a high-level visit by South Korean officials to Washington in May that included discussions with senior U.S. leaders on bilateral issues, including denuclearization. The nuclear program's desk exercises could focus on addressing long-standing security concerns of both sides, as well as finding common ground on the issue of nuclear nonproliferation. The purpose of the exercise was to help both sides better understand each other's positions and deepen their understanding of the challenges facing them. Both sides said the exercise could help advance the nuclear program process, which has been stalled for more than a decade due to a range of issues including differing views on the nuclear issue between the two countries. The talks are expected to be further complicated as Washington and Seoul disagree on the Trump administration's approach to denuclearization, while Seoul takes a more cautious stance on the issue. \"This exercise will provide a useful platform for both countries to better understand each other's positions on the nuclear issue and explore ways to make progress in this area,\" said a senior South Korean official. The exercise will also seek to address some of the key challenges that have emerged over the past few years, including the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, the possibility for Pyongyang to continue building its stockpile of nuclear weapons, and the need for effective verification of any denuclearization agreement. Discussions will also focus on the need to build a stronger regional security architecture and strengthen nuclear non-proliferation efforts. The exercise is seen as a positive step in the process of relaunching the nuclear program dialogue between the two countries, and has the potential to lead to a more formal nuclear program process in the future. The talks are also expected to focus on the importance of continuing pressure on North Korea to denuclearize it, and the United States has made clear that it will not negotiate until Pyongyang takes concrete steps toward verifiable denuclearization. The nuclear programme process may have to cover a number of complex issues, including the need for verification, potential military threats and how to manage any potential nuclear accident. While the exercise won't make an immediate breakthrough, it could help both sides better understand each other's positions and lay the groundwork for future nuclear talks.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".. According to a court document released Tuesday, one suspect in the Idaho murder plans to drop his extradition hearing. John R. Klyce Jr., 58, was charged with four counts of first-degree murder in connection with the deaths of four people on December 1 in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Clays of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, is charged with the murder of Steven and Melanie Croft and their two children, Michael and Ryan. If found guilty, he faces life in prison. On December 10, Clyce was arrested after an international robbery in Florida. In court documents, Clyce's lawyer Randy Schreiber said his client had decided to waive his right to an extradition hearing and would voluntarily agree to return to Idaho. Cleese has been held in Broward County Jail since his arrest and is expected to return to Idaho in the coming days. Clyce's decision to drop his extradition hearing surprised some in Cole d'Alain who had expected the suspect to struggle with extradition. \"I was surprised to hear that he decided to give up his extradition,\" said Paul Weier, a prosecutor in Cotney County, where the murder took place. \"I hope he will strike and take it to a high court in Florida.\" Weir said it would take Clythes several weeks to be sent back to Idaho. He said that once he arrived in Idaho, Clythes would be detained without bail and would have to face charges against him in the local court. Shortly after the bodies of Steven and Melanie Croft and their two sons were discovered, Cleese was initially identified as an \"interested person\" in the case. Kleis worked for the Crofts as a porter and worked at the home where they had been killed. Investigators believe Cleese may have had an unspecified relationship with one of the victims, although they did not release further details about the connection. Cleese fled the area shortly after the shooting. He arrived in Florida more than a week later and was arrested during a high-speed chase that eventually led to his car crashing into a telephone pole. Cleese is charged with four counts of first-degree murder in connection with the murder, and he has not been involved in defending the case and has not made public comments since his arrest. Coeur d'Alene was shocked by the murder, which police and community members described as \"a senseless tragedy.\" The Coeur d'Alene Police Department is continuing its investigation into the case and said they believe Cleese was responsible for the deaths of four victims. A small town in Idaho has followed the case closely, with many residents organizing alerts and community events to honor the victims and provide support for their grieving families. Cleese is expected to return to Idaho in the next few days before he faces a preliminary hearing and charges against him. Cleese could face the death penalty if convicted of a crime he was charged with.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) \u2014 A Democrat who promised to govern as an independent was elected speaker of the narrowly divided Pennsylvania House of Representatives in a surprising move Tuesday on the strength of every Democrat and more than a dozen GOP votes.\n\nRep. Mark Rozzi was elected speaker by a vote of 115-85 after Republicans were unable to convert a temporary two-seat majority into a vote to retain the post. The move to nominate and elect Rozzi only began hours before the vote, but his election also leaves questions about how the chamber will operate in the short term and whether he will remain a Democrat.\n\nRozzi, who began his sixth two-year term from a Reading-area district this week, is best known as a champion of the effort to give victims of child sexual abuse another chance to sue perpetrators or institutions that covered it up over claims that are barred by time limits in current law.\n\nThe November election was so close \u2014 and complicated by the death of one Democrat and the departures of two others who were elected to higher offices \u2014 that what is normally a highly scripted event instead became an afternoon of drama and uncertainty.\n\nDemocrats flipped a net of 12 seats in November, the minimum amount needed to take over the chamber, 102-101, after more than a decade in the minority.\n\nBut that margin is now 101-99 with the three vacancies that will remain open until at least February. Rozzi left questions unanswered Tuesday night about how the chamber will operate in the meantime and who will function as the majority.\n\nIn brief remarks on the House floor, Rozzi said he would be independent and pledged not to caucus with either Republicans or Democrats and to staff his office with members of both parties. He decried dysfunction and obstruction in the chamber\u2019s politics and said \u201cnever has this House been so divided.\u201d\n\n\u201cI pledge allegiance and loyalty to no interest in this building, to no interest in our politics, I pledge my loyalty to the people of the commonwealth,\u201d Rozzi said in his remarks.\n\nStory continues\n\nDemocrats said Rozzi will remain a Democrat and not switch his registration to independent. But Republicans insisted otherwise Tuesday night, saying that Rozzi will become an independent. Assuming Democrats retain the three open seats, Rozzi as an independent would tie the House at 101-101, when every seat is filled.\n\nAppearing with top Democrats several hours after the vote, Rozzi told reporters in the Capitol that his move to the dais was \u201ctotally unexpected.\u201d\n\nBut Rozzi said he would not make any \u201cgrand announcement.\" He refused to take questions from reporters there, including whether he will change his registration to independent.\n\n\u201cThe speakership is a nonpartisan \u2014 and I want to repeat that \u2014 nonpartisan officer of the House, entrusted with maintaining the integrity of the House,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThat will be my focus as speaker.\u201d\n\nEven so, the speakership is not necessarily a nonpartisan office, with the House coming off of a dozen years of Republican speakers who caucused with Republicans and helped lead the Republican majorities.\n\nRozzi had worked alongside Democratic Gov.-elect Josh Shapiro \u2014 and closely with Rep. Jim Gregory, a conservative Republican who nominated him \u2014 in pushing for the lawsuit window after Shapiro, as attorney general, unveiled a landmark grand jury report on his office\u2019s investigation into the state\u2019s Roman Catholic dioceses.\n\nGregory, from Blair County, said he and Rozzi had talked about such a possibility for months but did not bring it up until Gregory contacted House Republican leaders at midafternoon Tuesday and encouraged them to reach out to Rozzi.\n\nEvery Democrat backed Rozzi, as did 16 Republicans, including their floor leader, Bryan Cutler of Lancaster County.\n\nIn a statement, House Republican leaders lauded Rozzi as \u201cPennsylvania\u2019s first Independent Speaker of the House.\u201d\n\n\u201cReflecting the realities of an evenly divided chamber, it is imperative we have a truly independent voice to conduct House business and manage the House floor,\u201d they said.\n\nDemocrats had initially hoped to elevate their floor leader, Joanna McClinton of Philadelphia, to become the state\u2019s first woman speaker, although it was not clear that Republicans would support her candidacy for speaker.\n\nInstead, Democrats went along with Rozzi, who drew Republican support and overcame the rival candidacy of Rep. Carl Walker Metzgar, R-Somerset, who received 85 votes.\n\nIn the meantime, Cutler has a pending lawsuit designed to delay the special elections to fill two of the three vacant Democratic seats until May.\n\nMcClinton has moved to schedule those elections for Feb. 7, with the third special election.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Marc Levy in Harrisburg contributed to this report.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "LONDON (Reuters) - The British government has said it will ban Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist group after the United States took similar action last year. In a statement released late Thursday, the UK Foreign Office said the designation would take effect from Friday, making it a criminal act to become a member or supporter of the IRGC. \"The government has decided to completely ban the Islamic Revolutionary Guards under the Terrorism Act of 2000,\" it said. \"The Royal Navy recently seized illegal Iranian weapons destined for Yemen, and we want to send a clear message that we will not tolerate the actions of such aggressive and destabilizing forces,\" Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is a branch of Iran's military that was established after the 1979 Iranian revolution. It has been at the forefront of Tehran's regional power projection, including supporting militias in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, as well as defending President Bashar al-Assad's government during the Syrian civil war. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has also been accused of violating the United Nations arms embargo by supplying sophisticated weapons to Yemen's Houthi rebels. Last April, Washington declared the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps of Iran a foreign terrorist organization, in a move that angered Tehran and heightened tensions in the Middle East. The British decision was welcomed by some politicians in the United States. \"We are grateful to the United Kingdom for its decision to stand with us in banning the entire IRGC,\" U.S. Special Representative for Iran Elliot Abrams said in a statement. \"We must continue to unite against the evil influence of the Iranian regime around the world,\" he said. However, the move was condemned by Tehran. \"The British government's illegal and unacceptable decision to follow the U.S. blacklist of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps violates the most basic international laws, norms and conventions,\" Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in a statement on Friday. He warned that Britain's move \"would only exacerbate insecurity and instability in the region and beyond.\" The UK's decision comes after a series of U.K. and U.S. sanctions on Iran in recent months targeted the country's economic activities, particularly its oil and gas sector. The UK has also joined the U.S. and European partners in a maritime security mission in the Gulf region to protect merchant ships from \"piracy and other threats.\" The mission is designed to ensure freedom of navigation in the Strait of Hormuz, an important waterway for global energy supply. The British government said it wanted to avoid an escalation of tensions with Tehran, and a senior British diplomat said that London would keep channels of dialogue with the Iranian government despite new appointments. \"We will still talk to the Iranian authorities, but we have made it clear that we will not tolerate actions by such evil forces,\" he said. The move, however, has been condemned by human rights activists who argue that the appointment will only further solidify hardliners already in power in Iran. \"We are concerned about the terrorist list of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps and its associated forces, which are responsible for serious human rights violations in Iran and throughout the Middle East, that could be used to further suppress dissent,\" said Maya Foa from Repriev. She argued that the name could be used to mask peaceful criticism of the Iranian regime, and people were afraid to say it \"for fear of being prosecuted\". She warned that the move could also hamper the work of international aid organizations if they are found to be collaborating with organizations associated with IRGC. Despite the controversy, the British government insists that this decision was made to maintain regional and global security and work with partners in the region and beyond to curb Iranian aggression. \"The UK will take strong action against anyone who threatens our security and our allies,\" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday. \"The illegal actions of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and its agents in the region are a threat to global security,\" he said. \"We have sent a clear message: we will not allow these destabilizing activities to go unchecked, and the UK will continue to stand with our allies in taking appropriate measures against the regime in Tehran.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "As the CEO of FanDuel, Amy Howe accomplished a feat this year that so far no other US sports-betting platform has been able to achieve: profitability.\n\nThe company, whose businesses include fantasy sports, sports gambling, online casino games, and horse racing, in September posted its first-ever profit \u2014 when excluding certain costs \u2014 and forecast full-year profitability for 2023, at least a year before DraftKings, its closest rival, plans to follow suit.\n\nFanDuel, which is owned by the Dublin-based Flutter Entertainment, projects revenue of $3 billion for 2022 and has said that the total market for online gambling could reach more than $40 billion by 2030.\n\nAnalysts say that Howe, who joined FanDuel in February of 2021 as interim CEO and officially got the top job six months after that, deserves much of the credit for the company's growth. They say she's maintained a rigorous focus on the bottom line, while also making a series of creative and savvy business moves.\n\n\"Howe has managed to strike a delicate balance between continually reinvesting in the business while also recognizing that the market is calling for profitability,\" Chris Grove, a partner emeritus at Eilers & Krejcik, a boutique research and consulting firm, told Insider.\n\n\"That's an intricate waltz and she is managing it to perfection,\" Grove said.\n\nSeeking constant innovation\n\nThis year Howe launched FanDuel TV, a 24-hour television network, which features a mix of studio programming and live sports. She also sealed deals with the WNBA and the New York Yankees, making FanDuel the official sportsbook partner and official daily fantasy partner for the league and team.\n\nHowe, who is the only female CEO at a major US sportsbook operator, has also been instrumental in expanding FanDuel's customer base by encouraging more women to wager on sports. At the SBC Summit North America trade show and conference this year, she described the female market as an \"untapped opportunity\" and detailed a number of FanDuel's initiatives to bring more women bettors into the fold.\n\n\"You have to learn the art of influencing your stakeholders,\" said Howe. Steven Ferdman/Getty Images\n\n\"By no means have we cracked the code on this, but I think supporting female athletes and advocating for equity with female athletes is really important,\" Howe said at SBC.\n\nThere are challenges ahead, however. Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia have legalized sports betting, according to the American Gaming Association, but the regulatory environment might soon become less friendly. And while FanDuel has long had an impressive command of the US market share and recently extended its sizable lead over DraftKings, the industry is fiercely competitive and new players continue to emerge.\n\nHowe is undaunted but remains cautious. \"We're always a little bit paranoid about making sure that we can continue to maintain that position,\" Howe told Insider last year. \"We're constantly trying to figure out, 'How do we innovate?' So that our flywheel spins even faster than our competitors.\"\n\nLeaning on pragmatism and subtle influence\n\nHowe arrived at FanDuel after a successful seven-year run at Live Nation Entertainment. She held several positions, including president and chief operating officer at Ticketmaster, where she worked on the company's transition from paper tickets to digital passes. Before that, Howe, who has an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, was a longtime partner at McKinsey & Co.\n\nHowe told the \"Corporate Competitor Podcast\" in August that consulting often involves dealing with politically or emotionally charged issues, and there's an art to making such challenges less fraught. She also said she developed \"a healthy dose of pragmatism\" when she moved from consulting to being in an operations role within an organization.\n\n\"You have to learn the art of influencing your stakeholders, in many cases a broad set of stakeholders, and those people don't report to you,\" she said on the podcast. \"When I first came into Live Nation, and even FanDuel, nobody reported to me, but I got a lot done because I knew how to work in an organization.\"\n\nHowe's pragmatism and subtle influence have served her and the company well, said Grove, the analyst. \"She could have come into FanDuel and said, 'I want to do things my way,' but instead she looked around at the market, talked to consumers, and listened to her internal team,\" he said.\n\n\"And by virtue of her humility, she's been able to blend those competing perspectives into a coherent and successful vision for the company.\"", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Jim Tibensky was in the middle of trying to save a bald eagle stranded on a patch of ice in Waukegan Habor when he realized he had to alter his plan of action.\n\nTibensky had kayaked to the middle of the harbor, towing another kayak, intending to put the eagle in it and pull it back to shore.\n\nBut it turned out, the second kayak wouldn\u2019t be needed, said Annette Prince, director of Chicago Bird Collision Monitors.\n\nAs Tibensky approached the eagle, he noticed the wave created by his kayak pushed the chunk of ice on which the eagle sat. As Tibensky paddled closer, the kayak itself was able to push the ice.\n\n\u201cHe had a brilliant strategy of realizing this bird was floating on a piece of ice and rather than grabbing it, if he were to continue to push the little iceberg that he was sitting on back toward shore where I was, I\u2019d be able to reach down and pull it up with a net,\u201d Prince said.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what happened. After Tibensky slowly paddled and nudged the eagle to shore, Prince scooped it from the harbor and placed it in a cage.\n\nHer group, which operates a 24-hour hotline for bird rescue reports, had gotten a call about 10:30 a.m. Sunday. A group of birdwatchers at the harbor said the bald eagle was stuck on ice, looked lethargic and could not stand up straight.\n\nOnce they scooped it up, they took the eagle to Willowbrook Wildlife Center in Glen Ellyn, where it underwent blood tests and treatment. The tests revealed symptoms consistent with having ingested rodent poisoning, most likely from prey.\n\nAnnette Prince of the Chicago Bird Collision Monitors holds a bald eagle that was rescued Sunday from the Waukegan Harbor. Tamima Itani | Provided\n\nBut since arriving at the wildlife center, the eagle quickly warmed up and gained some energy.\n\n\u201cThey put him on treatment and that night he ate all the food that they put in his cage,\u201d Prince said. \u201cHe was actively eating, sitting up, made a big mess in his cage, kind of tore up the towels and everything so he\u2019s got some spunk in him.\u201d\n\nWhile the eagle is still not fully alert, the quick turnaround in his condition has the non-profit bird rescue group optimistic of a successful recovery.\n\nThe eagle is about three years old. The wildlife center could not determine whether it is male or female due to it being significantly underweight, Prince said. Bald eagles develop a full white head at around five years old.\n\nIt was the first save of 2023 for the Chicago Bird Collision Monitors, which rescued more than 5,000 birds last year across Chicago and the suburbs.\n\nAs it happens, last\u2019s year\u2019s first rescue also was on New Year\u2019s Day, also of a bald eagle \u2014 and that eagle also had ingested rat poison. It was found on the side of a road in Brookfield.\n\n\u201cThat one made a full recovery and was released, so we\u2019re all hopeful that the same thing is going to happen for this bird,\u201d Prince said Monday\n\nAnd of the countless rescues the group has made throughout its 20 years of existence, Prince said Sunday\u2019s was \u201cone of the more amazing rescues that I think we pulled off.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt went effortlessly, the bird cooperated, we got him safely contained and he\u2019s got a good chance to survive,\u201d she said. \u201cThose are all really positive things for the start of the year.\u201d", "label": "human"}

{"text": ".. It was a magical night, as the three biggest stars in the game made history at the 2023 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. New York Yankees Jaguar Troy Tulovitzky, Los Angeles Dodgers first base player Adrian Gonzalez and Philadelphia right thrower Blaise Harper all became the first players in MLB history to play three home runs in an All-Star game. The three players turned out to be the night of a difference, with the U.S. league winning its first All-Star Game since 2015, defeating the national league by 6-3. It was Tulovitzky who started the party with a solo blast in former Philadelphia star Cliff Lee's second game, putting AL ahead 1-0. He then broke out with leftist Tony Cingrani's two games in the fourth game, placing AL ahead 3-0. Then, in the sixth set, the former Toronto Blue Jays Assassin threw a 3-2 quick shot from the Dodgers into the Right Whites for the third round. Thus, he became the first player to score three home runs in all-star history. Gonzalez and Harper also made history with their one pair of long balls. Gonzalez connected in the third set with Jason Hammel, right hand of the Cubs, and in the seventh set with Doug Fister, right hand of the Tigers. Harper has already led to that point 0-3, putting forward an exciting point in AL's victory with the ninth being Jansen's two-run homeowner, which is his second place in the race. The three joggers - each considered one of the most dynamic hitters of his generation - were obviously excited about their historic night. After the game, all three expressed surprise at what they had achieved. \"To be honest, I don't think I can play three home runs, let alone be the first to do that,\" Tulovitsky said. Gonzalez responded to the sentiments of his teammates by saying, \"It's really an honor to mention two of the best scorers of this era in one sentence. This is a moment I will never forget.\" Meanwhile, Harper praised his teammates for inspiring him to keep closing until he was able to break through. \"I just had to keep trying and staying focused,\" he said. \"My teammates have been encouraging me all night, which has definitely helped me stay in the area. I can't thank them enough.\" For AL, the victory was particularly sweet. After losing five All-Star games in a row, the American League finally broke through and won, thanks to the historic performance of Tulovitsky, Gonzalez and Harper. The three brightest stars in the game shine on the biggest stage, consolidating their legacy as some of history's greatest players. Three are truly magical numbers, as these three players prove tonight.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "When House Republicans gathered on Tuesday to pick their next leader in a high-risk vote, they knew they would nominate Kevin McCarthy for the second time in a decade. But what was expected of a comfortable coronation turned into an astonishing rejection of the Californians, who were unable to overcome the demands of a group of prestigious dissidents determined to disrupt the process by creating their own role clauses. Eventually, McCarthy's efforts to appease dissidents were frustrated as Republicans could not agree with his candidacy and elect an interim spokesperson to preside over their process. This failure puts lawmakers at a crossroads. After giving up most of their power to appease the House Freedom Caucus, which is made up of 30 to 40 of the toughest members of the Conservative Party, they still cannot win the support needed to move forward. McCarthy, a leader who has been leaving office since mid-2014, vowed to \"unify\" after the Republican Party's disappointing performance in November's election. He is seen as the favorite of Paul Ryan, the succeeding outgoing House Speaker, but his tough tactics and track record of loyalty to President Donald Trump put him at a distinct disadvantage, which has struggled to please the party's right wing. It was widely expected that McCarthy would win the party's nomination in the first round of voting, followed by a formal election for him as Speaker of the House. But the Republican dissident camp led by Mark Meadows, chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, rejected McCarthy's candidacy and instead called for a so-called \"Mu character\" vote to avoid the outcome of the first round. Faced with the possibility that McCarthy would fail to win, and with Meadows threatening to deny the Republicans the 218 votes needed to win the presidency, McCarthy surrendered. In a last-minute move, in order to win the Freedom Caucus, McCarthy agreed to delay the speaker's vote by two weeks, allowing members to consider other candidates. McCarthy won only 199 votes in Tuesday's vote, far less than the 218 needed to win. As a result, without a speaker in the House of Representatives, it could be plunged into a devastating government shutdown if no resolution is passed in the near future. McCarthy's failure to win the 10th House of Representatives vote is another painful blow to the Republican Party and its majority leader in the House, who are struggling to recover from record low support. The incident showed that McCarthy's mode of appeasement - giving up power in the name of unity - did not unite divided parties, but instead sowed more discontent. Looking ahead, McCarthy will have to prove that he can keep the party together as it looks for a new spokesman and tries to govern in a chaotic Washington environment. But given how Tuesday's vote unfolds, there seems to be a steep mountain at stake for McCarthy to climb. Failure to win the presidency will undoubtedly cast a shadow over McCarthy's future political prospects, as he may find himself in the defense of those who believe that if he did not yield to dissidents, he could have become a more effective leader. The defeat has also left House Republicans losing a leader in the crucial period leading up to the 2022 midterm elections. With McCarthy withdrawing from the race, Republicans will have to seek new leaders to unite them and prove they can govern as a majority.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Crossmark's Bob Doll sees another lackluster year ahead for stocks.\n\nDoll said in a note on Tuesday that he sees a recession coming.\n\nHe added that inflation would remain above 2% and the Fed would leave rates elevated.\n\n2022 was a rough year for the stock market, with the S&P 500 closing out the year down nearly 20%. Unfortunately for investors, things aren't likely to get much better for the market in 2023, says Bob Doll, the CIO at Crossmark Global Investments and former chief US equity strategist at BlackRock.\n\n\"2023 is shaping up to be another challenging year for investors,\" Doll said in his yearly predictions note on Tuesday. He said he expects October 2022 lows of 3,577 for the S&P 500 to be re-tested.\n\nDoll's bleak outlook for the market is informed by a combination of his first four predictions for 2023. For one, he doesn't see inflation falling back to 2%, and therefore sees the fed funds rate hitting 5% and staying there for the duration of 2023.\n\nThe cumulative effect of tight policy will eventually catch up to the economy this year, and send it into a mild recession, Doll believes. This will lead to downward revisions in earnings expectations, he said, as spending falls and inflation continues to into profits for businesses.\n\n\"We acknowledge the Fed could blink and acquiesce to a 3-4% inflation rate 'for the time being,' in which a soft landing might be possible,\" Doll said. \"But if the Fed insists on their 2% target, a recession is almost inevitable. In the meantime, what the Fed has already done (raising rates from zero to 4 \u00bc% in a short period of time) will have a delayed impact on the economy, to be felt in 2023.\"\n\nHe continued: \"In either scenario, analysts' estimates for earnings are still too high and will need to be reduced. The consensus forecast for 2022 earnings is $231 for the S&P 500 and $254 for 2023. Our estimates are $200 and $230.\"\n\nBut while Doll sees some downside, he also expects some upward volatility, and for stocks to start to bounce back when the economic picture starts to clear up. Conversely, he sees bonds outperforming stocks into the recession, and then underperforming when a recovery is underway.\n\nWhen all is said and done, however, he expects the stock market to stay range-bound, and doesn't see it rising more than 10%. The same is true for other major asset classes, he said.\n\nWhere to expect outperformance\n\nDoll does expect some areas of the market to outperform others, however. Generally, he likes value stocks over growth stocks, and thinks the energy, consumer staples, and financials sectors will perform best. Meanwhile, he's more bearish on the utilities, technology, and communication services sectors.\n\nThe Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE), the Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (VDC), and the iShares U.S. Financials ETF (IYF) offer exposure to the sectors Doll is more bullish on.\n\nDoll also said international stocks will beat US stocks in 2023, which would mark their first outperformance of US stocks in back-to-back years since 2006 and 2007.\n\nThe iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF (IXUS) offers exposure to stocks outside of the US.\n\nFinally, given the muted returns he sees this year for the broader market, Doll expects active fund managers to beat passive index funds this year. For reference, 80% of active funds were beaten by index funds in 2021, and index funds have generally outperformed active funds, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "NILES, Mich. \u2014 For decades, Mike Noonan was the consummate Illinois political insider. He aggressively worked on Democratic campaigns in all sorts of communities and was a big player in the behind-the-scenes jostling over legislation at the state Capitol.\n\nAfter years as a staffer and top political operative for longtime Democratic boss Michael Madigan, Noonan was a lobbyist with a long roster of clients in Springfield.\n\nBut a corruption scandal ended Madigan\u2019s long reign last year. And since then, Noonan has left Illinois entirely.\n\nLast summer, Noonan began what he hopes will be a mellower, second career as an owner of an organic marijuana farm and certified \u201cganjier\u201d in this small city in southwest Michigan.\n\nNoonan, 54, says he\u2019s done with politics in Illinois and is dedicating himself to fighting for \u201cthe craft weed revolution\u201d in his new home on the other side of Lake Michigan.\n\n\u201cLife has really transitioned, and all for the better,\u201d Noonan says, wearing a smock in the retail shop of his Southland Farms in Niles, Mich., about 100 miles from Chicago.\n\nNoonan refers to the shop at Southland Farms as a \u201cbudtique\u201d \u2014 reflecting the business\u2019 aim of providing an upscale experience and \u201cquality weed\u201d for cannabis consumers.\n\nNext to the cash register at the front of the store, Noonan proudly displays the certificate he earned as a ganjier \u2014 a certified connoisseur of fine weed. He passed a course in northern California to become one of what are fewer than 200 ganjiers in the world, trained to guide cannabis users much as a sommelier advises wine drinkers.\n\nAlthough he was not personally implicated in the Illinois corruption scandal, the native of Chicago\u2019s south suburbs says he felt it was the right time for him to leave the political scene.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe I wasn\u2019t the best at identifying the people who shouldn\u2019t be in politics, because obviously, I still like and care for plenty of folks who are now seen as scoundrels.\n\n\u201cFor me, it was time to move on. Because I had accomplished a lot, and I felt good about what I had done.\u201d\n\nGetting \u2018Noonan-ed\u2019\n\nNoonan began as a staffer for Madigan in 1994 and managed state legislative campaigns for his allies and others in the Illinois Democratic Party. He came to wider prominence 20 years ago by managing the first campaign for Illinois attorney general of the boss\u2019 daughter, Lisa Madigan.\n\nNoonan relished popping up outside her Republican rival\u2019s news conferences to offer instant rebuttals for reporters. He was so good at it that rivals griped about \u201cgetting Noonan-ed.\u201d\n\nMike Noonan managed Lisa Madigan\u2019s campaign for Attorney General in 2002. Sun-Times file photo\n\nEven before going into politics, Noonan says he had a deep appreciation for marijuana \u2014 using it since 1986, when it was still illegal.\n\nHe says Madigan became aware of his weed habit in 1996, when a competitor in politics reported him. He thought it would cost him his job but recalled his supervisor in the Madigan organization telling him he would not be fired.\n\n\u201cI had been a hard-working guy, and I think, more importantly, I had been successful for them,\u201d Noonan says. \u201cAnd so the reprimand that I got from my boss at the time was, \u2018You\u2019ve been reported. It doesn\u2019t seem to be affecting your work at all. See you tomorrow.\u2019\u201d\n\nNoonan also believes Madigan gave him a pass because he understood that, \u201cNobody is just one thing. And people can be good, and they can be bad.\u201d A lawyer for Madigan declined to comment on Noonan\u2019s recollection of that incident.\n\nComEd scandal rocks Springfield\n\nAfter helping Lisa Madigan win statewide office, Noonan became a lobbyist in Springfield for mostly corporate clients.\n\nAmong the companies he represented in the Illinois Capitol was Commonwealth Edison. The giant power utility admitted in 2020 it had hired Madigan allies as consultants and paid them for little or no work to curry favor with the speaker, who helped pass legislation that padded ComEd\u2019s profits dramatically.\n\nMadigan resigned last year and has been indicted in the scandal, but he has denied any wrongdoing and his case is pending in federal court.\n\nAccording to federal court records and sources, Noonan\u2019s then-business partner Victor Reyes won a contract for his law firm with ComEd, allegedly as part of the electric company\u2019s efforts to please Madigan. Reyes has not been charged with a crime, and Noonan says he had nothing to do with Reyes\u2019 law firm.\n\nThe situation hurt business for the Roosevelt Group, the lobbying and public-relations business Noonan owned with Reyes in downtown Chicago. Noonan says he sold his stake in the Roosevelt Group, and records show he canceled his registration as a lobbyist in Illinois in July 2021.\n\n\u201cI was associated with a lot of people who aren\u2019t in politics any longer, many of them because the federal government decided they shouldn\u2019t be in politics any longer,\u201d he said.\n\nAt that point, he said he decided, \u201cI need another act.\u201d\n\nSouthland Farms is located in southwestern Michigan. Dan Mihalopoulos/WBEZ\n\nA new career in the weed business\n\nNoonan says he is now one of the little guys trying to provide a classier, higher-quality alternative to the products offered by big marijuana interests.\n\nEverything in his store in Michigan is grown on site, from seed. Behind the budtique, Southland Farms has five climate-controlled rooms full of dozens of highly pungent, leafy marijuana plants. All the products are processed on the premises and sold exclusively there.\n\nTo become a ganjier, he underwent six months of online training, three days of in-person classes and a day-long exam in Humboldt County, Calif., in July. That same month, Southland Farms opened its door.\n\nIn Noonan\u2019s office, there\u2019s just a single reminder of his 25 years in politics: a \u201c24 hours to victory\u201d sign from an election-eve rally for Todd Stroger\u2019s campaign for Cook County Board president in 2006. Stroger won narrowly, after then-U.S. senator named Barack Obama appeared at the rally.\n\nNoonan says the sign reminds him to \u201cjust keep fighting \u2018till the end\u201d \u2014 and to not hesitate to ask for help from friends in times of need.\n\nDan Mihalopoulos is a reporter on WBEZ\u2019s Government & Politics Team.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "In the back of it. When news emerged in January that Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, were \"retiring\" from their senior royal roles, the British public was fed up with the plot, speculation immediately turning to a reported \"rift\" between Harry and his brother, Prince William. In fact, the family struggle dates back to the 1600s, when Britain first began establishing its royal family. Here's a few centuries of history behind Harry and William's fight. 1600s For much of the early history of the British royal family, siblings and cousins often competed with each other for their rightful place. A notable example is the rivalry between Elizabeth I's cousins Robert and Henry, who both sought to become Kings of England in the late 16th century. 1700s The brothers of George III, Frederick and William, were said to have been at odds for years. They allegedly had a deep rivalry, partly because of their roles in court. Frederic died in 1751 and was considered the most influential person among the two brothers - the king gave him more power and influence than William, who continued his private life after his wife's death. 1800s When Queen Victoria came to power in 1837, her family found themselves caught up in another internal battle. Edward, Victoria's eldest son, is said to have a disagreement with his brother Alfred - and Albert, Alfred's son - about the way they should act as princes. Category: 1900s In the 1920s, Edward VIII, who came to power in 1936, found himself at odds with his brother George. Edward became interested in Wallis Simpson, an American woman who had been divorced - something that was not accepted by the royal court at the time. 2017 - Today's Reports of the quarrel have been spinning since last spring, and Harry and Meghan's recent announcement that they will withdraw from their royal roles further exacerbates it. While it is not clear what caused the split between the two brothers, it may be related to a centuries-old history of royal wrestling. II. Conclusions The British royal family has experienced considerable internal struggle since the 1600s, and the present-reported domestic drama is certainly no exception. Only time will tell if Harry and William can set aside their differences and address the root of what they have reported as a crack.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Mastodon homepage is seen displayed on a mobile phone screen held by hand. It has been reported that more than 200.000 new users flocked the social media app after the takeover of Twitter by Elon Musk.\n\nOne of the biggest beneficiaries of billionaire Elon Musk's chaotic ownership of Twitter is a small social network most people hadn't heard of two months ago.\n\nMastodon, an alternative microblogging platform, has seen several spikes in user sign-ups since the world's second-wealthiest man purchased Twitter in late October. Hourly data from a Mastodon user counter shows that the surges typically happened shortly after some of Musk's most headline-grabbing actions.\n\nMastodon-powered sites averaged about 130 new sign-ups per hour from Oct. 1 to Oct. 26. That number jumped to 2,000 per hour after Elon Musk took control of Twitter on Oct. 28. Sign-ups rose to more than 5,000 per hour after Twitter began mass layoffs a week later, and peaked at almost 10,000 per hour after employees resigned en masse following an email ultimatum on Nov. 17.\n\nThe service again saw spikes in mid-December, when Twitter suspended journalists who had been reporting on Musk and the company, and again when Twitter abruptly banned users from sharing links to their profiles at other major social networks.\n\nSince Musk's takeover of Twitter, journalists, news organizations, authors and politicians have created Mastodon accounts. But Mastodon, which is open-source and built around a model of hundreds of small sites that talk to each other instead of one large site, is still very small.\n\nThere are about 8.7 million users across Mastodon-powered sites tracked by instance tracker Instances.social as of Wednesday.

{"text": ".. Savers are receiving a Christmas gift from the government: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has raised the cap on 401(k) donations for the first time since 2015. Starting in 2023, the limit on how much money employees can contribute to employer-sponsored retirement accounts will jump nearly 10 percent from $18,000 to $19,500. This news marks a shift in the long-term planning landscape, as the retirement crisis continues to worsen. According to Boston College's Center for Retirement Research, the latest data shows that Americans have an alarming $7 trillion gap in retirement savings. The current restrictions apply to employees and employers; employers can choose to match that amount, tax-free. In 2023, the new restrictions will apply to employer and employee contributions. This is good news for employees who want to strengthen their retirement funds. But a change in the contribution limit isn't necessarily a good sign for everyone. It's important to understand that the new 401(k) limit isn't a one-size-fits-all: People who have been doing their best over the years may want to add more money to their account, but it's not necessarily the best move. It is important to assess your financial situation before deciding to increase your 401(k) contribution. The new cap may be higher, but giving up is still an important part of your salary. For example, if you currently have a large amount of debt or an insufficient emergency savings account, it may be wise to put extra money into these financial areas first. After all, paying off your debt or owning a contingency fund can give you more financial security than retirement accounts in the short term. This is not to say that you should completely ignore your 401(k). If your financial situation is solid, then you should still ensure that you contribute to your retirement savings. Ideally, experts recommend saving 10% to 15% of your salary each year. If you haven't reached that goal yet, start with a smaller amount, like 3% or 5%, and try to increase it over time. You should also make sure to review your investment strategy and make any changes you deem necessary. For example, you may want to rebalance your portfolio to match your risk tolerance. It is also important to ensure that you are taking advantage of the additional tax deductions associated with your 401(k) contribution. The funds you contribute to your retirement account will be tax refunded, which means you won't have to pay taxes for them before they can be withdrawn. Finally, if you're lucky enough to have an employer offering a 401(k) match plan, make sure you take advantage of it. Doing so will allow you to maximize your retirement savings. With the new contribution limit set to take effect in 2023, now is a good time to review your retirement plan and make sure you're in the best position. Taking the time to look at your finances and making some small changes can ensure that you're ready for a successful retirement.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. unemployment rates fell slightly in December, while those for black women and Hispanic men rose significantly. The national unemployment rate fell to 6.7% in December from 6.8% in November, up from 7.4% at the beginning of the year. However, the unemployment rate for black women rose from 9.2% in November to 10.3% in December, and for Hispanic men it jumped from 7.3% to 8.3%. The unemployment rate for black men remained unchanged at 7.5%, compared with 4.3% for white men. The news is a disturbing sign for the U.S. economy, as rising unemployment in these two key demographics could put pressure on economic recovery. Neel Kashkari, president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said: \"The rise in unemployment is worrying, especially for black and Hispanic workers who are particularly hard hit by the epidemic.\" Kashkari noted that in addition to policy solutions, the government must also ensure broad access to education and training opportunities. In Minneapolis, the unemployment rate was 13.7%, while in Chicago it was 11.6% and in Washington it was 11.3%. The rise in unemployment among black women is largely attributed to the epidemic, as industries such as hospitality and leisure have been particularly affected. Moreover, the sudden shift to teleworking has resulted in many black women losing their jobs because they are often responsible for caring for children. In California, the unemployment rate was 9.2%, while in Texas it was 8.3%. Both states were above the national average. Experts believe that the increase in unemployment among Hispanic men is due to the fact that many people in this group are less educated and have higher employment rates in the service and hospitality sectors. The epidemic is a major setback for many ethnic minorities, and the rise in unemployment among black women and Hispanic men is a clear reminder of this reality. Economic recovery must take these groups into account, and policy measures must be taken to ensure that they can fully participate in the recovery. Governments need measures such as ensuring universal child care and increasing access to education and training to ensure a full recovery for these two key population groups. Moreover, businesses should be encouraged to diversify their workforces and create jobs for people of all backgrounds.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Italy's \"harmonious walnut tribe\" - a group of small farmers and landowners who have been living sustainably for centuries - may no longer need to worry about their energy supply. Thanks to the new project, communities will be able to access renewable energy without spending a single euro. The project, funded by Italian energy company Enel and Italian research institute Istituto Enel, provides solar panels for communities such as the Harmonic Walnut Tribe to generate electricity from the sun. The project also includes wind turbines, geothermal and hydraulic generators, and other sustainable sources of energy. The project is part of Enel's commitment to creating a sustainable energy future for Italy and supporting communities in remote and rural areas. The harmonious walnut tribe is located in the Abruzzo province of the Appenice Mountains and has been living on land for centuries.The village is essentially self-sufficient, relying on abundant local resources. Locals harvest walnuts, vegetables and fruits from the land, while beekeeping, sheep and goat pastures, forestry and winemaking form the basis of community livelihoods. In the past, the village relied on generators to power homes and produce electricity, but their operation and use were often difficult to obtain with high fuel costs. This meant that villagers had to rely on an unreliable supply of electricity, especially in winter. As Enel put it, \"With the installation of solar panels, harmonious walnut tribes now have access to clean and renewable energy at zero cost. Villagers will no longer need to worry about unreliable power supply, they can use the energy generated by solar panels to power their homes and produce electricity in villages.\" The project is part of Enel's larger plan to create a sustainable energy future for Italy.The company has installed solar panels and wind turbines in various regions of Italy, with the goal of eventually providing affordable clean energy to millions of people. The project also proved the resilience of harmonious walnut tribes, who managed to maintain their lifestyle and culture despite living in one of Italy's most remote areas. The project also draws attention to the power of small-scale agriculture and land owners, who have great potential to build a greener, more sustainable future if they receive the right support. As Carlo Gnerre, leader of the Harmony Nut tribe, put it: \" This project is an example of a small intervention that can bring about great change. We are a proud and resourced community which will give us the opportunity to continue living sustainably and pass on our traditions to future generations.\"", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "The Justice Department said two New York men were arrested on federal charges Tuesday for conspiring with Russians to intrude into the Kennedy International Airport taxi system. According to court documents, John McCaffrey of Queens, 54, and Mark Regan of Staten Island, 48, were accused of colluding with two Russian nationals to disrupt the computer network of a Kennedy-based taxi company and illegally obtain confidential records. The case is the latest in a series of international hacking cases in recent years, and authorities say it highlights the ongoing risks posed by foreign actors seeking to interfere with U.S. information systems. The Justice Department said the investigation into McCaffrey and Reagan began in February, when law enforcement found suspicious activity from a computer network of Kennedy International Airport taxi companies. The Department of Homeland Security has issued an alert, and an investigation revealed that the two suspects were allegedly \"looking for two Russian nationals to assist them in implementing the plan,\" the Justice Department said in a statement. The two suspects allegedly \"searched for two Russian nationals to assist them in implementing the plan,\" the Justice Department said in a statement. The statement said Russian nationals were working to \"implement the initial steps of the program in order to test the possibility of violating\" taxi company systems. The New York State Prosecutor's Office said the suspect \"attempted to gain unauthorized access to confidential passenger records and unlawful access to taxi instrumentation and metering computer systems.\" In addition, court documents show that the defendant allegedly tried to monitor credit card transactions of taxi company customers. McCaffrey and Reagan were accused of conspiring to gain access to protected computers without authorization, as well as conspiracy to commit fraud on access devices. If convicted, the defendant will face up to five years in prison for conspiracy to gain unauthorized access to a protected computer and up to 10 years in prison for conspiracy to commit access device fraud. The case was investigated by the FBI and Department of Homeland Security, and is being prosecuted in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York. \"The investigation into this crime reminds us that cybercriminals, wherever they are, cannot be exempt from prosecution in the United States and should be aware that they may be held accountable for their malicious acts,\" William F. Sweeney Jr., a special prosecutor at the FBI, said in a statement. The case is part of a Department of Homeland Security investigation focused on protecting the American people and nation's critical infrastructure from cyber-based attacks, the Justice Department said. \"Today's statement should serve as a warning that we will not allow anyone, regardless of nationality, to harm the American people by exploiting our nation's critical infrastructure and transportation systems,\" National Security Assistant Attorney General John Demers said in a statement. The announcement follows recent reports of high-profile hacking incidents involving SolarWinds computer networks and colonial pipeline cyber attacks, both of which have raised growing concerns about the threat posed by cybercrime. In a statement released Tuesday, the Justice Department said it was \"committed to prosecuting those involved in computer crime and any attempt to undermine public trust by exploiting vulnerabilities in our critical infrastructure.\" McCaffrey and Reagan will appear in federal court in Brooklyn on December 29.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), member of the House Freedom Caucus, speaks to the media after a closed-door meeting regarding Rep. Kevin McCarthy's (R-Calif.) speakership vote, on Capitol Hill in Washington, on Tuesday, Jan. 3, 2023. (Haiyun Jiang/The New York Times)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 House Republicans began their new majority rule Tuesday with a chaotic and historic debacle, an embarrassing failure to rally around a leader that showcased the difficulties they will face in performing even the basics of governing and their lack of a unifying agenda.\n\nHanded narrow control of the House by voters in November, Republicans squandered the opening hours of the new Congress they could have used to dispel concerns about their capabilities. Instead, they feuded in a disorderly display over who among them should be speaker as the most extreme elements of the new majority repeatedly rejected Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California.\n\nSign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times\n\nDespite McCarthy\u2019s prominent role in fundraising and delivering the House to Republicans and his backing among most in the party ranks, about 20 Republicans refused to support him and for the first time in a century forced repeated rounds of voting for the speakership. After three flailing attempts at electing a speaker, Republicans abruptly called for the House to be adjourned until noon Wednesday as they scrambled for a way out of their leadership morass. The stalemate meant the usually routine organization of the new House did not occur and its members were not sworn in, nor could any legislation be considered.\n\nThe paralysis underscored the dilemma facing House Republicans: No matter the concessions made to some of those on the far right, they simply will not relent and join their colleagues even if it is for the greater good of their party \u2014 and perhaps the nation. They consider themselves conservative purists who cannot be placated unless all their demands are met \u2014 and maybe not even then. Their agenda is mostly to defund, disrupt and dismantle government, not to participate in it.\n\nIt means that whoever emerges from the messy leadership fight will face deep-seated resistance when trying to shepherd spending bills and other measures that are fundamental to governance. Tuesday\u2019s spectacle reflected that House Republicans have grown more skilled at legislative sabotage than legislative success, leaving the difficult business of getting things done to others.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe rebels just don\u2019t like McCarthy, and they seem to not be able to find a way to like him,\u201d said John Feehery, a longtime Republican strategist and former top House aide. \u201cThey lack a legislative maturity to understand it can\u2019t be personal. It has to be just business.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy sought to make the conflict about something bigger than himself in an appeal to his opponents to put aside whatever feelings they had about him so Republicans could move forward.\n\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be about that you are going to leverage somebody for your own personal gain inside Congress,\u201d McCarthy told reporters. \u201cThis has to be about the country.\u201d\n\nBut the holdouts were not yet budging.\n\n\u201cI have heard nothing new from Kevin,\u201d said Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., a McCarthy foe, between rounds of votes.\n\nTo try to quell the revolt, McCarthy had already promised new rules that would open him or another figure to regular efforts to depose them from the speakership, along with requirements that would leave the leadership hamstrung and at the mercy of conservatives in trying to advance legislation.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a hard-right alternative for speaker favored by some conservatives, conceded that the legislative outlook was limited at best, considering that bills favored by House Republicans were unlikely to pass in the Democratic Senate or be signed by President Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cSo be it,\u201d Jordan said in nominating McCarthy. \u201cThey have to answer to the people in 2024.\u201d\n\nHe also alluded to what was likely to be an epic struggle to keep the government running and stave off a disastrous debt default with Republicans in charge of the House, saying that their principal task was to ensure that Congress never again passed the kind of sprawling spending bill enacted last month.\n\nThe breakdown on the House floor was the latest and most pronounced of the assaults by the hard right on its own congressional leadership in recent years. Archconservatives drove out John Boehner in 2015, denied McCarthy the votes needed to succeed Boehner at the time and complained about the stewardship of the compromise consensus choice of Paul Ryan. But Tuesday\u2019s attack was their most aggressive yet, a nationally televised implosion that showcased the intransigence and unwillingness to compromise of a segment of House Republicans at what should have been a moment of triumph.\n\nEven Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., typically a firebrand eager to stir turmoil, castigated those holding out on McCarthy because of how it reflected on the party\u2019s image.\n\n\u201cIf the base only understood that 19 Republicans voting against McCarthy are playing Russian roulette with our hard-earned Republican majority right now,\u201d Greene said on Twitter. \u201cThis is the worst thing that could possibly happen.\u201d\n\nDemocrats were enjoying the tumult to a degree but also recognized the problems it could mean down the road. Rep. Mike Quigley, a senior Democrat from Illinois, said the speaker fight was the culmination of a growing Republican ethos of \u201ctaking their ball and going home\u201d if they fail to get what they demand.\n\nOther Democrats watched in amazement as they saw Republicans open their reign with a clash that would leave whoever was eventually chosen badly undermined and the party\u2019s strength diluted from the start.\n\n\u201cWhat a weakened position they have put themselves in,\u201d marveled Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a senior Democrat from Connecticut.\n\nThe uproar in the House was in marked contrast to the opening day of the Senate, where seven new members were sworn in and senators then quietly adjourned for three weeks. While House Republicans were ensnared in a brutal internal battle, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the minority leader, was scheduled to appear alongside Biden on Wednesday to celebrate funding for a major public works project in Kentucky.\n\nAs they sought a way out of their dilemma, some Republicans acknowledged the poor message they were sending with the stalemate but also said that it was likely to be a distant memory with voters once the leadership question was resolved.\n\n\u201cJust like everything in three months that becomes small ball, it becomes insignificant,\u201d said Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo. \u201cIn a year and a half, when people are starting to think about voting again, they are not thinking about that. They are thinking about what have we accomplished. It is more important to do things than it is to have a good first impression.\u201d\n\nHis colleagues no doubt hope Buck is correct.\n\n\u00a9 2023 The New York Times Company", "label": "human"}

On the other hand, Nio delivered 25,879 cars in 2022, up from 21,241 in 2021. Xpeng is a young company founded in 2018 and listed in August 2020. The success of the company was mainly due to its G3 electric SUV and P7 electric sedan.The company's share price has risen by about 70% since it started in 2021. In 2020, Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers accounted for about 90% of all electric vehicle sales in the country. Last year, China's government set a target of five million electric vehicles by 2025, which seems to have been met. Another Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer, Li Auto, reported that it delivered 22,419 vehicles in 2022, up from 16,999 in 2021. The company also hopes to expand into other markets such as Europe and the United States. The success of these Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers shows that China is becoming a major player in the global EV market.China has become the world's largest EV market over the past few years, accounting for more than 50% of global EV sales in 2020. The success of Xu Peng, Li and other Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers also illustrates just how much the global market for electric vehicles has changed over the past few years. Companies like Tesla, once considered leaders in the market, are now struggling to keep up with competition. At present, Xpeng and other Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers are unlikely to surpass Tesla's sales and market share in the short term. But the success of these companies does indicate that China's electric vehicle market is growing and becoming more competitive.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "2nd year The popular streaming platform and hardware maker Roku announced today that it will start producing its own TVs from 2021. This move is part of the company's strategy to become a larger player in the streaming world, and demonstrates its ambition to compete with Samsung, Sony and other major TV manufacturers. Roku CEO Anthony Wood announced the news in an investor speech. He noted that the new TVs will be \"full\" of features, which means they will have built-in access to the company's streaming services, as well as other features not yet disclosed by the company. Roku currently provides hardware in the form of media boxes and streaming sticks, but these devices do not contain all the features on a smart TV.

{"text": "Friday was a busy day for analysts, with dozens of companies affected by upgrades, downgrades and changes in price targets. The most closely watched stocks include Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Chevron (CVX), Boeing (BA), Netflix (NFLX). Apple Inc., 2003-2004 According to the company, Apple is expected to benefit from strong demand for new products such as the iPhone 12 series and the Apple Watch Series 6. Moreover, analysts believe that the company's services and wearables business will remain robust, and Apple's financial results may be much better than Wall Street's current estimates. UBS analysts, on the other hand, lowered Apple's price target from $215 to $205, citing weak Chinese demand. UBS warned that this could lead to a \"significant\" mistake in the company's next earnings report. Category: Companies based in Amazonia Amazon (AMZN) received several calls on Friday, including a bullish call from Citigroup, which raised its price target to $4,000 from $3,800 and maintained its \"buy\" rating. According to the company, Amazon is expected to achieve long-term growth as it continues to expand into new markets and benefit from increasing scale. Analysts at UBS, on the other hand, lowered Amazon's price target from $3,800 to $3,700 and maintained a \"neutral\" rating. While Amazon's e-commerce business has been strong, UBS said its cloud business is performing poorly. Chevron Company Goldman Sachs analysts began reporting on Chevron (CVX) Friday, rated \"neutral\" with a price target of $90. According to the company, Chevron has a solid foundation and benefited from last year's recovery in oil prices. Boeing Corporation, Inc. Jefferies analysts began reporting on Boeing (BA) Friday, rated \"poor performance\" with a price target of $215. According to the company, Boeing faces significant challenges in the 737 MAX project, which could lead to further delays in delivery and higher than expected production costs. Jefferies also warned that Boeing's current earnings forecast may be overly optimistic. Netflix, Inc. Susquehanna analysts launched an \"positive\" rating on Netflix (NFLX) Friday, with a target price of $615. According to the company, Netflix's strong competitive position in the streaming space and its large and growing content base give it a significant advantage. Susquehanna also noted that Netflix's move to produce more original content helped it gain market share and could continue to raise its share price.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "It's a story that sounds like a science fiction movie: A fire at a dairy plant in Wisconsin causes melted butter to block a canal running through Oshkosh. But that's not the Hollywood episode - it's a very real emergency, with emergency workers appearing at the scene hours after a fire in an ex-farm dairy plant before midnight on January 4, 2023. According to a statement from Foremost Farms, the fire started in a cold storage room and spread rapidly. Although the fire was extinguished within minutes of its onset and there were no reports of injuries, the molten butter stored in the room caused huge blockage as the Fox River passed through Oshkosh. While the cause of the fire is still under investigation, officials say it may be related to the age of the building and its equipment. The melting butter and the resulting blockage turned out to be a major headache for authorities, who had to scramble to prevent an already crowded river from spilling over their banks. First responders on the scene quickly realized that they were facing more than just a typical fire: they had to act quickly to mitigate the effects of butter, which had begun to cool in cold Wisconsin air. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources was asked for help, and they mobilized a task force to manage the situation. A team of experts from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers also arrived to assist, whose expertise has proven invaluable. The team used a heavy vacuum pump to pull the molten butter out of the canal, then used sandbags to contain dirt to prevent it from entering the river, thus preventing the river from overflowing. Then they cleared the debris on the shore with a bulldozer. The whole incident lasted more than three hours, and the butter was eventually pumped back into the facility's storage room, which is expected to be properly handled. Although the fire may have caused significant damage, experts say it could have been worse. Fortunately, a quick response from local and federal officials prevented the event from turning into a serious environmental disaster. \"The fire at the most recent farm dairy plant was an unfortunate event that could have more serious consequences,\" said John Tanski, Mayor of Oshkosh. \"I thank the rescue team for working quickly and effectively to prevent a bigger environmental problem, and I also thank no one who was injured.\" The swift response from local and federal officials prevented the incident from becoming a bigger problem. Although the factory remained closed pending repair, the community could take a breath of solace to avoid potential disaster.", "label": "machine"}

CFOTO | Future Publishing | Getty Images\n\nOne analyst maintains a bullish outlook on Apple despite shares of the tech giant falling to their lowest since June 2021 amid continued iPhone supply concerns. \"Apple is the biggest U.S. name out there, and we think it is a lot more headline risks than anything else,\" Angelo Zino, senior industry analyst at CFRA Research, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" on Wednesday. A headline risk is the risk that a company's share price will decline from negative news coverage. Apple shares fell to their lowest level since June 2021 as iPhone production is under threat from a widespread Covid outbreak in China after the country exited its zero-Covid policy.\n\nLoading chart...\n\nThe outbreak could potentially cause worker shortages at component plants or assembly factories across the country. For the last two months, Apple has already been grappling with production shortages. In November, iPhone 14 production was hit by Covid-19 restrictions and labor protests at its primary iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max assembly plant in Zhengzhou, China. Last week, a JPMorgan Chase analyst said that the supply shortfall should continue through the end of the year and weigh on the typical seasonal upshot in volumes. Apple had warned on Nov. 6 of a \"significant disruption\" ahead of the holiday season.\n\n\"While the rapid extension of lead times for the iPhone 14 Pro/Pro Max has slowed down and in fact began to moderate in recent weeks, it still remains elevated relative to the lead times seen prior to the COVID outbreak in Zhengzhou,\" said Samik Chatterjee, in a note to investors. \"Ultimately, Apple is going to do everything they possibly can to defend their business as long as they can across different geographical regions,\" said Zino. He further added that the actual impact to the top line is going to be less than 1% in the U.S. and Europe. Despite shortages, many analysts predicted that Apple customers will continue to be loyal to the brand's products.\n\nwatch now", "label": "human"}

{"text": ".. On New Year's Eve, Dana White, president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), was shot by his wife Zivile Raudoniene during a live broadcast on ESPN. The fight was captured by multiple camera crews and became the focus of major media controversy. The live broadcast of the UFC Fight Night 229 tournament was shown on ESPN at around 8:30 p.m. on December 31, 2021. The broadcast included two championship matches, including a match between the two biggest players in the sport: UFC heavyweight champion Dana White and challenger Zivile Raudoniene. As the two fighters stood together, White reached out to beat his opponent. No one expected that White's whipping would make his wife unwary, not his intended target. Witnesses at the scene said the stabbing shook Rawdonien's knee and caused her to fall to the ground. According to several sources, White immediately tried to help her get up and apologize for her mistake. Shortly after, the video of the incident spread rapidly online, sparking a media fire. Social media users quickly criticized White's behavior, although it was clear that White intended to beat his opponent instead of his wife. The UFC quickly responded by suspending White and investigating the matter. White issued a statement to the press, claiming that the incident was an accident and apologizing for any pain or discomfort he caused. There are also concerns that the incident could have a long-term impact on White's career. While it is not clear whether the UFC will take further action, this situation certainly puts the future of White's involvement in the organization into question. The incident is the latest in a series of public relations disasters that have plagued the organization. UFC recently issued a statement condemning the incident and vowing to take all necessary measures to ensure the safety and well-being of participants. The incident has led many to question the UFC's approach to domestic violence, especially since the organization has consistently denied any wrongdoing. White's actions have also been the subject of international discussion, with some arguing that the incident suggests a bigger problem for the movement. It is not clear when or if he will return to UFC and the mixed martial arts movement. Until then, the event will continue to be a major topic among fans, journalists and athletes.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".. If you're like most people, you know that the start of the new year is a good time to make decisions. But this year, why not focus on your finances? Now do some small changes to your money habits that will have a big impact on your finances by the end of the year. To help you get started, here are five financial resolutions to consider making in 2021. 1. Budgeting and sticking to it Create a budget is one of the most effective ways to track spending and save money, it doesn't have to be complicated either. List your sources of income and all your expenses first. This can include recurring costs such as rents and utilities, or nonessential items like dining out and streaming services. Once everything is listed, compare how much each month goes in and out. 2. Establishment of the contingency fund Reserve funds for unexpected expenses can help you avoid taking on debt or relying on high-interest credit cards. Ideally, you should deposit your living expenses for 3 to 6 months in a contingency fund, but any amount is better than none. Even if you reserve only a small amount per month, this will accumulate over time. 3. Repayment of obligations Start with credit cards and medical bills to car loans and student loans, then develop a plan to address these issues, taking into account the interest rates, amounts owed, and repayment schedules for each issue. Once you've established the order in which you want to pay off, focus on paying at least the least amount of all debt while paying extra money to the one with the highest interest rate. Increase Your Retirement Savings If your employer offers a retirement savings plan like 401(k), consider signing up and taking advantage of any corresponding benefits. If you have already paid, consider increasing your contributions each year. 5.Protect Your Identity In today's world, identity theft is a real threat. Protecting yourself means taking steps such as regularly checking your credit reports and being particularly vigilant about keeping your personal and financial information secure. Make sure your password is strong, and investing in identity theft protection can also help. A few simple changes to your money habits this year can help you get closer to your financial goals and have a safer financial future. Whether it's raising your budget, paying off debt, or increasing your retirement savings, even a small solution will make a big difference in your finances.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The Chinese government's decades-long strategy to dominate global technology is on its way to success. Just a year ago, Chinese tech companies became household names in the United States and Europe, establishing outposts in Silicon Valley, winning massive mergers and acquisitions, and transforming their domestic technology markets. But China's dream of becoming the world's most powerful tech superpower has been hit hard. After years of investing and focusing on innovation, China is now facing a crisis of confidence. The U.S. Trump administration launched an attack this year on Chinese tech companies, restricting their access to the U.S. market and cutting off their supply chains. The European Union has followed suit by imposing restrictions on Chinese technology companies and their investments in Europe. Investment has dried up, and tech companies have been forced to scale back their operations. The government's own ambitious technology-driven social control program was frustrated, leading to widespread rebounds and accusations of censorship and human rights abuses. At the same time, China's technological ambitions have been complicated by a trade war with the United States. Tariff escalation has had a negative impact on its economy, and ongoing trade tensions have hampered China's ability to obtain critical technology from U.S. suppliers. As a result, China's once vibrant tech industry is at a crossroads. The Chinese government now has to rethink its strategy as it tries to find a way to ensure that its technology sector continues to grow and remain competitive on the global stage. One of the key challenges is to ensure that Chinese technology companies remain competitive in an increasingly hostile international environment. China is now seeking to use its domestic market to help maintain momentum in its tech sector. At the same time, China is seeking to deepen its relations with other countries in the region, has signed a number of technical cooperation agreements with Asian countries and is negotiating new markets for developing Chinese technology with other countries in the region. The Chinese government is also trying to address some criticism of its technological ambitions by taking steps to improve the domestic regulatory environment. It is trying to introduce more transparency and accountability in the technology sector, and is taking steps to curb corruption and abuse. But despite all of China's positive steps, the fundamental challenge remains: How can China remain competitive in a global environment where technological ambitions are increasingly under attack? Only time will tell if China's technology strategy can succeed in the long run. But for now, it is clear that China's ambitious plans to dominate global science and technology are facing serious problems.", "label": "machine"}

The true tests of the functionality of a Republican majority, Donovan said, would be the must-pass items like funding the government and the debt limit. Indeed, the vast majority of House Republicans voted against an omnibus spending bill that skated through the Senate on a bipartisan basis just last month.

Often, companies say they can expand with the speed of a tech company, but then run into the realities of this labor-intensive industry. They end up needing more providers than they can find.\n\nHo said it's the right time for real technology startups to take off in healthcare. We're finally at a point where certain tools, from robotics to computer vision, are maturing enough to be applied to care delivery. Five years ago that wasn't the case, she said.\n\nThat's going to require digital-health investing to change, Ho said.\n\n\"It's no longer about access \u2014 it's about actually using technology that exists today to fundamentally change the unit economics of delivering care,\" she said.\n\nOne example could be Conceivable Life Sciences, an ACME portfolio company in the early stages, she said. It's aiming to use robots and software to cut down on human work in embryology labs.\n\nThat could make in vitro fertilization less expensive and less subject to human error, Ho said.\n\nBrightside Health, another ACME investment, does online psychiatry with help from an internal-diagnostic assistant that uses machine learning to help providers diagnose patients so they can take on more patients without sacrificing quality, Ho said.\n\n\"So instead of just business-model innovation, I'm looking for tech innovation,\" Ho said. \"It's not just, 'Let's put it on the internet.'\"\n\nHardcore nerds will win\n\nThe need for more impactful technology in healthcare is changing how Ho assesses founding teams, she said.\n\nGeneralized-tech entrepreneurs already struggle in digital health because there are so many \"weird\" idiosyncrasies within the healthcare system that make no sense, she said. At the same time, many founders understand those idiosyncrasies, but aren't technically savvy, she said.\n\n\"And I think those people are gonna get left behind in the dust,\" Ho said.\n\nSo the space's next winners are going to be hardcore nerds, Ho said. She's looking for founding teams with three distinct superpowers: understanding the healthcare landscape, understanding the technology behind products, and understanding that technology's clinical application.\n\n\"I think the next five to 10 years of digital-health investing \u2014 the people who are gonna do really well are gonna be the nerds,\" Ho said.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "It's hard to believe that just a year ago, we were all eagerly looking forward to the release of a new generation of video game consoles. We were attracted by the promise of cutting-edge graphics, an immersive experience and all the latest devices. Fast forward to the end of 2022, and we're seeing a huge shift in the video game landscape, with an emphasis on gaming as well as a massive influx of new games. To celebrate the end of this year and the start of new devices, let's take a look at some of the best games we've got this year, and some that we can't do without. The top headset of the year is Oculus Quest 2, a completely independent wireless headset that combines two of the world's best products - high-end PC games and affordable portable mobile games. With improved resolution, better design and audio improvements, Quest 2 brings VR to the masses in an unprecedented way. Another major gaming device launched this year is the release of the PS5 and Xbox Series X. Both consoles are powerful, full of features, and perform better than previous ones. In particular, the Xbox Series X has some impressive features such as 4K 120Hz games, fast resumes, and light tracking. The PS5 is also very powerful, with a custom CPU and GPU along with ultra-high speed solid state drives. Another major release this year is the launch of the next generation of gaming monitors, with the best being Asus ROG Swift PG259QN, a 32-inch game display with ultra HD 4K resolution and an impressive 400Hz refresh rate. The display is particularly popular among highly competitive players, offering smooth frame rates and chin visuals. One of the most popular keyboards is Razer Huntsman Elite, a fully customizable RGB mechanical keyboard with removable wrist rest, dedicated media controls and state-of-the-art optical switches that offer unparalleled accuracy. In the mouse sector, we saw the launch of Razer Viper Ultimate, a fully functional gaming mouse with up to 20,000 frames maximum, significant response time of 0.2 milliseconds, and eight programmable buttons for final customization. When it comes to final customization, the list of game equipment in 2022 will not be complete without mentioning the gaming chair. We have seen the launch of the DXRacer RS57 with a smooth modern design, adjustable back and built-in waist support pads, as well as noble Epic series chairs with a durable PU leather appearance, adjustable arm frames and a maximum straight angle of 135 degrees. Finally, a new piece of equipment that we can't do without is the Logitech G Pro X Superlight wireless gaming mouse. The mouse is designed to provide players with the ultimate balance of comfort, performance and style. It is very light, weighs only 74 grams while still having an optical sensor of 16,000 dpi and a delay of 1 millisecond. From the most cutting edge gaming consoles to high-end headphones to ultra lightweight wireless mouse, there's a lot of amazing game equipment releases in 2022 that we can all enjoy right now. Hopefully over the next few years we will continue to see more great games released.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "About the Trump rioters. Hope Hicks, a once popular assistant to Ivanka Trump and an outstanding figure on President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, reportedly attacked the tweet of model Karlie Kloss about a mob of Trump supporters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6. Politico has reported notable revelations of party quarrels and posted an article on the internet Kloss in the days following congressional violence. The article, titled \"Accepting the results of legitimate democratic elections is patriotic,\" sparked a response from Hicks, beyond kindness. According to an email obtained by the news media, Hicks sent an email to senior White House staff urging them to stop defending the model's tweet. \"We need to fix this now,\" she reportedly wrote in the email. The emails were sent after Kloss asked Trump to condemn the violence, showing Hicks' steadfastness, writing: \"There is no middle ground here. She must apologize and confirm the legitimacy of the election result or she must resign.\" The emails, which were sent on Jan. 9, reflect a week-long struggle between the two sides that included Kloss responding to those who disagreed with her position. The conflict between Hicks and Clos dates back to 2017, when campaign adviser Hicks encouraged Clos to leave her former fiance Joshua Kushner as his family's support for the president put them in trouble. Clos makes no apologies for the actions of Trump supporters, and she has never apologized or retreated from a tweet. Despite their differences, Clos and Kushner have now married and welcomed their first child. The email showed Hicks that Klos's comments were inappropriate and could be seen as a \"betrayal\" of Ivanka Trump. Hicks was reportedly a close friend of Ivanka and is often seen as \"Ivanka's propagandist\" in the White House. With emails showing deep hostility between the two sides, a once-close relationship between Kloss and Trump appears to be in danger. While the email didn't reveal the final outcome of the dispute, it appears Kloss has stuck to his position while Hicks continues to defend the former First Family. It's not clear whether the two will make a correction, but emails show Hicks is determined to ensure that Cross pays for her position on Trump.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Los conflictos laborales no han cesado para Inditex con el acuerdo alcanzado con sus dependientas de la provincia de La Coru\u00f1a.\n\nLos sindicatos UGT y CCOO han anunciado que el pr\u00f3ximo 25 de enero comenzar\u00e1 la mesa de negociaci\u00f3n con la multinacional para \"abordar medidas globales que afecten a todas las tiendas y marcas del grupo a nivel estatal\".\n\nEsta decisi\u00f3n llega, explican fuentes sindicales de UGT, tras las advertencias al grupo textil de que \"el efecto contagio y de conflictividad\" tras lo acontecido en Galicia podr\u00eda replicarse en otros territorios: \"Ahora tienen un problema y esto se va a trasladar al resto de Espa\u00f1a\", explican.\n\nVIDEO Manifestaci\u00f3n trabajadores Inditex A Coru\u00f1a\n\nEsta mesa, de hecho, nace tras la decisi\u00f3n de UGT de enviar puntos concretos a la multinacional, aprovechando las mesas de negociaci\u00f3n que tienen abiertas con la compa\u00f1\u00eda.\n\nEntre estos puntos, aparece el plan igualdad conjunto, donde se deben de tratar medidas de alcance y aplicaci\u00f3n en todas las marcas. Una lucha que ya relataron las trabajadoras de Galicia, quienes denunciaban un agravio comparativo frente al resto de empleados de otras divisiones.\n\nOtro asunto, probablemente el m\u00e1s sensible, es la intenci\u00f3n de reformar el sistema de comisiones del personal de tiendas con la premisa de \"garantizar un impacto significativo en la retribuci\u00f3n de las plantillas\". Fuentes sindicales explican que se busca que se contemple el impacto la inflaci\u00f3n en el poder adquisitivo con f\u00f3rmulas que \"no s\u00f3lo eviten esa p\u00e9rdida, sino que la mejoren\".\n\n\"No puede cobrar lo mismo una trabajadora de Inditex que de una mercer\u00eda local\", explicitan.\n\nEsta \u00faltima premisa se suma al acuerdo logrado a nivel estatal hace unos meses entre UGT y CCOO, en el que ya se logr\u00f3 recuperar el incentivo de dependientes en todo el grupo, aumentando su cuant\u00eda a 1.000 euros a abonar en la n\u00f3mina de febrero de 2023.\n\n\"Naomi Campbell, \u00bfd\u00f3nde est\u00e1?\": as\u00ed se est\u00e1 viviendo la huelga de las dependientas de Inditex de La Coru\u00f1a, la \"m\u00e1s masiva\" de su historia\n\nEl punto discordante, explican fuentes sindicales a Business Insider Espa\u00f1a, es que esta cuant\u00eda se \"queda corta\" porque el compromiso de Inditex es hacerla efectiva este pr\u00f3ximo a\u00f1o. Es decir, no hay un acuerdo para asegurarla en los pr\u00f3ximos ejercicios.\n\nDe fondo tambi\u00e9n la intenci\u00f3n de impulsar los convenios colectivos provinciales que est\u00e1n paralizados \u2014alguno desde hace m\u00e1s de 10 a\u00f1os\u2014, lo que en la pr\u00e1ctica implica el congelamiento de los salarios de las personas afectadas.\n\nCon todo, el incendio laboral en Galicia ha cesado pero no as\u00ed en Madrid, donde la CGT adelant\u00f3 a este medio que ir\u00e1 finalmente a huelga el pr\u00f3ximo 7 de enero.\n\nAs\u00ed, y si nada lo impide, los dependientes de tienda de Zara, Lefties, Pull and Bear y Kiddy's Class tendr\u00e1 su particular spin off laboral en la capital de Espa\u00f1a.\n\nPor qu\u00e9 el cisma sindical en Inditex no ha terminado\n\nFuentes sindicales sostienen que desde CCOO no se ha gestado la iniciaci\u00f3n de esta mesa sindical, pese a sumarse ahora a ella, tal y como recoge un comunicado hecho p\u00fablico hoy.\n\nEn ella, sostienen que \"las pasadas semanas desde CCOO \u2013y de forma coordinada con UGT\u2013 han planteado a Inditex formalizar este encuentro\". Algo que otra voces echan por tierra.\n\nDe hecho, no es la primera vez que queda patente la lucha sindical que nace alrededor de la multinacional textil.\n\nDesde la CIG, el sindicato mayoritario en Galicia del grupo, ya denunciaron que CCOO se mantuvo de perfil durante el conflicto e, incluso \u2014sostienen\u2014 tuvo un papel desmovilizador en las sucesivas huelgas que finalmente cristalizaron en una mejora sindical para los trabajadores de tienda.\n\nTanto es as\u00ed que el cisma sindical vivi\u00f3 su punto m\u00e1s \u00e1lgido con un sorpresivo acuerdo firmado de forma estatal por UGT y CCOO, con el que UGT de A Coru\u00f1a mostr\u00f3 su desacuerdo y, por ello, la batalla sigui\u00f3 hasta llegar a la posici\u00f3n actual.\n\nDe hecho, el responsable estatal de UGT en Inditex, Alvaro Cajigal, hizo menci\u00f3n en un reciente comunicado que Comisiones Obreras no se sum\u00f3 a las movilizaciones, entendiendo tal y como dijo, que el acuerdo estatal era suficiente.\n\nAhora, parece que la posturas son otras y, en su comunicado, CCOO valora positivamente la concreci\u00f3n de esta mesa para comenzar 2023 \"avanzando, de forma significativa, en todas las marcas y territorios con presencia de Inditex\".", "label": "human"}
{"text": "In the early hours of New Year's Day 2023, Russian troops stationed in Ukraine were attacked by an unidentified attacker that occurred around 3 a.m. local time in the eastern Ukrainian city of Lucansk. Preliminary reports from the scene of the attack indicated that at least three Russian soldiers had been injured by automatic rifle fire; however, the Ukrainian authorities have not confirmed the identity of the attackers or the nature of the incident. The incident has already sparked a debate about the security of Ukraine's and Russia's borders, especially given the current tension between the two countries.This article will briefly outline our current understanding of the attack. What's going on? On 1 January, at around 3 a.m., an unidentified attacker opened fire on a military post in Luhansk, Ukraine, which injured three Russian soldiers and was subsequently described by the Ukrainian authorities as an act of terrorism. The attacker was believed to have used an automatic rifle, and his identity or whereabouts were not disclosed in any detail.In response to the attack, the Government of Ukraine ordered the closure of all security checkpoints along the Ukrainian-Russian border. After the attack, Russian authorities expressed concern about the security situation in eastern Ukraine, suggesting that the attack could be part of a larger operation targeting Russian forces in the region. 2006/15. Responses to the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (E/CN.4/Sub.2/2007/8) In a statement issued shortly after the attack, the Government of Ukraine condemned the violence and called for an investigation into it, while the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine also claimed that its security forces had been highly vigilant against any attempt to destabilize the region. Russia also expressed indignation at the attack, which President Vladimir Putin described as \"barbaric and totally unacceptable.\" In a statement released shortly after the incident, the Kremlin called for a thorough investigation of the attack and warned it would \"take all necessary measures to ensure the safety of its citizens\". The UN Security Council issued a statement expressing \"grave concern\" about the attack and calling for a \"quick, independent and transparent investigation\" into the incident. Influences 1984-2005 The Russian military's New Year's Eve attack in Ukraine has raised concerns about security in the region, as well as the possibility of a further escalation of tension between the two countries. The Ukraine-Russia border has been a source of controversy for several years, and the attack will only increase the likelihood of further violence in the region. It is not clear how this incident will be resolved or what impact it will have on both countries. But one thing is certain: this incident further exacerbates relations between Ukraine and Russia, and increases the risk of any potential military conflict in the region. The two countries may seek a diplomatic solution, but this attack could serve as a reminder of the increasingly volatile security situation in eastern Ukraine.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".. Now it's late November, and Wall Street's focus is on the political drama that took place in Washington after the midterm elections. As lawmakers scramble to take control of the House, investors can expect to see a post-medium stock market rally, but if basic economic data suggests an increase in inflation and a possible recession, then it could stand still. Stock markets have been doing well since the midterm elections. But this time, fears of inflation and recession are likely to dampen optimism, making post-medium gains more calm than usual. The consumer price index, a key indicator of inflation, has been rising steadily this year and is now at two-year highs. Core inflation - which eliminates volatile food and energy costs - has also risen in recent months, reaching five-year highs. The yield curve has also flattened in recent months, indicating that the market expects economic growth to slow. The reverse yield curve is often seen as a precursor to an economic recession because it suggests investors are increasingly worried about future growth prospects. The Fed has been raising interest rates, making it more expensive for businesses and consumers to borrow. While higher rates help curb inflation, they can also slow economic growth by allowing companies to hire workers, buy new equipment, or expand business costs. The central bank has been keeping a close eye on the economy, and is expected to continue gradually raising interest rates to keep inflation under control. However, if the Fed raises rates too quickly, it could push the economy into recession. The midterm elections, seen as a referendum on the first two years of President Donald Trump's presidency, have resulted in Democrats and Republicans splitting Congress. With lawmakers divided over key issues, it may be difficult to pass legislation that stimulates economic growth. All of these factors could lead to a more calm post-midterm stock market recovery. Before deciding whether the bull market is intact or whether the rally has ended, investors will look at how economic data will play out in the coming months. The economic picture is far from clear, but it's certain that any mid-term post-rebound will be affected by inflation and recession concerns. Investors should pay attention to Washington's economic data and politics in the coming weeks or months, as both will play a significant role in determining the strength of the stock market rally.", "label": "machine"}

Hold that thought while I make sure those readers who still carry cash are following along.\n\n\u201cAI\u201d stands for \u201cartificial intelligence.\u201d It\u2019s the same collection of circuits that makes a calculator work, but complicated enough to mimic human thought, supposedly.\n\nIf you assume AI is a long way from affecting daily professional journalism, you weren\u2019t looking closely at Friday\u2019s column, about medical decisions.

Finding nothing close, I looked at my own photos of hospitals. Busy and grim. I tried the Library of Congress and the Metropolitan Museum of Art banks of public domain images. Nothing. Twenty minutes of fruitless searching. Then I sighed, jumped onto Dall-E, the graphic AI provider, and created a free, useable image in about 10 seconds.\n\nDid I have qualms? Sure. Primarily that our excellent human staff photographers would notice and hate me quietly in their hearts. But my primary directive is to do what is necessary to improve the final product. Nobody seemed to notice.\n\nWould I someday use Jasper to craft a more felicitous phrase? Why not? I use a thesaurus if I can\u2019t immediately put my finger on the right term. I use a dictionary. For the top of my column today, I cribbed from my 1930 copy of \u201cMoby Dick,\u201d which is basically what AI does.\n\nA lot of creativity is judicious borrowing. The lady in the Jasper video might find \u201cThe perfect pair of socks is like a hug for your feet\u201d an epiphany, but a skeptical real live journalist who plugs that phrase into Google discovers plenty of footwear companies \u2014Crocks, Bombas, UGG slippers \u2014 have used that exact phrase for years. What Jasper does is take what you\u2019re looking for, scour the internet, hoover up a bunch of old work, mash it together, then spit it back at you.\n\nA person could do that (and does \u2014 \u201ctragically defunct\u201d is used by Nicholson Baker in his novel \u201cThe Mezzanine\u201d). Graphic artists complain that while Dall-E doesn\u2019t rip off any particular work, it forms a pastiche by processing millions of images and patching together variations on a theme. That also is not new: There was a guy at the Tribune who read a lot of Mike Royko columns, then spent the rest of his career regurgitating a pale facsimile of Royko\u2019s style. Can we really fault technology for being as derivative as people are? (Not to mention as racist. The three doctors that Dall-E served up were all white; a problem with AI generators. At first, the criminals Dall-E served up were usually Black).\n\nIs this important? Maybe caring whether something is original or not is very 20th century of me. Why not use AI to wipe the fingerprints off your plagiarism? Heck, why read anything at all when you can slide onto Instagram and spend 15 minutes or an hour or two watching snippets of \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d intercut with astounding car crashes and Jenna Ortega dancing to \u201cGoo Goo Muck\u201d?\n\nThe answer, I think, is that being a human is difficult, or at least challenging, and takes effort, imagination and integrity. Or should. Given how bad humans are at being human, often, despite 100,000 years of beta testing, we shouldn\u2019t expect machines to come close anytime soon.\n\nUntil then, times change, and we change with them. I tried to sign up for Jasper, but they want $82 a month for \u201cEverything in Starter plan + powerful tools for writing full length content (like blog posts) with added control & flexibility.\u201d I bet Jasper wrote that one. Maybe later. For now, Sassbook AI Headline Generator, like Dall-E, or your corner drug dealer, gives away free samples. I plugged the beginning of this column into Sassbook and it offered me the headline: \u201cMoby Dick: \u2018Jasper\u2019 is a robot that makes blog posts 10x faster.\u201d Completely wrong.\n\nI bet I can come up with something far better, and as long as that\u2019s true, I have at least a fraying thread of job security to hang from. As for \u201cMoby Dick,\u201d it\u2019s quite a good book, despite a fixation on whaling and nothing about Jasper. I recommend reading it while people, you know, still read stuff.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Where does cryptocurrency go from here after the spectacular collapse of FTX? After its launch in 2018, the industry is excited that FTX has become a giant in the world of digital assets, a platform for speculators and token traders to buy, sell and trade digital currencies, tokens and fiat currencies. Then, almost as quickly as the rise, the FTX exploded. In a shocking move in early December, the exchange announced its closure on the grounds of \"continuing losses.\" Its demise became a warning story for cryptocurrency investors and a reminder that the industry was still full of risk. But while the FTX outbreak is still resounding in the crypto world, the industry is looking to the future. Where does cryptocurrency come from? FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried announced that the company was bankrupt, triggering a domino effect in which other FTX-related companies had to make difficult decisions about its future. For example, Deribit, a derivatives exchange supported by the Fx, announced it would stop trading and Wave Financial, a decentralized exchange, announced it would move its business to another exchange platform. Despite the setbacks experienced by the FTX and its investors, the cryptocurrency market as a whole performed strongly in 2020. Bitcoin, the most well-known cryptocurrency, has had an especially brilliant year, jumping from about $7,000 at the start of the year to a record high of more than $27,000 at the beginning of December. Cryptocurrencies have become an increasingly mainstream investment asset, and institutional investors are beginning to invest in the sector. This capital inflow is partly due to increased awareness of the industry's potential as well as continued development of the technology that underpins this asset class. At the same time, regulators and governments have begun to pay more attention to the cryptocurrency industry. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently announced that it will begin regulating digital assets, but details of how this will be implemented have not been released. Despite the challenges that remain, the digital asset market is still evolving and will certainly be a high-profile area in the coming years. As the industry continues to grow and mature, it may become a more secure place for investors and traders. The future of the industry looks bright as regulatory clarity improves and technology continues to innovate. Cryptocurrency may be a relatively new asset class, but its promise is real - if managed properly, it could become a major source of value in the coming years.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "From the Senate After a series of recent disputes, senior Republican congressman John McCain has argued that it's time for new Senator George Santos (R-NY) to consider stepping down. In an interview with CNN on Wednesday, longtime Arizona Sen. McCain said he was \"very worried\" about reports that Santos had fallen into a moral scandal in his first year in office. \"The cloud of suspicion surrounding Senator Santos is growing, and I think it's time for him to seriously consider whether he should continue in office,\" McCain said. The controversy began last month when the New York Times reported that Santos had accepted tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from two defense contractors in exchange for their access to U.S. military bases and other resources. Santos initially denied any wrongdoing and insisted that the donation had been properly disclosed. But this week, the Times posted an email showing Santos has asked its staff to look into ways to offer preferential treatment to defense contractors. The emails triggered calls from congressional Democrats and watchdog groups for Santos to resign or face a moral investigation. Santos later apologized for his actions and vowed \"full cooperation\" with any investigation. But McCain says that's not enough. He believes Santos should be held accountable for his actions, and resigning may be the best way to do it. \"I know it's a tough decision for him and his family, but sometimes the best course of action is the hardest,\" McCain said. The scandal has thrown Senate Republicans into trouble. The party is struggling to maintain its majority and hold power in the House of Representatives, which could mean a costly special election if Santos is forced to resign, as well as losing control of the Senate. In the long run, it is unclear how this scandal will develop. But in the short term, McCain's rhetoric could have a significant impact on the political landscape. As Santos' support waned, Republicans were increasingly under pressure to pull him out. If Santos did step down, it could give Democrats a chance to gain an advantage in the Senate. In a statement Wednesday, Santos said he was \"deeply sorry\" for his actions but vowed to stay in office and \"continue fighting for the people of New York.\" Only time will tell how this scandal will be resolved. But for now, Senator Santos' tenure in the Senate is clearly in serious danger.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Only a handful of women have successfully merged high fashion and the American frontier: TV cowgirl Dale Evans and her signature white boots, Dolly Parton\u2019s hand-embroidered Nudie Cohn suits, Beyonc\u00e9 in a black Stetson hat. In 1998, country-pop singer Shania Twain left her mark on Western wear with a hooded leopard one-piece in the \u201cThat Don\u2019t Impress Me Much\u201d music video. The catsuit launched a thousand halloween costumes and a fervor for blends of caramels, browns, and blacks that hasn\u2019t waned since. Twain has worn leopard print on album covers, talk-show appearances, and even during her \u201cLet\u2019s Go!\u201d Las Vegas residency. For the singer, one of the best things about being a woman\u2014besides the prerogative to have a little fun\u2014is wearing leopard print with abandon. \u201c[It\u2019s] my neutral,\u201d she explains.\n\nIn this month\u2019s Clothes of Our Lives column, we are celebrating all things Cowgirl Couture with Twain, who has new music out later this month and an album due in 2023. Below, in her own words, she takes us inside her long-standing relationship with leopard print, explains why the latest Western fashion cycle is \u201csexy,\u201d and reveals her personal fashion motto. When Twain walked in the room for our interview, she had on\u2014what else?\u2014a fabulous black and blue leopard-print jumpsuit. Let\u2019s go girls.\n\nSome people say \u201cwhite is my neutral\u201d or \u201cblack is my neutral.\u201d For me, leopard print is my neutral. When I first started shooting music videos at the very beginning of my career, I would gravitate to all the leopard print options on the rack during the styling process. I just felt like it was the no-fail neutral that I could wear with anything. You can dress it up, you can dress it down. It is a staple print because you can put leopard on velvet or chiffon or sheer or silk. Anything. It\u2019s hyper flexible.\n\n\n\nMy most famous leopard-print outfit is probably the \u201cThat Don\u2019t Impress Me Much\u201d catsuit, which was based on a fabric that [fashion designer] Marc Bouwer had in his showroom. It was a stretch velvet. I fell in love with the way it moved. When you\u2019re running around and dancing and jumping and doing quick changes, your outfit has got to be durable. I never want to feel restricted when I\u2019m performing. So it starts with comfort. It always does with me. Whatever I\u2019m going to wear on stage, it has to be comfortable.\n\nSo I said to Marc, \u201cLet\u2019s go with midriff\u2014oh, and I like a flare leg.\u201d Getting the outfit together for \u201cThat Don\u2019t Impress Me Much\u201d was very collaborative. I knew we were going to be shooting out in the desert, so I needed to be comfortable for 12 hours standing on my feet. That meant platforms and layers so that I could take my jacket off to cool down.\n\nShania Twain (left) on her \u201cNow\u201d tour and (right) in the \u201cThat Don\u2019t Impress Me Much\u201d music video. Getty Images\n\nMore recently, I wore leopard print on my \u201cNow\u201d tour. Essentially, I took it from warm gold tones to black and white. I wanted the dress to be glamorous for the stage, flowing, and easy to wear. Even though it looks like a gown, it\u2019s actually sporty. Under the dress was a matching stretch bodysuit that allowed me to move around and be very flexible. [It was] still glamorous, but gave me room to dance and move and jump around. It served a purpose. The design was deliberate for that reason. I wanted the feeling of a trench coat, like in the \u201cThat Don\u2019t Impress Me Much\u201d video. Now that I think about it, I should have put a hood on it! Maybe I\u2019ll do a different one in another color and put a hood on that one.\n\nI\u2019m actually wearing leopard print today. [Editor\u2019s note: When Twain sat for this interview, she had on a blue and black leopard print Diane von Furstenberg .] I love the fact that it\u2019s not in classic colors. You can have so much fun with leopard print. It belongs everywhere, from haute couture to a girl out riding a horse with her leopard-print cowboy hat.\n\nAt my shows, I get girls wearing leopard-print cowboy hats with leopard-print fringe jackets. It\u2019s so adaptable, and there are a lot of cool girls out there wearing it as part of their own personal fashion\u2014especially with denim. Denim looks great with leopard print. It\u2019s kind of rock-and-roll-cowgirl-chick. Cowgirl style today is quite sexy and playful. I like to go to rodeos and see how the girls are wearing fitted jeans so beautifully. Rodeo jeans have stretch in them now, so you can wear fitted clothing that still moves and stretches. Cowgirl fashion has come a long way in still allowing you to feel sexy and get your job done.\n\nI\u2019m a big horse rider. When I ride, I\u2019m usually wearing leggings or riding pants, with this pink embroidered shirt that I love. I can\u2019t believe there are no stains on it. There should be all kinds of horse stains on it, but it just never quits. The embroidery reminds me of something that Orville Peck might wear. It\u2019s got a funky Western vibe.\n\nIf I really want to get into a Western spirit, I\u2019ll also wear cowgirl boots. The best cowgirl boots are the ones that are comfortable right off the bat\u2014ones you don\u2019t have to wear in to be comfortable. You\u2019ve got to be able to run in them right off the bat. That\u2019s just my personal feeling about a great cowgirl boot.\n\nI don\u2019t usually ride in cowgirl hats, but I do wear them when I go out. Cowgirl hats give you height\u2014plus they are great for bad hair days. I have a lot of bad hair days. Hats are the perfect finishing touch after you get off a horse and need to do a quick change for going out to dinner. I don\u2019t want to have to fuss with my hair, so I just stick it back in a bun or a ponytail. I put on a great cowgirl hat and, poof, I look dressed up. I love a Stetson. They\u2019re very flattering, really good quality hats. I wouldn\u2019t ride in one, because they\u2019re too pretty. And trust me, when I\u2019m riding, I\u2019m getting dirty. So I don\u2019t want to get a Stetson dirty.\n\n\n\nMy fashion motto is: Wear what is comfortable so that you wear it with confidence. I also really love recycling fashion from my past wardrobe, or going to shops that have vintage things. I\u2019m not a slave to new fashion in that way. People are always giving me advice on fashion. I don\u2019t always get it right. Except for leopard print\u2014that I do get right.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.", "label": "human"}

A stronger-than-expected December jobs report continued to suggest a robust labor market, even as lighter-than-expected wage growth fanned some investor hopes that inflation may be coming down. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 223,000 in December, more than the Dow Jones estimate of 200,000. Meanwhile, average hourly earnings rose 0.3% for the month and gained 4.6% from a year ago. These are compared to estimates of 0.4% and 5% increases. \"The labor market clearly remains strong,\" said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. \"We are now seeing that the household survey and the payroll survey are showing similar signs of strength, and wage growth is looks to be coming down.\"", "label": "human"}

For 2023, my New Year\u2019s resolution is learning more languages and meeting new people.\u201d\n\nArmani Beauty\n\nAnd while the jet-setting starlet is a regular on the red carpet and helped popularize the ostentatious, blinged-out, pigmented makeup looks we saw on Euphoria, don\u2019t let the bright lights and flawless full-face makeup applications fool you. \u201cI\u2019m such a minimalist,\u201d Sweeney admits. In fact, she hopes makeup trends steer in this direction for 2023, urging people to \u201clean more towards that and just embrace all of our own inner beauty.\u201d Because when the camera is not on, that is precisely how Sweeney approaches her makeup: \u201cI\u2019ll use a little bit of Armani Luminous Silk Foundation underneath my eyes and on any little blemishes that I have.

It was so dead\u2026it was horrible.\u201d Of course, Sweeney has been blonde for her biggest roles thus far (Cassie on Euphoria, Olivia in The White Lotus). She switched to red for her most recent project, National Anthem, before reverting back to her signature look. \u201cI was terrified that if I colored it again, I\u2019d be bald,\u201d she says.

{"text": "London CNN \u2014\n\nIn May 2017, Sophie Bichener did what many in their twenties are unable to do: buy a home. She paid around \u00a3230,000 (around $295,000 at the time) for her two-bedroom apartment in a high-rise building in a town north of London, where a train could get her to work in the capital in less than half an hour. She had her foot on the first rung of Britain\u2019s housing ladder, an increasingly difficult feat, and it felt like the only way was up.\n\nA month later, Bichener woke up to news that would change her life. A fire had broken out at a similar block to hers: the 24-story Grenfell Tower in west London, which was encased in flammable cladding. The material meant to keep out the wind and rain went up like a matchstick. The fire killed 72 people and left an entire community homeless and heartbroken. The ordeal sent Bichener into a panic. Was her building also at risk, she wondered?\n\nThe burned remains of Grenfell stood uncovered for months, looming over one of London\u2019s richest boroughs. It became a monument that to many symbolized the disastrous effects of austerity \u2013 the decade-long policy of cost-cutting embarked on by the Conservatives in response to the financial crisis of 2008. The tragedy was made all the more stark by its surroundings: the public housing block is just a five-minute walk from Kensington properties worth tens of millions of pounds. Look one way: scarcely imaginable wealth. The other: a hulking symbol of a broken and divided Britain.\n\nThe deadly blaze that engulfed the Grenfell Tower apartment building on June 14, 2017, was fueled by a type of cladding which is now banned. Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nIn the wake of the fire, there was a wave of promises from politicians that things would change \u2013 that building safety would be improved, social housing reformed, and that responsibility would be taken for the government agenda of public spending cuts, deregulation and privatization that acted as kindling for the tragedy that unfolded.\n\nBut in the five years since, Britons living in tower blocks with unsafe cladding have found themselves stuck in a perpetual state of limbo. CNN spoke with 10 people, who all say they are paralyzed by fear that their buildings could catch fire at any moment, and crippled by costs thrust upon them to fix safety defects that were not their fault \u2013 despite the government promising they would not have to \u201cpay a penny.\u201d\n\nNow, their problems are compounded by a fresh disaster: a spiraling cost-of-living crisis. As energy prices and inflation soar, residents like Bichener are facing an impossible situation, burdened not only by sky-high bills but also the eye-watering expense of remediating properties that now feel more like prisons than homes.\n\nResidents told CNN they were living in a perpetual state of anxiety, inundated by text alerts informing them of mounting bills and waiting on tenterhooks for the next buzz of their phone. Some said their building insurance had quadrupled since they moved in, while others were burdened by ballooning service charges \u2013 hundreds of pounds a month for safety fixes that hadn\u2019t been started.\n\nMany said they had left their mortgages on variable rates in the hopes they could eventually sell their apartments, but after the Bank of England hiked interest rates this fall their repayments had become untenable, with monthly payments almost doubling in some cases. Paired with the rising costs of living \u2013 more expensive energy, fuel and food \u2013 the residents CNN spoke with said they are finding themselves several thousand pounds a year poorer.\n\nWhen Bichener bought her flat in Vista Tower in Stevenage, a 16-story office block built in 1965 and converted into residential housing in 2016, there was \u201cno mention\u201d of fire hazards, she said. \u201cWhen Grenfell happened we spoke to our local council just to double-check all the buildings in the town. We asked the management agent and freeholder [the owner of the apartment building and land] if they have any concerns. At that point, everyone was saying no, all these buildings are good,\u201d Bichener told CNN.\n\nVista Tower, right, in Stevenage. Britons living in unsafe buildings remain haunted by the memory of Grenfell. Sophie Bichener\n\nBut there were soon signs of trouble. The developer that built the block put itself into liquidation \u2013 the first \u201cred flag,\u201d Bichener said. Emails to the freeholder went unanswered \u2013 the second. Then confirmation: In 2019, two years after Grenfell, the management agent reported that the building was unsafe. An inspection had found an array of hazards not previously listed.\n\nAfter the revelations, a group of former Grenfell residents came to visit Vista Tower to raise awareness about the nationwide cladding crisis. Bichener said that one man who had lost a family member in the Grenfell fire told her he was struck by the similarities: \u201cHe said he went cold.\u201d\n\nIn November 2020, she was hit with a life-changing bill from the freeholder. \u201cThe whole project, all of the remediation, came to about \u00a315 million.\u201d Split between the leaseholders, it worked out to be about \u00a3208,000 per flat.\n\nThat bill \u2013 almost the same price she initially paid for the flat \u2013 has hung over Bichener\u2019s head since. The government has offered little help and the political chaos in Britain has made matters worse. There have been seven housing secretaries in the five years since Grenfell, as the governing Conservative Party remains embroiled in internal strife. Some have begun to make progress \u2013 including threatening legal action to get the company that owns Vista Tower to pay up rather than passing the cost on to the residents \u2013 only to find themselves out of the job weeks later.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t afford to live in this building anymore. I don\u2019t want to pay the service charge, I don\u2019t want to pay all of the horrific leaseholder costs. I just don\u2019t want it. But I can\u2019t get out.\u201d Sophie Bichener\n\nMeanwhile, Bichener is still waiting for her life to get back on track. She is unable to sell, because banks are unwilling to lend against the property, and, in recent months, her mortgage, insurance and service charge have all shot up. The crippling costs meant she delayed getting married and has put off having children.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t afford to live in this building anymore. I don\u2019t want to pay the service charge, I don\u2019t want to pay all of the horrific leaseholder costs. I just don\u2019t want it. But I can\u2019t get out,\u201d Bichener, now 30 years old, said. \u201cI\u2019m trapped.\u201d\n\nAnd she\u2019s not alone. Hundreds of thousands of people are believed to be in the same boat, but the UK government has failed to commission a full audit, which means the scale of the impact is unclear. Peter Apps, deputy editor at Inside Housing, who has covered the story meticulously over the past five years, estimates there are likely more than 600,000 people in affected tall buildings and millions more in medium-rise towers \u2013 those between five and 10 stories. CNN has been unable to verify the precise number.\n\nThe fallout from Grenfell\n\nThe problems playing out now are the result of decades of poor policy choices, according to Apps. His new book detailing the Grenfell tragedy and subsequent inquiry, \u201cShow Me the Bodies,\u201d claims the UK \u201clet Grenfell happen\u201d through a combination of \u201cderegulation, corporate greed and institutional indifference.\u201d\n\nEvidence presented to the Grenfell Tower Inquiry found that the local council, which managed the building, had made a \u00a3300,000 ($389,400) saving by switching higher quality zinc cladding to a cheaper aluminum composite material (ACM). This meant for an additional \u00a32,300 ($3,000) per flat, the fire might have been prevented.\n\nAny regulations demanding developers use better quality materials were seen as being \u201canti-business,\u201d Apps told CNN. Developers did not even have to use qualified fire safety inspectors to carry out checks on their buildings \u2013 just individuals the developers themselves deemed to be \u201ccompetent.\u201d\n\nFive years on, the Grenfell victims' families are still waiting for answers -- and thousands are waiting for their buildings to be made safe. TOLGA AKMEN/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSo extensive was the deregulation that the problems were not confined just to high-rise tower blocks \u2013 or even to cladding. Instead, many low-rise buildings suffer from problems ranging from poor fire cavities to flammable insulation.\n\n\u201cThe cladding wasn\u2019t the issue at all,\u201d said Jennifer Frame, a 44-year-old travel industry analyst, who lived in Richmond House in south-west London. \u201cIt was the fact that it was a timber frame building, with a cavity between that and the cladding,\u201d she added, a safety defect that was confirmed by an inspection report.\n\nOne night in September 2019, a fire broke out in a flat in Richmond House. Rather than being contained in one room, the cavity acted \u201clike a chimney,\u201d Frame said. An independent report commissioned by the building owner, Metropolitan Thames Valley Housing Association, and included in written evidence submitted to the UK parliament by residents, revealed that the cavity barriers were either \u201cdefective\u201d or \u201centirely missing\u201d at Richmond House, allowing the fire to spread \u201calmost unhindered\u201d through the 23-flat block.\n\n\u201cThe use of materials such as ACM within cladding systems has rightly attracted a lot of attention since Grenfell. It is now clear that there is a much wider failure by construction companies,\u201d the residents said in their submission.\n\nCladding is meant to keep buildings dry and warm, but lax regulations have resulted in flammable materials being used in many cases. PAUL ELLIS/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSixty residents lost their homes that night. Three years later, Frame is still living in temporary accommodation in the same borough of London, while paying the mortgage for her property which no longer exists. Perversely, she said she feels lucky that it\u2019s only the mortgage \u2013 and not the monumental cost of remediations \u2013 that she\u2019s on the hook for.\n\n\u201cI do consider myself \u2013 for lack of a better word \u2013 one of the lucky ones, as we don\u2019t have the threat of bankruptcy hanging over our head any more,\u201d she said.\n\nCNN reached out for comment to the developer of Richmond House, Berkeley Group, but did not receive a reply. Berkeley Group has previously denied liability.\n\nCladding and cost-of-living crises collide\n\nYears of delay and disputes over who should cover the cost, combined with the sheer stress of living in unsafe buildings, have weighed heavily on residents.\n\nBichener moved back to her parents\u2019 house in 2020. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t face being there,\u201d she said. \u201cI ended up on anti-anxiety and anti-depression medication just from being in those four walls in a pandemic, in a dangerous home, with a life-changing sum of money that would potentially bankrupt me over my head.\u201d\n\nAt a rally for the End Our Cladding Scandal campaign, she recalled being with a group of people her age and how they all broke down in tears. \u201cThey\u2019re the only people who understand the situation you\u2019re in. Everyone\u2019s having huge crises over this.\u201d\n\nTheir options are limited. Most can\u2019t sell their properties, since banks won\u2019t offer mortgages against them. Even if banks were to reverse this policy, it is unclear whether there would be a demand for them, given the spiraling costs of borrowing. According to the residents CNN spoke with, a scant few have been able to sell to cash buyers \u2013 but often at a 60-80% loss.\n\nSome have become \u201cresentful landlords,\u201d a term used by residents who are unable to sell their properties, but are so desperate to move out that they rent it out cheaply to others. Lilli Houghton, 30, rents out her flat in Leeds, a city in the north of England, at a loss to a new tenant. She still pays the service charge for her flat, while also renting a new place elsewhere.\n\nMost have no choice but to wait \u2013 but five years has felt like an eternity. When Zoe Bartley, a 29-year-old lawyer, bought her one-bedroom apartment in Chelmsford, a city in Essex, she thought she\u2019d sell it within a few years to move into a family home.\n\nBut she hasn\u2019t been able to sell. She found a buyer in January 2020 \u2013 but their mortgage was declined after an inspection of the building found a number of fire safety defects.\n\nBartley\u2019s 15-month-old son still sleeps in her bedroom. When her two stepchildren come to stay, \u201cthey have to sleep in the living room,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen they were four and five and I\u2019d just started dating their dad,\u201d they were excited to have sleepovers in the living room. Now they\u2019re nine and 10, \u201cit\u2019s just pathetic,\u201d Bartley said.\n\nBartley said she struggles to sleep knowing that a fire could break out at night. Others who spoke to CNN say they have trained their children on what to do when the alarms go off.\n\nA waiting game\n\nEarlier this year, residents in unsafe buildings began to see some fledgling signs of progress. In a letter to developers, the then-housing secretary, Michael Gove, said it was \u201cneither fair nor decent that innocent leaseholders \u2026 should be landed with bills they cannot afford to fix problems they did not cause.\u201d He set out a plan to work with the industry to find a solution.\n\nFirst, he gave developers two months \u201cto agree to a plan of action to fund remediation costs,\u201d estimated at \u00a34 billion (around $5.4 billion). That deadline passed with no agreement reached.\n\nTo force developers\u2019 hands, the Building Safety Act was passed into law in April, which requires the fire safety defects in all buildings above 11 meters to be fixed and created a fund to help cover the costs. The act implemented a \u201cwaterfall\u201d system: Developers would be expected to pay first, but, if they are unable to, then the cost would fall to the building owners. If they are also unable to pay, only then would the cost fall to the leaseholders. Leaseholders\u2019 costs were capped at \u00a310,000 ($11,400), or \u00a315,000 ($17,000) in London, for those who met certain criteria. The government asked 53 companies to sign this pledge; many did.\n\nFor many residents, this came as a relief. They had faced life-changing bills for years, but the cap meant they wouldn\u2019t be totally wiped out. It seemed the worst of their worries were over.\n\nBut there was a problem: The pledge made by developers wasn\u2019t legally binding. Even though the government has made money available for remediation, no mechanism has yet forced any developers to make use of it.\n\nBichener still doesn't know when remediation work on Vista Tower will begin, how long it will take, or who will pay for it. Alamy\n\nOne resident explained to CNN: \u201cPrior to Michael Gove, your building owner could give you a bill to replace the cladding. They\u2019re now not able to do that anymore, but that doesn\u2019t mean your building gets fixed.\u201d\n\nThe government tried again. In July it published contracts to turn the \u201cpledge into legally binding undertakings.\u201d If developers signed the contract, this would commit them to remediating their buildings. Still, there was nothing obliging the developers to sign these contracts \u2013 and so none did.\n\nIn October, Vista Tower \u2013 where Bichener lives \u2013 came under scrutiny. Then-Housing Secretary Simon Clarke set a 21-day deadline for Grey GR, the owner of the building, to commit to fixing it. \u201cThe lives of over 100 people living in Vista Tower have been put on hold,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cEnough is enough.\u201d Bichener stressed her building was just one among thousands in need of remediation, but welcomed this as a \u201cstep in the right direction.\u201d\n\nBut when that deadline came, Clarke was already out of the job. He had been appointed by former UK Prime Minister Liz Truss, but after her six-week premiership came to an end, Clarke was replaced in the subsequent reshuffle. The deadline passed without Grey GR making any commitment.\n\nGove was reappointed by new Prime Minister Rishi Sunak as Clarke\u2019s successor in October. In response to questions from CNN, the UK\u2019s Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) confirmed that the government has started formal proceedings against Grey GR.\n\n\u201cWe are finalizing the legally binding contracts that developers will sign to fix their unsafe buildings, and expect them to do so very soon,\u201d a DLUHC spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n\u201cI think the \u2018who\u2019s paying\u2019 question will drag on for many years. That might be through court cases and tribunals. But I don\u2019t see how it will be resolved.\u201d Sophie Bichener\n\nGrey GR told CNN that it was \u201cabsolutely committed to carrying out the remediation works required,\u201d but that they had not started yet due to obstacles in receiving government funds.\n\n\u201cIssues with gaining access to [the Building Safety Fund], created by Government, have been, and remain, the fundamental roadblock to progress,\u201d Grey GR said in a statement, adding that the security of residents was of the \u201cutmost priority\u201d and that it was taking steps to make buildings safer.\n\nBut, according to Bichener, residents are no safer than they were five years ago. All that has changed is that, legally, they will no longer have to pay tens or hundreds of thousands of pounds to fix their buildings.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped building owners from seeking funds from residents though. \u201cThe amount of \u00a3208,430.04 is outstanding in connection with [your] property,\u201d read a letter sent to a resident of Vista Tower by the building owner in November. \u201cWe would appreciate your remittance within the next seven days.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, life for the residents of these buildings goes on. Since speaking to CNN, Bichener got married. She and her husband are both paying off their own mortgages until she is able to sell her flat. For years they had been \u201cstressed,\u201d she said, asking \u201cdo we tie ourselves together and have these two properties?\u201d But they decided they couldn\u2019t put their lives on pause forever because of her Vista Tower nightmare.\n\n\u201cI want to have left,\u201d Bichener said of where she wants to be, a year from now. \u201cThe dream is that I no longer own that property and I am long gone and I never have to see it or visit it again.\n\n\u201cBut if I\u2019m realistic, I think we\u2019ll be in the same situation.

MMI, one of Dubai\u2019s biggest alcohol retailers and a subsidiary of the state-owned Emirates group, has 21 stores across the city, according to its website.\n\nAfrican + Eastern, another drinks retailer, said on its Instagram page on Sunday that it had removed the tax and that it was now offering personal liquor licenses at zero cost.\n\nMuslims are prohibited from acquiring licenses for purchase of alcohol in Dubai.\n\nCNN has contacted the Dubai government media office for comment.\n\nThe changes will be in place for one year as part of a trial period, Reuters reported, citing domestic media sources.\n\nFacing emerging competition from countries in the region, several UAE cities have shifted toward globally attractive policies over the past years, including the legalization of cohabitation by unmarried couples, and allowing the sale of alcohol during the holy month of Ramadan, which was previously banned across the country.\n\nMost recently, a Monday to Friday work week was introduced to synchronize with global business, after years of a Sunday to Thursday schedule.\n\nThe sale of alcohol in the UAE is already more liberalized compared to neighboring Gulf countries. Almost 90% of its population is made up of foreigners.\n\nInternational visitors spent more than $29 billion in Dubai in 2022, the most of anywhere in the world, according to data from the World Travel and Tourism Council.\n\nBut the city faces increasing competition from its neighbor, Saudi Arabia, which is investing heavily in its own tourism sector as it diversifies its economy away from oil.\n\nCrown Prince Mohamed bin Salman is trying to rebrand the kingdom\u2019s image away from a conservative Muslim country to attract global businesses, talent and tourism.

{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nHouse GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy still does not have enough vote commitments to be the next speaker following a nearly hour-long call with various factions of the Republican conference, and even as he has made a number of significant concessions in recent days.\n\nMcCarthy is racing the clock to try to lock down votes ahead of the House vote to elect a new speaker on Tuesday.\n\nThe call, which was described by multiple sources as collegial, focused on some of the same sticking points that have languished for weeks within GOP ranks. Republicans committed to continue working throughout the weekend to find a resolution, with lawmakers acknowledging there are still major issues to work through.\n\n\u201cRules are still in discussion. No concrete package to show at moment,\u201d one GOP lawmaker told CNN. \u201cBut if support is there, we may have some agreements.\u201d\n\nHouse Republicans have been debating whether to reinstate an arcane rule that would empower any member to bring up a vote to oust a sitting speaker at any time. For McCarthy\u2019s backers, the so-called motion to vacate the speaker\u2019s chair is seen as something that could be used by the right flank to hamstring his ability to lead the conference and effectively govern.\n\nIn one separate breakthrough, however, McCarthy did say he was open to moving forward with a committee that would investigate federal government activity and look into political partisanship at agencies, such as the FBI and the Justice Department.\n\nWhat form that committee takes is still unclear, but it has been a top ask from conservatives such as Rep. Chip Roy of Texas. This would centralize the myriad probes into the Biden administration into a single panel, but the idea could run into resistance from the soon-to-be committee chairs, who have already begun work on the House GOP\u2019s planned investigations.\n\nAnother concern is over whether the various concessions will even deliver enough votes to make McCarthy the speaker. In a positive sign for McCarthy, another GOP lawmaker did say that some Republicans, who previously considered themselves on the fence, announced on Friday\u2019s call that they are now leaning toward McCarthy based on the ongoing negotiations.\n\nOne previously undecided lawmaker, Rep. Morgan Griffith of Virginia, announced in a statement Friday evening that he would support McCarthy.\n\nGriffith, a senior member of the hardline House Freedom Caucus who was on the Friday call, said McCarthy has agreed to \u201ca rule that legislation will only have a single purpose\u201d as well as another change that would require \u201ca stricter germaneness rule.\u201d\n\n\u201cA single bill should not be a hodgepodge of issues totaling thousands of pages,\u201d Griffith said in the statement. \u201cI believe these changes can dramatically improve our legislative process. Because Leader McCarthy agreed to these rules changes, I have agreed to vote for him for Speaker of the House.\u201d\n\nOn the motion to vacate, McCarthy has expressed an openness to lowering the threshold down to five members, which is something members of the Freedom Caucus are pushing for. But one source told CNN that there was \u201cdeep hesitancy\u201d from other members who fear that lowering the threshold could hold the conference hostage in the months to come.\n\nThe source told CNN there was \u201ca lot of frustration over opening this back up.\u201d\n\nSome House Republicans have pressed for a process that would allow any single member to hold a floor vote on ousting the sitting speaker, which was wielded over former Speaker John Boehner before he was forced out of the job by the far right in 2015.\n\nMcCarthy has been adamantly opposed to restoring the \u201cmotion to vacate the chair,\u201d and a majority of the House GOP voted against the idea during a closed-door meeting in November.", "label": "human"}
{"text": ".. Over the past few years, Twitter's employees have generated unexpected expectations about office facilities. But in recent weeks, the Silicon Valley giant has taken cost cuts to a new level, putting its employees in a catastrophic crisis. The issue first emerged in early December, when multiple Twitter employees came to the company's internal Slack message board and posted messages asking for toilet paper. They wrote that basic office supplies were running out of use and that the remaining volumes needed to be rationed. The posts caused panic among employees, who feared the lack of toilet paper was due to Twitter's savings. But the company said the shortage was due to a deliberate decision to reduce the number of staff managing office facilities. \"We have decided to reduce the size of our facilities team in order to simplify certain business areas and manage costs,\" Twitter said in a statement. \"We have been actively supporting this team throughout the transition period. We understand the need for basic office supplies, and we are working aggressively to ensure that our offices have the equipment needed to serve employees.\" Unfortunately, for employees, cost-cutting measures seem to have unexpected consequences: an unpleasant odor seems to come from the bathroom. \"I smelled something terrible in the bathroom,\" one employee wrote on a Slack board, \"for days. The root cause of odor has been proven to be the accumulation of waste in pipeline systems due to inadequate cleaning and maintenance, a problem that has been addressed by the lack of adequate staff to manage facilities. \"It's really nasty and doesn't show a focus on employee well-being,\" one employee told Business Insider. The decision to cut office workers appears to have been made by Twitter's CEO Elon Musk, who has a reputation for reducing costs to increase profits, and who seems to be applying this approach to the company's facilities. The decision sparked outrage from Twitter employees, who asked the company to address issues ranging from a lack of toilet paper to the smell of bathrooms. \"Twitter is proud to be an inclusive and progressive workplace,\" one employee wrote on Slack's board of directors. \"This is a basic human need. How do we get what we need while maintaining our budget?\" But as employees increasingly express their need for basic office supplies and cleaner workplaces, it's clear that Twitter needs to do more to meet their needs. Until then, employees will continue to be in a notorious situation.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Here are the top 5 financial resolutions you should make this year\n\nIf you\u2019re planning to make financial resolutions this year, you\u2019re not alone.\n\nA survey from Ascent shows that most Americans (two-thirds) plan on making a money resolution for 2023.\n\nWith rising interest rates, still-high inflation, worries about layoffs and the broader economic landscape in general, it makes sense that resolutions focused on money are foremost in the minds of so many Americans.\n\nHere are some of the more popular \u2014 and timely \u2014 ones to make.\n\nA woman takes a look at the giant, seven-foot-tall numerals for \"2023\", as it arrives for the December 31 Times New Year's Eve celebrations, at Times Square in New York City, U.S., December 20, 2022. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz\n\nPay down credit card debt\n\nPaying down credit card debt is always a top resolution, but this year it should be a priority since the average rate on a credit card is almost 20%. That\u2019s up from just 16.3% at the beginning of 2022, and is the highest it\u2019s been since Bankrate started tracking credit card rates in 1985.\n\n\u201cFor someone making only minimum payments toward $5000 in credit card debt, the rate hikes have added seven months to the payback cycle, costing an additional $1,166 in interest,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate.com and Creditcards.com .\n\nGiven that the Fed has indicated that more interest rate hikes are on the way, this debt is only going to get costlier in 2023.\n\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.\n\nBolster emergency savings\n\nAn emergency fund is your first line of defense against financial hardship. Without it, you\u2019re putting yourself at risk of financial catastrophe, yet just 27% of Americans have the recommended six months\u2019 worth of expenses saved up, said Rossman.\n\nDon\u2019t become a statistic \u2014 especially now, since we could be heading into a recession in 2023.\n\n\u201cWhile most projections are for a relatively mild recession (unlike the double-digit unemployment rates we saw in 2009 and 2020), there\u2019s only one way for the unemployment rate to go from here: up. Even a rise to 5% unemployment would represent about two million additional people out of work,\u201d Rossman said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that to scare people, but rather to emphasize the importance of saving for that proverbial rainy day.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt might not even be a job loss,\u201d he added. \u201cIt might be a broken refrigerator, a leaky roof, a surprise medical bill, or some other unexpected event, and you need to be prepared.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nReadjust or revise your budget\n\nThis is a good idea every year, but it\u2019s especially important following a year of high inflation, said Richard Barrington, a financial analyst at Credit Sesame .\n\n\u201cUpdate your budget to make sure you are spending less than you are bringing home. Otherwise, you\u2019ll be building debt,\" Barrington said. \"That just adds interest expenses on top of higher prices.\u201d\n\nBoost your retirement savings\n\n(Photo: Getty Creative)\n\nWhen it comes to saving for retirement, you may be feeling discouraged given what happened last year.\n\n\u201cRetirement savings were hit by a double blow in 2022,\u201d Barrington said. \u201cA very bad year for stocks and bonds sank the value of most retirement investments. Meanwhile, unusually high inflation means you\u2019ll need more money to live on by the time you retire.\u201d\n\nKeep your emotions in check and continue contributing to your retirement account \u2014 at least enough to qualify for your employer's full match. Those matches typically involve contributing 3% to 5% of your salary.\n\nIf you can\u2019t afford to contribute that much right now, take a slow and steady approach with gradual increases that, over time, can make a big difference.\n\n\u201cMake a note to try to up your contribution by a percentage point or two in six months,\" Rossman said. \u201cEvery dollar you set aside for retirement in your 20s and 30s could be worth $15 or even $20 by the time you retire.\u201d\n\nImprove your credit\n\nThe kind of environment we\u2019re heading into in 2023 \u2014 higher interest rates and a slower economy \u2014 makes it especially important to have a strong credit score, said Barrington.\n\n\u201cWith interest rates rising, you\u2019ll want a good enough credit score to qualify for the lowest rates available,\u201d Barrington said.\n\nAlso, in a slow economy defaults on credit payments tend to rise, added Barrington. \u201cThis may make banks tighten their credit standards. If you want to continue to have credit available, it\u2019s a good idea to make sure your credit score is in tip-top shape in 2023.\u201d\n\nPersonal finance journalist Vera Gibbons is a former staff writer for SmartMoney magazine and a former correspondent for Kiplinger's Personal Finance.

He had said before his 2016 reelection that he would not seek a fourth term if he won that year.\n\nThe stock sales occurred, a week before equities markets in the U.S. and elsewhere plunged as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic , and after Burr had received briefings about the threat of the pandemic. Burr and Fauth had a very short phone call on the same day as the stock sales, the SEC has said in court filings.\n\nThe SEC, which did not deny the attorneys' statements, was eying Burr, a Republican, and his brother-in-law Gerald Fauth , who sits on a federal board , in a civil probe for their stock sales on the same day in February 2020.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has ended its insider trading investigation of former U.S. Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina and his brother-in-law without taking action against either man, their lawyers said Friday.\n\nThe Department of Justice earlier had closed a criminal investigation of Burr and Fauth without taking action against either man.\n\nAs part of that criminal probe, Burr had his cellphone seized by the FBI in May 2020, which led to him stepping aside as chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\nBurr, in a statement provided to CNBC on Friday, said, \"This week, the SEC informed me that they have concluded their investigation with no action.\"\n\n\"I am glad to have this matter in the rearview mirror as I begin my retirement from the Senate following nearly three decades of public service,\" Burr said.\n\nIn her own statement, his attorney Alice Fisher said, \"We have believed all along that this is the right result.\"\n\nBurr \"is glad to put this matter behind him as he embarks on his retirement from his dedicated service in the Senate,\" Fisher said.\n\nIn a statement, Fauth's lawyer, F. Joseph Warin, said, \"The SEC has closed its investigation into our client. \"\n\n\"We are thrilled that the SEC and the DOJ appropriately closed their investigations without any findings of insider trading,\" Warin said. \"Mr. Fauth looks forward to continuing his public service and leadership in the transportation industry.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the SEC, in an email to CNBC, said, \"As a matter of policy, the SEC does not comment on the opening or closing of a possible investigation.\"\n\nBurr, like other senators, had been briefed by federal health officials in early 2020 about the coronavirus before it began spreading widely in the U.S., leading to nationwide lockdowns and decreases in business activities.\n\nAt the time, Burr, due to his membership on the intelligence committee, had access to classified intelligence reports that contained dire warnings about the pandemic.\n\nFauth, who is the brother of Burr's wife, is a member and former chairman of the National Mediation Board, an agency that facilitates labor-management relations in the U.S. railroad and airline industries.\n\nThe SEC in court filings has said that on Feb. 13, 2020, Burr called his stockbroker and directed him to sell more than $1.65 million worth of stock. The holdings accounted for \"all but one of the equities in his and his wife's joint individual retirement account ... portfolio.\"\n\nAlmost three hours later, Burr called Fauth's cellphone for a call that lasted 50 seconds, the SEC has said.\n\nA minute or less after that, Fauth called his primary stockbroker, who did not answer, the SEC has said in a filing. Fauth then called a second broker within two minutes and \"directed her to sell several stocks in his wife's account,\" the filing reveals.\n\nThat broker sold between $97,000 and $280,000 worth of Fauth's shares in six companies, several of which ended up having their stocks plummet in the following weeks, the filing indicates.\n\nAfter Burr's stock sales came to light in March 2020, he said, \"I relied solely on public news reports to guide my decision regarding the sale of stocks.\"\n\n\"Specifically, I closely followed CNBC's daily health and science reporting out of its Asia bureaus at the time,\" Burr said at that time.", "label": "human"}

We will explore various approaches taken by countries such as the United States, China, Japan, and the European Union, and assess the impact of these measures on their economies. We will look at how public discourse around the pandemic has evolved in 2021, and its impact on policy formation and implementation. We will also look at the role of technology in fighting the virus and its potential long-term effects. In addition, we will explore the growing significance of shared property - a variety of public spaces, networks and services shared by an entire global community. We will examine how it can be used to create a more equitable society, and how it can bring people from all walks of life together to work together to solve common challenges. In the wake of the pandemic, the world has seen an unprecedented level of environmental awareness and activism, a question that will go deep into these efforts. We will highlight how grassroots movements have played a role in creating public pressure for policy change, and how the impact of the commons has opened up debate to engage various voices. Finally, this issue will explore the potential of future global connectivity and collaboration. We'll look at how AI, robotics, and distributed ledger technologies can create opportunities for individuals and communities around the world. We hope that the January/February 2023 edition of The Atlantic will provide an opportunity to reflect on the tremendous progress made in 2021 and remind people of the importance of embracing commons during times of crisis. Looking ahead to a uncertain future, we hope that the lessons learned from 2021 will help us build a more equitable and connected world.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Is it his own private island? Sergey Brin may be the 13th richest person in the world, but that hasn't stopped him from living a surprisingly busy social life. Over the past few years, the Google co-founder - estimated to be worth $61.6 billion - has been spotted at some of the world's funniest events and most unique destinations. From the Las Vegas party at Hilton Paris to the burning human festival in northern New York, Brin is spending his best billionaire life. Now there are reports that Brin has bought his own private island - a stunning Caribbean resort. We decided to take a closer look at Brin's busy social schedule to understand what he has been doing - and what the future might hold for him. a Global Traveller It's no secret that billionaires love to travel. Since 2017, Brin has been a decoration on the red carpet of some of the world's most spectacular events. In April 2017, he attended the Metropolitan Gala in New York City. A few months later, he flew to Las Vegas for a Hilton party in Paris. He has also participated in some of the most popular celebrity talk shows, such as the \"Dionysian Festival\", an exclusive burning men's style show held in Upper New York. Brin's journey also allowed him to travel across ponds to Europe, and even farther into Asia. Last November, he stopped in the French Riviera for an exclusive party sponsored by Russian oligarch Mikhail Prokhorov. This year, the billionaire made his own private trip to Malaysia, Taiwan and the United Arab Emirates, where he spent a week of leisure time around the world. His Secret Island According to reports, Brin may be planning to buy his own private Caribbean island. The island, located in the British Virgin Islands, is said to cost about $7 million. The region has been a popular destination for other tech elites, such as billionaire investor Peter Thiel, who reportedly bought his own island in the area in 2015. The island is only 5 acres in size and uninhabited, surrounded by stunning beaches with spectacular views of the Caribbean Sea. If Brin does buy the island, he will join many other tech billionaires - including Oracle founder Larry Ellison and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen - who have all bought their own private Caribbean resort. The Last Boundaries Of course, all of these trips are just the taste that Google's co-founders have. In the past, Brin made no secret of his interest in space travel and exploration. He invested heavily in a startup called Planetary Resources, which aims to mine minerals from asteroids. He is also reportedly planning a high-profile outer space trip - becoming the first private individual to travel around the world on his own spacecraft. It's not clear when this trip will happen, but it seems likely sooner rather than later. So be on your guard for the long-distance travel of billionaires. II. Conclusions Sergey Brin is one of the world's most successful entrepreneurs, and his social agenda is equally impressive. He has participated in some of the world's most exotic events and unique destinations - from parties in Las Vegas to Hilton Paris to Burning Man Day in northern New York State. Now, it looks like Brin is going to go even further - there are reports that he's about to buy his own private island in the British Virgin Islands. If all goes according to plan, he will soon be the first person to travel around the world on a spaceship. As Brin's life story continues, we can't wait to see what else he has on his sleeve.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Disney shocked the entire executive leadership team, including its CEO Bob Chapek, when it announced that it had contacted former chief executive Bob Iger to take over the company, people familiar with the matter told CNBC. The surprising move left those close to Chapbeck blind, and some have been asking if it could be the end of Chapek's tenure at Disney. The story took place on Friday night, when Bloomberg reported that Disney had asked Iger to return to the helm and take back control of the company, six months after he resigned as chairman and CEO. Disney later confirmed to CNBC that Iger had been asked to take over as CEO, and Chapek accepted the decision. It is unclear what prompted Disney's sudden decision, or why they decided to contact Igg on Friday. However, people familiar with the matter said that Chapek did not make a prior judgment about this decision and was blind. The move caused a stir among Disney executives and raised questions about Chapbeck's future. It is not clear whether Chapbeck will continue as CEO or take on new roles within the company. Chapbeck led Disney's $71.3 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox in the months leading up to Iger's departure. The deal was later approved by regulators, but consolidation between the two companies is still underway. Iger's return to Disney may have been intended to help the ongoing integration process. But there could be other reasons for this surprising move. Iger took over as Disney's CEO in 2005 and resigned earlier this year. Since then, he has worked with Disney as executive chairman, but his decision to abandon the role of CEO is widely seen as a move to begin handing control of the company to a new generation of leaders. Chapbeck has long been seen as Disney's rising star, and is widely regarded as a powerful leader who can lead the company into the future. But it seems that Disney has decided to look at some of its future leadership from the past. The move to re-emerge Iger as CEO may be welcomed by many of Ager's supporters of leadership and strategic vision. But it could also be seen as a sign of lack of confidence in Disney's current executive team. In any case, the return of Iger as Disney's CEO could have a major impact on the company, something that Chapek and other Disney leadership must accept.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Burned by layoffs, tech workers are rethinking risk 'Not everybody is walking away with a year\u2019s worth of runway in their pocket'\n\nTech isn\u2019t as collegial as it used to be. Rocket ships are being unveiled as sputtering messes, mission-driven startups don\u2019t feel so mission-oriented when responding to investor pressure, and widespread layoffs offer a loud reminder that jobs are breakable contracts, not sacrosanct vows.\n\nOver the past few months, thousands of employees from Meta, Twitter, Stripe, Amazon, DoorDash and countless other companies that don\u2019t have the privilege of being household names are back on the job market. A job market that includes hiring freezes, salary cuts and a general malaise that industry experts warn won\u2019t be over this year.\n\nSo where does tech\u2019s talent go from here?\n\nThe answer is complicated, and it\u2019s too early to have definitive labor data. VCs want to fund the newest tech mafia startups before banks do, top MBA programs want laid off workers to join so badly that they\u2019re waiving standardized test score requirements, and the tech companies that are in a position to hire really want you to know it.\n\nTechCrunch spoke to laid-off employees about how they\u2019re approaching their careers differently in 2023. Pseudonyms have been used in cases where names are included to protect current and future employment prospects, per the requests of the individuals quoted. The common thread between all the answers includes a reframing of how \u201csafe\u201d it is to work in tech, and, perhaps more importantly, what it takes to jump back into the sector after getting burned.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m taking my control back\u2019\n\nAaliyah was laid off from her tech job in the spring. Just one month earlier, she had a positive review with her boss and was promised a raise with more stock options.\n\nThe layoff thus came as a surprise. And unlike some of her colleagues, who put their names in spreadsheets and jumped back into the job hunt, Aaliyah took a few weeks to think. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to stay in tech, I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to work for anyone,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI had to make a decision in terms of what I want my day-to-day life to look like financially; am I going to hustle or do I just want to take what falls into my lap?\u201d she said on the phone. \u201cAfter a couple of weeks, I felt like I\u2019m ready to take more control back as opposed to just letting people kind of sway me one way or another.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Aaliyah works two full-time tech jobs \u2013 neither company knows \u2013 and she runs a consultancy business on the side. While many people work multiple jobs to make ends meet, the opportunity to work multiple full-time jobs in tech has been amplified by remote work and layoffs. In fact, over 39,000 people are in the \u201cOveremployed\u201d Discord community, which is self-described \u201cas a community of professionals looking to work two remote jobs, earn extra income, and achieve financial freedom. Be free from office politics and layoffs.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever again am I going to put myself into a position where I\u2019m dependent on one stream of income from one company that may or may not do what\u2019s in my interest,\u201d Aaliyah said. \u201cThey\u2019re gonna do what they want, and I\u2019m going to do what\u2019s mine.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also a hedge against the bias she says she faces as a Black woman in tech.\n\n\u201cAs a Black woman, sometimes I feel slighted by being overlooked and not feeling like anyone thinks I\u2019m capable of doing more,\u201d she said. \u201cSo you may not have thought that I was capable of doing a lot more but I actually do \u2013 and you don\u2019t know what\u2019s in my bank account.\u201d\n\nSome see over-employment as their next step, while others are still reflecting on how their job title evolves in this new environment.\n\nThe two-time second hire\n\nSam has noticed an odd pattern in his work. He\u2019s been the second finance hire, twice, by two venture-backed startups. And he\u2019s been laid off by both of those companies over the past year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been odd, because I chose accounting and finance as my major back in undergrad 15 years ago because I was told it was the backbone of business, that they needed it in order for a business to function,\u201d Sam said. He turned to mentors in the space, and says that \u201ctheir first reaction is that typically finance isn\u2019t a function that is affected in these layoffs.\u201d While the tech worker says that \u201caccounting is an afterthought in tech,\u201d the reality is a bit more complicated.\n\nWhile it seems that every other chief executive attributes \u201ca need to be more disciplined\u201d as a reason for conducting company-wide layoffs, even a strong financial runway isn\u2019t enough to keep people hired. In Sam\u2019s case, he was first let go by a Series B software-as-a-service product after a funding round fell through, so he began looking for new jobs that promised more financial stability. He eventually began interviewing with a number of companies, and ended up choosing an ed-tech marketplace that had promised they had a large cash position from a recent fundraising spree. Then, when that company laid him off, he realized that good books aren\u2019t enough to justify job stability.\n\nToday, Sam is doing part-time work, which he set up when he began hearing rumors of the second round of layoffs, and interviewing for full-time gigs. There\u2019s a clash between what he wants, which is a stable, reliable job, and what he naturally cares about as someone who has spent time working in scrappy startups on small teams.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a dilemma I have right now, where I\u2019m going through every process with a company that is much healthier on their bottom line, they have 401(K) match\u2026. if an offer ever does come from [those] companies, can I bring myself around enough to be interested? It\u2019s hard to know what you care about.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s still frustrated over losing his job at the edtech company.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re out here building an edtech marketplace. And here I am, with all of the experience and skills and knowledge to help the company do that and I won\u2019t be able to see that through,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like it\u2019s their missed opportunity. That\u2019s what I still like struggle with.\u201d\n\n\u2018Not everybody is walking away with a year\u2019s worth of runway in their pockets\u2019\n\nNot long before Mary was fired from an HR tech company, she was given an award that recognized her contributions to the team. The trophy was still being engraved with her name when she got the call, just weeks later, that her job had been terminated due to the macroeconomic climate.\n\nEven worse, it was the second time this company laid her off. The first time, Mary reflects, was in March 2020 when \u201cthe world was falling apart.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like corporate irresponsibility or anything, it was just like, everything is on fire and we\u2019re so sorry,\u201d she said \u201cThen a few months later, they called me back, saying that things are not as bad as we thought.\u201d Because the job market was tough \u2013 and she didn\u2019t sense any poor management issues \u2013 she rejoined, got a small raise, her equity was reinstated, and so the job continued for the next two years, until she was laid off again this summer.\n\nMary went back on the job hunt again, this time ending up at a venture-backed early-stage startup. Then, a few weeks into the job, she got laid off. This time, it stung even more \u2013 because this was the first job where she earned a six-figure salary since joining the tech world years ago.\n\n\u201cI had just broken six figures and I had that for only five weeks,\u201d Mary said. \u201cI was really excited to max out my 401(k) and now I\u2019m thinking I should have kept that extra two grand in cash.\u201d Right now, she has five weeks of pay, one month of Cobra healthcare insurance, and plans to sign up for Medicaid.\n\n\u201cNot everybody is walking away with a year\u2019s worth of runway in their pocket,\u201dMary said. \u201cWhen people had really high salaries and enjoyed really high salaries for the majority of their career \u2013 they assume other people have personal savings to guard against this[\u2026] but life is really expensive.\u201d\n\nDespite being burned, Mary isn\u2019t leaving the tech world because she\u2019s inspired by \u201cthe incredibly bright, talented, capable people who are just trying to build something.\u201d This year, she plans to ask her network for help with the job hunt, adding that no one is looking at cold job applications while Stripe and Twitter talent is getting laid off.\n\nShe plans to be direct. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of how profitable is enough?\u201d she said, at one point during the interview. \u201cWhen is it enough to sustain your workforce \u2013 what math is happening here?\u201d\n\nBut she also is aware that, ultimately, what happened to her over the past twelve months may happen again.\n\n\u201cYou can ask all the right questions, you can do all the research, you can ask about burn and runway and all these things \u2013 and even if they say all the right things, if something changes in the market, there\u2019s just very little power that you have as an individual,\u201d she said. \u201cOther than to, you know, save as much as you possibly can for a rainy day.\u201d", "label": "human"}
{"text": "A long and controversial campaign season has finally come to an end for Kansas Attorney General Chris Kobach, who was elected. On Tuesday, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) announced a fine of more than $1.2 million on Kobe's 2020 U.S. Senate campaign because it accepted too much campaign contributions and failed to accurately report them. The U.S. Federal Election Commission found that Kobach, who received the most votes in the Kansas Republican primary, accepted nearly $1.4 million more than the legal limit for his primary and general election campaigns. Kobach, who lost to Senator Roger Marshall in November's election, was also accused of failing to accurately disclose allocations and donations from the Political Committee, violating federal campaign funding laws. In a statement released Tuesday, Kobach said he was \"sorry\" about the violations and vowed to \"continue to comply with FEC rules.\" \"I acknowledge that the Federal Election Commission has made a reasonable decision, I regret any mistakes that may have been made in my campaign and will ensure future compliance with the rules of the Federal Election Commission,\" Kobach said. Kobach's campaign was also accused of illegally coordinating with the SuperPAC, which spent millions on his behalf. The FEC dismissed these allegations, but the U.S. Department of Justice is still conducting a separate investigation into potential violations. The FEC also fined two Kobach political advisers for failing to properly report campaign spending and other activities. Kobach, who served as Secretary of State for Kansas from 2011 to 2019, was an early supporter of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and a consultant during his former presidency. Kobach has been an outspoken advocate of tough immigration policies by Trump and played a leading role in the government's voter fraud committee. But his hard-line stance on immigration and voting rights has also drawn criticism from many Republicans. His opponents in the Kansas primary, including businessman Roger Marshall, who eventually won the Republican nomination, have criticized Kobe for not doing enough to get people into the Republican lineup. The fines were a major setback for Kobach's political career, which lasted until 2022. He was the most popular candidate to run for governor of Kansas, and his name has surfaced as a potential candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024. Kobach, who will serve as the state's top law enforcement official on Jan. 8, could face additional penalties in the future, depending on the outcome of a Justice Department investigation. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina was fined $140,000 in December last year for making false statements about the committee, a high-profile politician recently fined by the U.S. Federal Election Commission for campaign funding irregularities.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".. Gregg Berhalter has not given up on his dream of leading the U.S. men's soccer team to the 2022 FIFA World Cup, despite recent unrest surrounding the fight between the U.S. Soccer Federation and the team on the pitch. Burhart was named head coach of the U.S. national team in December 2018, and despite widespread criticism from the team following the 2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup knockout and subsequent failure to qualify for the 2020 Copa America, he remains keen to stay ahead. The 48-year-old coach has seen his contract extended until the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, and he is convinced that he can help the team turn things around in time. \"I'm happy, I'm honored to be part of this opportunity,\" Behart said in a statement released by the U.S. Soccer Federation. \"I believe that I am the right coach to lead this group of players and staff for the next two years and beyond. I appreciate this opportunity, and I look forward to working together to achieve our goals.\" Despite the challenges ahead, Belhardt still believes that if they can achieve some good results in the upcoming FIFA World Cup qualifiers in 2021 and 2022, the team can qualify for the World Cup. \"It's not impossible to qualify for the World Cup, and I believe this team has the potential to do that. I know the players are focused and determined to put the past behind them,\" he said. \"The next two years are critical for the national team and I'm committed to doing everything I can to give us the best chance of success in 2022. Behart's tenure as head of the U.S. national team has been turbulent, with the team failing to impress in the 2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup and the 2020 Copa America, and a series of controversial decisions that plunged the federation into chaos. However, Behart is eager to put the past behind him and focus on the future of USMNT, starting with their next challenge - a friendly match against Trinidad and Tobago on January 19. \"We look forward to our friendship against Trinidad and Tobago, and I believe we can start moving in the right direction,\" he said. With USMNT in an ever-changing state, Berhalt will be eager to prove his value as head coach by helping the team restore past glory ahead of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. It remains to be seen whether Bercht can do that, but one thing is certain - he's determined to keep working and help the team turn things around.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nRep.-elect George Santos made additional false claims over the years about his family history, work history and education in campaign appearances over the years, a review of statements made in two of his campaigns for Congress found.\n\nCNN\u2019s KFile uncovered more falsehoods from Santos, including claims he was forced to leave a New York City private school when his family\u2019s real estate assets took a downturn and stating he represented Goldman Sachs at a top financial conference where he berated the company for investing in renewables.\n\nCNN also reviewed more instances of Santos providing additional false history of his family\u2019s background. In one interview, Santos said his mother\u2019s family\u2019s historical Jewish name was \u201cZabrovsky,\u201d and later appeared to operate a GoFundMe campaign for a pet charity (which he falsely claimed was a 501(c)(3) nonprofit) under that alias. Genealogists CNN previously spoke with found no evidence of Jewish or Ukrainian heritage in his family tree.\n\nIn another, he said his mother, whose family has lived in Brazil since the late 1800s, was a White immigrant from Belgium.\n\nSantos\u2019 campaign did not respond to CNN\u2019s comment request.\n\nSince reports first surfaced about his false claims, Santos has made efforts to downplay his fabrications as mere \u201cembellishments.\u201d But the previously unreported claims from Santos illustrate a pattern of fabricating details about his life, often in service of presenting a more compelling or interesting personal narrative. The Nassau County district attorney\u2019s office said Wednesday that it is looking into Santos\u2019 fabrications, though it did not specify the falsehoods it would explore.\n\nIn interviews over the past few days, Santos admitted to lying about parts of his resume, including graduating from college, but he told the New York Post that the misrepresentation of his work history at Goldman Sachs and Citigroup was a \u201cpoor choice of words.\u201d There is no record he worked at the top financial institutions in the country, as he had previously claimed.\n\nSantos also denied that he falsely called himself Jewish, claiming he \u201cnever claimed to be Jewish\u201d but jokingly said he was \u201cJew-ish\u201d to the New York Post. He also falsely claimed that his grandparents \u201csurvived the Holocaust\u201d and fled Europe to escape Jewish persecution. But CNN found that Santos called himself an \u201cAmerican Jew\u201d and \u201cLatino Jew\u201d on multiple occasions. The Republican Jewish Coalition disinvited Santos from appearing at any of its events because he \u201cmisrepresented his heritage.\u201d\n\nDespite the scandals, the New York Republican, who flipped his Long Island seat, said he will take office in January \u2014 spurring calls to resign from Democrats.\n\nHere are some of the outright falsehoods CNN found:\n\nWent to fancy prep school, but left because his family\u2019s real estate imploded\n\nIn appearances, and in an old campaign biography, Santos claimed his parents sent him to Horace Mann, an elite private school in the Bronx.\n\n\u201cHe began Horace Mann preparatory school in the Bronx, however, did not graduate from Horace Mann due to financial difficulties for his family,\u201d his biography read in 2019 for his first campaign for Congress that Santos lost. \u201cHe obtained a GED during his senior year.\u201d\n\nSantos also made the same claim in an appearance on a YouTube show in 2020.\n\n\u201cThey sent me to a good prep school, which was Horace Mann Prep in the Bronx. And, in my senior year of prep school, unfortunately my parents fell on hard times, which was something that would later become known as the depression of 2008. But we were hit a little earlier on with the overleveraging of real estate. And the market started to implode. Um, and the first thing to go was the prep school. You know, you, you can\u2019t afford a $2,500 tuition at that point, right? So anyway, um, I left school, uh, four months to graduation.\u201d\n\nBut the claim is false, according to the school.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve searched the records and there is no evidence that George Santos (or any alias) attended Horace Mann,\u201d Ed Adler, a spokesman for the school, told CNN.\n\nClaimed he criticized Goldman Sachs at private equity conference as an employee\n\n\u201cHave you ever heard of a Goldman Sachs employee take the stage at the largest private equity conference in the world \u2013 SALT, run by Anthony Scaramucci \u2013 and berate their employer? Well, I did that,\u201d Santos said on a local podcast this summer. \u201cAnd I did it in the fashion of renewable energy and global warming. This was the panel I was on. And they\u2019re all talking about solar, wind, and this was back, what, seven years ago now? And I said, you know what, this is a scam. It\u2019s taxpayer money that gets subsidized.\u201d\n\nThe claim is entirely fictional, according to both Goldman Sachs \u2013 which has said Santos never worked there \u2013 and Scaramucci, who runs the conference.\n\nScaramucci told CNN in a message there is not only no record of him appearing on a panel, but no record of him even attending the conference.\n\nClaimed family\u2019s Jewish name was Zabrovsky (and fundraised under it)\n\nIn an appearance on a Fox News digital show in February, Santos said his maternal grandparents changed their Jewish last name from Zabrovsky \u2013 a claim for which there is no evidence and records contradict.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t carry the Ukrainian last name. For a lot of people who are descendants of World War II refugees or survivors of the Holocaust, a lot of names and paperwork were changed in the name of survival. So I don\u2019t carry the family last name that would\u2019ve been Zabrovsky.

{"text": ".. As the National Weather Service (NWS) says, California's already flooded areas may face more trouble. This will be the third \"Atmospheric River\" storm in the state over the past week, and probably the most powerful one. Atmospheric rivers are streams of water in the atmosphere that can stretch for thousands of miles, and they're capable of carrying large amounts of water in the form of snow or rain. It's not unusual to move these rivers in California, but it's often surprising how much rainfall they produce in such a short period of time. The first storm hit California on Saturday night and lasted all day Sunday. The storm brought heavy rain to many parts of the state, some with more than 10 inches of rainfall. The storm also produced large waves along the coast, causing beach erosion and damage to coastal structures. On Monday, a second atmospheric storm hit California. Parts of the state also saw heavy rainfall and flooding, but not as much as the first one. However, the rain from the second storm was enough to trigger additional flooding in already saturated areas. Now, the National Weather Service has warned that a third storm is coming. Forecasters predict it could be the strongest of three, with some areas expected to receive as much as 10 inches or more of rain. The storm is expected to hit on Wednesday night or early Thursday and continue through Friday. The weather service is urging people living in flood-prone areas to be prepared for the worst. People living in these areas are advised to ensure that they have food, water and medicine supplies when required to evacuate. The weather service also asked people to be careful when driving in flood-prone areas. They warned people not to drive through flooded roads, which can be dangerous and cause significant damage. The California Emergency Services Office advises the state's people to take precautions before, during and after a third cyclone strike. They urge people to ensure that any loose items on their property, such as furniture or plantations, are easily blown away or damaged by strong winds. The state's emergency services also require people to keep a close eye on local weather forecasts and warnings, and be prepared to act if necessary. They remind people to pay attention to their surroundings during storms and prepare to move to safety when needed. Clearly, California's flood regions will face a difficult week. A third atmospheric storm could bring more suffering and destruction to areas already affected by the previous two hurricanes.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "On Sunday, Israeli far-right leader Moshe Feiglin visited the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in occupied East Jerusalem, sparking outrage around the world. Ferguson's visit to the Temple Mount marked Israel's first visit to the Holy Land in a decade by far-right leaders. The visit sparked widespread condemnation from Palestinians and their allies, who accused him of trying to challenge their religious and political claims about the site. \"This is an insult to the religious beliefs of Palestinian Muslims and a dangerous provocation,\" Saeb Erekat, Palestine's chief negotiator, said in a statement. \"It is a flagrant violation of the sanctity of the Holy Land and constitutes an act of incitement that could further destabilize the region.\" The Palestinian Authority has called for an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council to address this issue. \"We urge the UN Security Council to act quickly and decisively to stop this threat to international peace and security,\" Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said in a statement. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned Ferguson's visit and vowed to take action against the far-right leader. \"Ferglin's actions violate Israel's long-standing policy, and I will take the necessary steps to ensure that such provocative acts do not happen again,\" Netanyahu said in a statement. The visit sparked a violent clash between Palestinian protesters and Israeli security forces, in which at least 10 Palestinians were injured, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, while Israeli police said several Israeli officers were wounded during the clashes. The Al-Aqsa complex, home to a rock dome and the Al-Aqsa mosque, is believed to be the third holy site in Islam. This site also has religious significance for Jews because it is believed that it was once the site of two ancient Jewish temples. The visit of Feiglin, who is linked to the Jewish extremist party Yisrael Beiteinu, was seen by many Palestinians as an attempt to challenge their religious and political claims about the site. \"This visit is an act of blasphemy and incitement,\" Sheikh Raed Salah, leader of the Islamic Movement for Israel, said in a statement. \"The Israeli Prime Minister must take a firm and decisive stand to prevent such provocations from happening again.\" Arab and Islamic leaders from the region also condemned Feiglin's visit, calling it \"a dangerous provocation\" and a \"blatant violation of the sanctity of the holy sites\". Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he would take \"all necessary measures to protect the Islamic identity of Jerusalem and its holy sites\". Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said Fehringen's visit was \"a serious violation of international law and an insult to the collective feelings of Muslims around the world.\" The incident also sparked a wave of protests in the Arab and Muslim world, with protesters in Jordan, Turkey, Iran and other countries taking to the streets denouncing Feiglin's visit and calling for an end to Israel's occupation of East Jerusalem. Israel has long insisted that holy sites of all religions should be respected, and Netanyahu pledged to continue to respect the status quo at Al-Aqsa compound and will not take further steps to change their status. However, many Palestinians remain concerned about Israel's invasion of the site and view Ferguson's visit as a deliberate provocation. \"We remain committed to ensuring that Al-Aqsa is respected and preserved as a sacred place of worship for Muslims,\" Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah said in a statement. \"We call on the international community to stand with the Palestinian people in the face of these provocations and help us protect our holy sites and rights.\"", "label": "machine"}

{"text": ".. Salesforce, one of the world's largest software companies, is cutting its workforce as the tech giant prepares for a massive executive drain. The San Francisco-based tech giant recently acquired Slack for $27.7 billion and is reportedly preparing for layoffs and restructuring as it shifts its focus to emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing. The layoffs are expected to affect several departments within Salesforce, including sales and marketing, products and engineering. According to sources, the tech giant has begun the process of laying off hundreds of employees, and is expected to announce more in the coming weeks. Salesforce recently announced the departure of co-CEO Keith Block and appointed a new CEO, Bret Taylor. Other notable departures include product chief Jeremy Stanley and cloud operations chief Scott Davis. \"Salesforce's outflow of executives is part of a larger trend toward reducing the company's reliance on traditional enterprise structures and introducing more flexible and peaceful organizational structures,\" said Madeleine MacCready, an analyst at Forrester Research. \"It is clear that Salesforce is seeking to streamline its operations and reduce costs in the face of increased competition and challenging market conditions.\" As Salesforce tries to reduce costs and invest more in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing, the company has made several significant investments in AI over the past year, including the acquisition of Twilio, a cloud-based communications platform. In addition to executive restructuring, the tech giant is reportedly shifting its focus to mobile development as it seeks to expand its market share in enterprise software. Salesforce recently released an open source platform called \"Lightning\", which makes it easier for developers to create apps that run on their phones. \"It's clear that Salesforce wants to invest heavily in mobile development to keep up with the ever-changing landscape of enterprise software,\" said MacCready. \"As businesses around the world become increasingly mobile, Salesforce needs to adapt to changing times to stay competitive.\" Despite news of layoffs and executive departures, Salesforce remains a major player in the enterprise software market.The company recently reported its highest quarterly earnings on record and continues to dominate the customer relationship management software market. The news of the layoffs and restructuring will certainly raise uncertainty among Salesforce employees, but analysts remain optimistic that the company will continue to be a major force in the enterprise software market. \"Salesforce is clearly in transition, but the company has the ability to take advantage of the growing demand for enterprise software,\" MacCready said. \"The company remains a leader in customer relationship management and its investment in mobile development and AI should help it stay ahead in the coming years.\"", "label": "machine"}

And the messaging was terrible: the layoffs were leaked beforehand, yet they didn\u2019t make it public that high performers also lost their jobs.\u201d\n\nSingh\u2019s frustrations were compounded by the fact that he believed his job was relatively safe, especially since he\u2019d never been informed of any performance problem. Plus, as an Indian expatriate on a US work visa, he had just 60 days to find a new role.\n\nAs thousands of colleagues began posting about their layoffs on LinkedIn, Singh followed suit. But despite his consternation at losing his job, and the dread of possibly having to leave the country as a result, the tone of his short message was upbeat and magnanimous. He wrote that although his journey ended prematurely, he agreed with his other colleagues who were gushing on social media that his now-former employer offered \u201ceverything\u201d anyone could want from a workplace. After thanking his ex-teammates, he concluded the post with a line that he was available for work, alongside a picture of his work ID badge.\n\nSingh sounded anything but bitter about the situation \u2013 exactly what he\u2019d intended. \u201cI worked for a social-media company: I know what you post lasts forever,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no upside in writing anything negative about anyone.\u201d\n\nSingh\u2019s LinkedIn post was met with supportive comments from former colleagues who were writing similarly praiseful posts, and his message was seen, sent and shared among recruiters who contacted him about vacancies. \u201cI received my layoff letter at 0600,\u201d he says. \u201cBy 0700, I\u2019d updated my LinkedIn status. By 0800, I was speaking to recruiters.\u201d\n\nIt's early in 2023, but new layoffs are already hitting. And with the lingering predictions of an economic downturn and recession continuing to threaten businesses, there may be more to come. This may also mean more goodbye posts in which workers wax poetic about employers that have just dispassionately cut their jobs. While these messages may contain genuine sentiments, of course, they can also be performative and strategic: serving an important function in displaying a worker\u2019s employability and adaptability.\n\nA strategic move\n\nAfter an initial wave of layoffs at the beginning of the pandemic, many companies rushed to hire new workers, rapidly expanding their teams.\n\nRecently, however, a market slowdown has caused firms to pause recruitment, particularly in technology, where several start-ups and high-growth companies have implemented hiring freezes and, in some cases, even rescinded job offers. In late 2022, some companies also turned to layoffs. Among these were a swath of high-profile cut sat Big Tech firms as well as sectors including finance, retail and media.

Local organizers in Washington say three buses of recent migrant families arrived from Texas near the home in record-setting cold on Christmas Eve. Texas authorities have not confirmed their involvement.\n\nThree buses of recent migrant families arrived from Texas near the home of Vice President Kamala Harris in the record-setting cold on Christmas Eve.\n\nTexas authorities have not confirmed their involvement, but the bus dropoffs are in line with previous actions by border-state governors calling attention to the Biden administration's immigration policies.\n\nThe buses that arrived late Saturday outside the vice president's residence were carrying around 110 to 130 people, according to Tatiana Laborde, managing director of SAMU First Response, a relief agency working with the city of Washington to serve thousands of migrants who have been dropped off in recent months.\n\nLocal organizers had expected the buses to arrive Sunday but found out Saturday that the group would get to Washington early, Laborde said. The people on board included young children.\n\nSome were wearing T-shirts despite temperatures hovering around 15 degrees Fahrenheit (-9 degrees Celsius). It was the coldest Christmas Eve on record for Washington, according to the Washington Post.\n\nLaborde said employees had blankets ready for the people who arrived on Christmas Eve and moved them quickly onto waiting buses for a ride to an area church. A local restaurant chain donated dinner and breakfast.\n\nMost of the arrivals were headed to other destinations and expected to remain in Washington only briefly.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott's office did not respond to a request for comment Sunday morning. His office said last week that Texas has given bus rides to more than 15,000 people since April to Washington, New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia.\n\nAbbott and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, both Republicans, are strong critics of President Joe Biden on his handling of the U.S.-Mexico border, where thousands of people are trying to cross daily, many to seek asylum. Officials on both sides of the border are seeking emergency help in setting up shelters and services for migrants, some of whom are sleeping on the streets.\n\nRepublicans argue Biden and Harris, designated the administration's point person on the root causes of migration, have relaxed restrictions that induced many people to leave their countries of origin. Biden has ended some policies but kept others enacted by former President Donald Trump, whose administration also grappled with spikes in border crossings and at one point separated immigrant families and children as a deterrence initiative.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "In stadium parking lots all across America, people are now gathering to support their favorite football teams, raising the art of tailgating to a sport unto itself\u2014all in a friendly competition to throw the biggest and best shindig before the big game.\n\nAnd what\u2019s a party without great sound? Here\u2019s a selection of wireless and Bluetooth speakers that can fill the great outdoors with music, your team\u2019s pregame show, or even the dulcet baritone of NFL Films legend John Facenda.\n\nSEE ALL Consumer Reports product reviews\n\nTailgate speakers tend to be bulky and heavy, so they might not be ideal for a leisurely stroll about town. But with audio, size often equals superior sound quality.\n\n\"All the speakers in this roundup featured admirable sound quality, and that should be enough to earn them a place in your home after the game,\" says Elias Arias, the head of CR\u2019s wireless speaker testing program.\n\nThese standout speakers have been tested in Consumer Reports dedicated sound lab. Our trained experts evaluated them for ease of use, versatility, and most of all, sound quality. As with all products, every test speaker was purchased anonymously from a retail source. And, of course, we never accept freebies from manufacturers.\n\nThe Boom Box Rebooted\n\nThe JBL Boombox 2 represents a slight upgrade to the original Boombox, which was a digital re-imagining of the giant beat boxes the cool kids\u2014and even LL Cool J\u2014carried around in the 1980s and 90s. But while those behemoths ate D-cell batteries the way competitive eaters down Nathan\u2019s hot dogs, the Boombox 2\u2019s rechargeable battery is good for 24 hours of music, according to JBL. And unlike those old-school boomboxes, the JBL sports an IPX7 water-resistance rating, which means you can submerge it up to 3 meters.\n\nBut instead of old-school cassettes that would warble and occasionally self-destruct, the JBL streams smoothly from your phone via Bluetooth. Sonically, our testers find a very strong resemblance between the new model and the original JBL Boombox. Both feature bass that can rattle the walls\u2014or maybe your neighbor\u2019s fillings\u2014and that\u2019s not entirely a good thing.\n\nWhile our testers give the Boombox 2 a solid score for sound quality, they add a caveat that those robust low frequencies can be overwhelming with some music, explaining that this speaker would have scored even higher with a little less bass. The Boombox 2 might be less than great sitting on a desk in a small office, but its extreme low-frequency impact might be just the thing to pump up the Penn State fight song in the parking lot on a Saturday afternoon.\n\nFrom the Living Room to the Parking Lot\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for really great sound at your tailgate and you\u2019re willing to pay for it, the Ultimate Ears Hyperboom is a great option.\n\nOur testers report that the speaker is both loud and clear, with robust bass and clean midrange, and enough volume for most situations, indoors or out. They find the large controls easy to use, so the model gets good grades for versatility.\n\nThe Hyperboom also features an optical input, which allows it to serve as a TV sound bar or a way to upgrade the sound of a game console. UE claims an IPX4 water-resistance rating for the Hyperboom, which means it\u2019s splashproof and spillproof, but not designed to stand up to a full-fledged dunking.\n\nAlthough the Hyperboom isn\u2019t exactly small\u2014remember that speaker size and sound quality tend to go hand-in-hand\u2014its orientation is vertical, so the footprint is relatively compact, which is a plus at a tailgate. And compared with many top portables, the UE\u2019s styling is subdued, allowing it to be heard but not seen when you return it to your living room after the game.\n\nLights, Sound, and Action!\n\nAs you might expect from the name, Anker\u2019s SoundCore Rave PartyCast is quite the social animal.\n\nWhile the sound isn\u2019t especially refined compared with the very best wireless speakers in our ratings, the sonic flaws are relatively minor. The speaker is quite substantial in size, plays impressively loud, and, the manufacturer claims, it meets IPX 7 water-resistance standards, which allow for a dunk in shallow water\u2014or at least a bout with a spilled drink\u2014without serious harm. All of these features serve the PartyCast well in the parking lot.\n\nOur testers also find the PartyCast quite easy to use, with intuitive, always-on Bluetooth pairing. The model has USB and Aux inputs in case you want to plug in a source rather than streaming your source material. And the PartyCast feature allows you to connect up to 100 of the company\u2019s speakers at once.\n\nIf you want to add visual interest to your tailgate, the speaker has LED lights that sync to the music. And, if you\u2019re so inclined, it can blink to your favorite team\u2019s play-by-play.\n\nSony's Better-sounding Sibling\n\nHere\u2019s why reviews by Consumer Reports can be so important in making a purchasing decision. The Sony XG300 is very similar in appearance and design to the larger XG500, so you\u2019d expect that the two models would perform similarly, too.\n\nBut the XG300 is actually one of the better-sounding portable speakers we\u2019ve tested, with bass that\u2019s got a decent amount of sock and a clear, even midrange. By contrast, the bigger and more expensive XG500 fell short of its smaller sibling with bass that\u2019s kind of boomy while that all-important midrange is muffled.\n\nAnd while it\u2019s somewhat smaller than other models in this roundup, the XG300 does what you want in a tailgating speaker with decent volume, IP67 water resistance, and a rechargeable battery that delivers 25 hours of battery life, according to Sony.\n\nBig, Beefy, and Value-priced\n\nIf you want a speaker that\u2019s inexpensive, easy to transport, and checks most of the boxes you want for tailgating, then the ION Sport XL should be on your shopping list.\n\nIt\u2019s large and boxy and weighs just under 25 pounds, but, to help you manage that mass, it\u2019s got wheels, a roller-bag-style handle, as well as grab handles on the side. It\u2019s also IPX 5 water-resistant, says ION, which means it can withstand a light spill or a rain shower.\n\nSonically, the speaker provides enough volume to fill a large room, and the bass has decent impact, although the lowest bass notes don\u2019t go as deep as those on some other models. One of the handier features on the ION is an AM-FM tuner that allows you to tap into the local play-by-play during the game or find your favorite sports talk station and hear Vinnie from Queens rant about that controversial fourth-down call.\n\nConsumer Reports is an independent, nonprofit organization that works side by side with consumers to create a fairer, safer, and healthier world.

{"text": "On January 8, 2023, the Bear Organization faced considerable uncertainty after hiring a new general manager, Ryan Poles, earlier this year. It's been three months since the Bears used Poles to replace Ryan Pace, who is now gone, and while the front desk has remained relatively quiet, the big moves expected have yet to happen. The move to put the Poles at the head of the team should mark a new era in the history of the franchise, where the Bears will soon become a serious Super Bowl competitor. So far, this vision has not been realized. The Pole has been publicly stating that he intends to restore the Bears' relevance. He is also very active in the team's reconnaissance, and works with coaches and executives to create new strategies and games. But the fact remains that no major moves have taken place, and the team is still in a state of fluctuation. The Bears have several options, but none seem particularly inspiring. They can maintain their current squad and hope that the team will be able to turn things around on their own. They can add new talent through free agency or draft selection, which may be difficult despite a lack of wage ceiling space at present. Alternatively, they can seek deals to gain more talent. However, given their current lack of assets and market unpredictability, this may also be a risk proposition. Obviously, the Bears have a long way to go before they can be a successful team, but Ryan Poles and the front office's lack of activity put the team in an uncertain position. No one expected a quick turnaround, but the team needed to take some steps to capitalize on the fact that they had a new general manager with new visions. Until then, the Bears would be in a stalemate and wait to see which direction it went next.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "A pilot walks past the windows at the newly renovated Delta terminal D at LaGuardia Airport in New York March 6, 2021.\n\nDelta Air Lines and its pilots' union have reached a preliminary agreement for raises topping 30% over four years, a milestone deal that could sharply drive up aviators' pay across the industry.\n\nPilots' unions and airlines across the U.S. have been in tense negotiations for months if not years, as crews seek more compensation and better schedules.\n\nDelta pilots voted in October to authorize a strike if a deal wasn't reached, while pilots at several airlines have picketed this year demanding contract improvements. Delta and the union were edging toward a deal in mid-November, CNBC reported.\n\nUnions have complained about grueling schedules as travel snapped back from a pandemic slump. Delta and other U.S. carriers are profitable again, but a shortage of trained pilots has hampered carriers' recovery and contributed to higher airfare. It also gives pilots more power in contract negotiations. Labor and fuel are airlines' top two expenses.\n\nThe \"agreement-in-principle\" Delta reached with the Air Line Pilots Association is equal to $7.2 billion in cumulative value over four years, the union told members in an email late Friday. About a quarter of that is tied to quality-of-life improvements.\n\nThe agreement includes an 18% increase on the day the contract is signed, then a 5% increase one year later and two 4% raises in each of the following years. It also includes a one-time payment of 4% of 2020 and 2021 pay each, plus 14% of 2022 pay.\n\n\"We are pleased to have reached an agreement in principle for a new pilot contract, one that recognizes the contributions of our pilots to Delta's success,\" a Delta spokesman said in an emailed statement.\n\nAttempts at deals at American Airlines and United Airlines have so far failed but Delta's agreement could push talks along.\n\n\"We will take other carriers' ratified agreements, including United's, into account and update our pay proposals quickly when details are known,\" American's CEO Robert Isom said in a video message to pilots in June.\n\nThe Delta agreement said pay rates will exceed United's and American's pay by at least 1% over the course of the agreement, which still needs union and pilot approval.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "We all face demanding days that seem designed to test our self-control. Perhaps you are a barista, and you have some particularly rude and demanding customers, but you manage to keep your poise throughout. Or maybe you are finishing an important project and you have to remain in quiet concentration, without letting your attention slip to other distractions. If you are on a diet, you might have spent the past few hours resisting the cookie jar while the sweet treats silently whisper \u201ceat me\u201d.\n\nIn each case, you would have relied on your willpower, which psychologists define as the ability to avoid short-term temptations and override unwanted thoughts, feelings or impulses. And some people seem to have much greater reserves of it than others: they find it easier to control their emotions, avoid procrastination and stick to their goals, without ever seeming to lose their iron grip on their behaviour. Indeed, you may know some lucky people who, after a hard day at work, have the resolve to do something productive like a workout \u2013 while you give up on your fitness goals and fall for the temptations of junk food and trash TV.\n\nOur reserves of self-control and mental focus appear to be shaped by mindsets. And new studies suggest powerful strategies for anyone to build greater willpower \u2013 with huge benefits for your health, productivity and happiness.\n\nThe depleted ego\n\nUntil recently, the prevailing psychological theory proposed that willpower resembled a kind of battery. You might start the day with full strength, but each time you have to control your thoughts, feelings or behaviour, you zap that battery\u2019s energy. Without the chance to rest and recharge, those resources run dangerously low, making it far harder to maintain your patience and concentration, and to resist temptation.\n\nLaboratory tests appeared to provide evidence for this process; if participants were asked to resist eating cookies left temptingly on a table, for example, they subsequently showed less persistence when solving a mathematical problem, because their reserves of willpower had been exhausted. Drawing on the Freudian term for the part of the mind that is responsible for reining in our impulses, this process was known as \u201cego depletion\u201d. People who had high self-control might have bigger reserves of willpower initially, but even they would be worn down when placed under pressure.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "In recent weeks, England's Accident and Emergency Department (A&E) buffer zone has worsened, with thousands of patients waiting to see a record number of ambulances queuing outside the hospital. New data released by NHS England shows that the number of ambulances lining up outside the A&E department hit a record high in the week ending Jan. 21, at 32,541, up from 24,620 the previous week. The data also show that in the week ending January 21, nearly 8,500 people were forced to wait more than 30 minutes outside A&E departments before being handed over to hospital staff. This is twice the number of patients who had to endure long delays the previous week. The data also showed that 6,939 people entered the hospital via ambulance in the week ending Jan. 21, an increase of 12% over the previous week. These figures come at a time when there are reports that hospital staff have been unable to cope with the demand, especially as Royal Liverpool University Hospital is struggling to keep up. Although the number of ambulance visits has increased, the National Health Service (NHS England) said that the proportion of patients seen within four hours in the A&E department \"remains unchanged\" at 84.9%. This figure has been higher than 85% for the past six weeks. NHS England Chief Executive Officer Simon Stevens said the figures showed pressure on health services. \"Today's data shows that the pressure on NHS services across the country has been dropping,\" he said. \"It's encouraging that the proportion of patients seen within four hours at A&E has remained unchanged since the beginning of this year, but the number of ambulances queuing in line is a record, reflecting the increased pressure our hospital feels.\" The news comes amid warnings from NHS bosses and medical leaders that hospitals are becoming increasingly strained and unable to cope with demand. NHS providers, a trade body at British hospitals, said the record number of ambulances lining up outside the A&E department was \"a worrying development.\" Chris Hopson, CEO of NHS provider, said: \"British hospitals are experiencing a crisis of A&E overcrowding, with more than 30,000 ambulances waiting outside the A&E department for the first time in history. \"The A&E four-hour standard remains above 85% for the sixth week in a row, but the high and increasing number of ambulances waiting outside the A&E department, as well as the number of patients waiting outside for more than 30 minutes, further demonstrate how crowded our emergency department is.\" \"We know that NHS staff are struggling to manage the crisis, and these numbers show how far we still need to go to address this issue.\" NHS England said it was taking \"a range of steps\" to ease pressure in the A&E sector. The company said it was working with hospitals to increase the number of available beds and provide additional funding for hospitals to improve their ability to treat patients faster. It also said it was ensuring that the Ambulance Trust had sufficient resources and staff to respond to growing demand. Meanwhile, a report released by the National Audit Office (NAO) earlier this month showed that England's A&E department failed to meet its goal of treating patients within four hours for the third year in a row. The report found that the A&E department in England treated nearly 90% of patients within four hours in 2017/18, down from 92% in 2016/17. NAO warned that failing to meet this target could mean thousands of patients waiting longer than they should be receiving treatment. News of increased demand for the A&E sector will further hit the already struggling NHS, where the Department of Health and Social Care recorded more than 40,000 overdose deaths in England and Wales during the peak of the coronavirus pandemic. The latest data shows that there is an urgent need to reduce the pressure on the A&E department and ensure that hospitals have the resources they need to provide safe and effective care for patients. Without urgent action by the NHS and the government, these numbers could only continue to deteriorate over the coming weeks and months.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": ".. The concept of trying to time the market is one of the oldest and most debated in investment. This year's S&P 500 index rose by 13.5%, with all major averages rising sharply, so it seems that the timing of the market has played a role. According to the Bespoke Investment Group, the top five single-day losses of the S&P 500 in 2020 accounted for more than 80% of the index's total losses that year. If you exclude the worst day of the year - March 12, when the index fell 9.5% - it will rise by 14.5% instead of 13.5%. In other words, if you don't have a market in five days this year, your year may be much better than constantly trading in and out. That's not to say that the market isn't volatile, or that it's not worth trading - but reminding people that those who try to time the market often take too many risks. In terms of the S&P 500's losses, the worst five days in 2020 are March 12 (-9.5%), September 3 (-5.6%), October 8 (-4.4%), June 11 (-4.4%) and December 21 (-4.1%). All this suggests that these five days already account for more than 83% of total S&P 500 losses in 2020. So, despite various geopolitical tensions, pandemics and controversial presidential elections, it's no surprise that the market has been relatively stable this year. While there have been brief rebounds on some days, markets have largely recovered, especially since their April lows. If you buy index funds and just sit tight, the odds are good that you'll end up with a positive return in the long run. As 2020 shows, those who try to time-adjusted their markets are more likely to eventually suffer losses. This does not mean that there is no room for trading or investment strategies, but it does mean you should treat them with caution. With the S&P 500 rising this year and such large losses concentrated in just five days, it's clear that market timing isn't as easy as it seems. It's not hard to see why trying to time the market hasn't been successful. Investors should learn from this year's experience: Market timing is often a risky endeavor, and can lead to huge losses. It is important to understand that investing is a long-term game, and you should pay attention to factors such as the quality of returns, valuations, and macroeconomic trends. If you are investing, then take a long-term approach and ensure that you remain diverse and satisfied with the level of risk involved.", "label": "machine"}

While the industry as a whole readied for a spending downturn that's expected to last well into 2023, some firms, like agency holding companies, actually had stronger-than-expected results. The unstable economy also pushed non-advertising companies, like retailers and Netflix, to hurriedly ramp up nascent ad businesses.\n\nIndustry experts spoke with Insider and revealed their biggest shockers of 2022, and what it means for 2023.\n\nThe ad industry crashed, and probably won't recover in 2023\n\nAlex DeGroote, research director at Arden Partners, said the sharp ad spending slowdown largely reflects the Russian-Ukrainian war's drag on global economic growth, which was 6% in 2021, down to 3.2% in 2022, and is projected to be 2.7% in 2023.\n\nThe sudden collapse of Crypto-related ad budgets, once an industry bright spot, also dragged down ad spending.\n\nDeGroote believes the 2023 ad market growth forecasts from major ad buyers like GroupM (5.9% growth), and Magna (5% growth to $822 billion) are too optimistic.\n\n\"In a period of mega-high inflation, price promotion (discounting) on goods may be a more useful marketing tactic for some companies rather than mainstream advertising,\" he said.\n\nMeta and YouTube weren't immune to ad declines, but ad holding companies were\u2026 so far\n\nGoogle's and Meta's immunity to harsh economic conditions might be over, according to a November research note from Enders Analysis.\n\nThe note pointed out that even though Google and Meta have some factors in their favor, like a strong dollar, Google parent Alphabet's growth rate is at one of its lowest points ever, and Meta's growth rate is at its lowest.\n\n\"They are in for a protracted period of relative pain, though the real year-on-year growth of the big two will likely reach a short-term minimum,\" according to the note.\n\nYouTube, which had been one of Google's biggest growth engines, posted its first-ever year-over-year decline in October, and Google's ad revenue dipped $2 billion from the second to third quarter, as advertisers cut spend.\n\nMeta, has also seen its ad revenue decline, and has dumped $4 billion so far into building a so-called Metaverse, which hasn't driven any revenue yet. It's placed a big bet on a short-form video product called Reels to help resuscitate its ad revenue, but so far that hasn't captured any thunder from rival TikTok.\n\nApple's policies around consumer privacy have also cost ad businesses like Google and Meta billions.\n\nBut while the tech platforms flailed, the advertising holding companies over-performed. Agencies didn't enjoy the anomalous growth the tech giants saw during the pandemic, so they're not impacted as much by the current course correction, according to the Enders note.\n\nThat being said, the Enders note cautions that agencies' reprieve will end in 2023: \"The story for advertising as a whole is that growth is objectively weakening, and even agencies are now mostly seeing slowing growth after the post-2021 recovery.\"\n\nNetflix and every other streaming service launched ads \u2014 but that might not help advertisers\n\nNetflix had been so publicly opposed to advertising that the industry was taken aback when it changed tack this year, partnering with Microsoft's Xandr unit to expedite the launch of an ad business.\n\nNetflix joined a throng of companies vying for streaming ad dollars this year, including NBCUniversal's Peacock, Disney Plus, and HBO Max. These companies are using ads to offer cheaper subscription prices.\n\nAt the same time, consumers could be put off by the tyranny of choice.\n\n\"Consumers are being overwhelmed by a number of platforms, subscriptions, and prices,\" said David Helmreich, chief commercial officer at the TV adtech company Innovid. 2023 will see more fragmentation as content owners launch different bundles to try to attract subscribers, which will make it more difficult for consumers to find the content they want to watch. That fragmentation will also create more challenges for advertisers in measuring the effectiveness of their ads across multiple platforms, Helmreich said.\n\nDeGroote also predicts that this deluge of streaming ad offerings won't attract the younger consumers that advertisers want to reach the most. \"The reality is consumers under 30 years old greatly prefer short-form video over longer Netflix series,\" he said. This bodes well for TikTok's growth next year, he said.\n\nNew ad sellers like Best Buy exploded into the mainstream \u2014 but will have to prove their value in 2023\n\nCompanies who aren't thought to be ad sellers, like Uber and Best Buy all built ad businesses en masse this year.\n\n\"Everything is, or could be, an ad network, and they will be addressable,\" said Chad Engelgau, Global CEO of Acxiom. \"Anything that requires an email address to access, including your Apple devices, can and will serve ads.\"\n\nMost of the companies launching ad businesses are retailers, which created a lucrative category called retail media \u2014 one that GroupM estimates will be worth $160 billion by 2027. Adtech firms like Criteo staked the future of their businesses around retail media, and others like The Trade Desk are aggressively trying to horn in to snatch retail ad dollars.\n\nRetail media providers are hoping to snatch budget from advertisers who are having trouble finding consumers due to Apple's privacy policies and the loss of third-party cookies. Yet, with so many options, and a tough economic situation, retailers will have to really stand out to grab ad dollars in 2023. Many, like Kroger, are hoping to dip into budget that had previously been earmarked for TV.\n\nElon Musk acquires Twitter\n\nMusk's acquisition of Twitter \u2014 and subsequent decimation of its employee ranks, including its revenue-driving advertising operations \u2014 shook the ad industry.\n\nSince taking over, Musk appointed Twitter vet Robin Wheeler to head up advertising, and subsequently fired her. Chris Riedy then assumed the role in late November, to convince vacating advertisers to stay.\n\n\"We are hopeful that the new management at Twitter will be able to strike a healthy balance of content moderation, safety and transparency to enable it to thrive on behalf of consumers, marketers, and society in 2023,\" said David Cohen, CEO of the IAB, an ad industry trade group.", "label": "human"}

But your body can still go its own way\n\nWhen it comes to comfort, cushioning may well make the wearer feel good. However, whether it can help prevent injury is another matter.\n\nA professor of biomechanics from the Norwegian School of Sports Science, Dr Hannah Rice looks at how people walk and run with a view to understanding injury risk. She tells Greg that the preoccupation with cushioning and measures to prevent pronation (how much your foot moves inwards when you run) could be misleading.\n\nShe also explains that recent research under the banner of the 'preferred movement path paradigm' suggests that \"whatever shoe you put a person in, the skeleton will follow a particular path during running and you're not really able to change it with footwear or with insoles\".\n\n4. Improved performance doesn't mean improved fitness\n\nPaying more to prevent injury may be a grey area, but performance is another matter. Sports technologist Professor Mike Caine explains that in the shoes worn by the likes of Kenyan long-distance runner Eliud Kipchoge, the heel strike \u2013 the point at which the runner first hits the ground \u2013 is losing the wearer less energy.\n\nBy contrast, wearing a more typical, spongy shoe means you would lose more energy when decelerating. As Mike explains, \"in terms of running quickly, that\u2019s not very efficient\".\n\nThe Alphafly shoes have a carbon fibre plate or stiffening plate that changes the dynamic at the next stage of the running motion \u2013 rolling the foot forward and over the big toe joint and pushing off from the toes. These plates maximise the amount of energy that\u2019s pushing the foot forward. The combination of this propulsion and the saved energy are \"significant enough to add a small benefit to athletes that are looking to run faster, particularly at high speeds\".\n\nHowever, this improved performance means a reduced level of effort, a lower energy demand resulting in a less effective workout. That's important if you\u2019re going for a 30-minute run on your lunch break to stay in shape.", "label": "human"}
{"text": ".. Iran said on Monday it had successfully thwarted a massive cyberattack against its central bank, highlighting the country's growing concern about digital threats from abroad and rising tensions with the United States and its allies. The Central Bank of Iran (CBI) said in a statement it had detected and stopped the attack earlier this month, claiming that it was launched by a group of hackers from abroad. \"The purpose of this attack was to disrupt CBI's financial network and access bank accounts belonging to other banks,\" the statement said. The statement did not specify who was behind the attack or what kind of damage it caused, but noted that Iranian experts were able to identify and block the software before any damage could be caused by the malware. \"Because of Iran's cyber capabilities, the attack was neutralized before causing any damage to the bank's database,\" it said. The statement comes amid a series of cyber-attacks targeting Iranian government agencies. In June, the country accused Israel of launching a malicious cyber attack on a major petrochemical facility in the south of the country, but Israel denied this claim. In recent years, Iran has also been the target of a series of malware attacks, including Stuxnet, which targeted the country's nuclear facilities in 2010. The widely blamed US and Israeli attack is believed to have successfully destroyed some of the country's nuclear centrifuges. The Iranian government has vowed to combat such threats, and in recent years has invested heavily in cybersecurity measures. In 2018, the country launched a new National Cyber Defense Center, reportedly set up to detect and deter cyber attacks against the state. Iran is also seeking Russian help to strengthen its cyber defenses, and the two countries recently signed a cooperation agreement in this area. Under the terms of the agreement, Moscow will help Iran enhance its cyber defenses so that it can better detect, prevent and respond to malicious cyber activity. The CBI's statement on Monday stressed that Iran is concerned about cyber threats from abroad and is determined to protect itself from malicious activity. \"This incident demonstrates the need to remain vigilant, especially at this sensitive time when foreign actors are actively trying to destabilize Iran's economy,\" it said. The statement also reminds banks and other financial institutions of any suspicious activity, and warns that anyone found to be engaged in illegal activities will face serious consequences. It's not clear who was behind the recent attack on the CBI, but Tehran has long accused the United States and its allies of trying to undermine its economy through cyberattacks. Washington strongly denied the allegations, although it acknowledged that it had made cyber operations part of its \"maximum pressure\" policy on Iran. The alleged attack on the CBI is only the latest example of the potential consequences of these measures. It highlights the importance of protecting oneself from cyber threats, and the need for countries to work together to prevent malicious activities by foreign actors.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Disney (DIS) CEO Bob Iger has five big questions to address in the new year as he settles in, once again, to the high-powered executive role.\n\nThe company saw shares slide roughly 45% in 2022, marking the worst annual stock performance for the House of Mouse since 1974.\n\nIt's a much different story compared to March 2021 when the share price peaked at just under $202 as the stay-at-home trade boosted consumer-facing media giants and its fledgling streaming service Disney+ saw early subscriber success.\n\nNow, as rising costs, debt-ridden balance sheets, and a renewed focus on profitability weigh on the media sector overall, Iger must navigate a bruised business beset with leadership challenges, unfavorable price increases, and a direct-to-consumer division struggling to turn a profit.\n\nHow do you make the streaming business profitable?\n\nThe first and most important question Iger must address? Streaming profitability.\n\n\"Streaming losses [are] the absolute number one issue on hand,\" Geetha Ranganathan, senior media analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, previously told Yahoo Finance Live. \"We've seen the streaming business at Disney already lose about $8 billion. They're expected to lose another $3 billion in fiscal 2023, so obviously Bob Iger really has to go back and articulate a much better strategy.\"\n\nIn late November, Iger gave investors a taste of what seemed to be the first step of that strategy \u2014 firing Kareem Daniel and restructuring Disney's Media and Entertainment Distribution (DMED) division, one of former CEO Bob Chapek's first big swings.\n\n\"As you know, this is a time of enormous change and challenges in our industry, and our work will also focus on creating a more efficient and cost-effective structure,\" Iger said at the time of the reorganization.\n\nWalt Disney CEO Bob Iger attends the European premiere of \"The Lion King\" in London, Britain July 14, 2019. REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nIn its most recent fiscal year, losses for Disney's direct-to-consumer unit, which includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, totaled $4 billion for the year. High content costs were largely to blame as the company upped its content budget by $8 billion in 2022 to a whopping $33 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nManagement said it expects streaming losses to shrink by about $200 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2023 before reaching profitability in fiscal 2024.\n\nOne way the company plans to stick to that timeline is through layoffs and hiring freezes first implemented by Chapek shortly before his ouster.\n\nIger, while speaking at a town hall with employees, revealed there were no plans to reverse the hiring freeze as he continues to evaluate Disney's current cost structure \u2014 an evaluation investors will be hyper-focused on in 2023.\n\nWill Disney buy out Comcast's stake in Hulu?\n\nAs Iger charts a path to streaming profitably, he will likely have to decide the fate of streaming giant Hulu.\n\nDisney owns two-thirds of Hulu with Comcast's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal controlling the rest. Under the terms of the 2019 agreement, which set Disney's guaranteed minimum equity value for Hulu at $27.5 billion, Comcast could require Disney to buy out its stake as early as January 2024.\n\nWhich is what NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell said he expects will happen.\n\n\"We have a put, they have a call,\" Shell said at an investor conference last month. \"We think [Hulu] is worth a lot of money because it's sold on a full control basis as if you were auctioning it off. And I think [there are] no indications that anything else is going to happen [other] than Disney writing us a big check for the asset in 2024.\"\n\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.\n\nSome analysts, however, have suggested Disney could sell its majority stake to help offset accelerating streaming losses amid an ultra-competitive landscape.\n\n\"Personally, I think selling Hulu would be a good idea,\" Doug Creutz, senior analyst at Cowen, previously told Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nThe analyst, who said Hulu is \"not a Disney-branded product,\" explained the media giant \"would be better off really focusing on the strengths of the company \u2014 that branded, high-quality, family content, rather than trying to be everything to everybody.\"\n\nLightshed Partners\u2019 Richard Greenfield agreed, writing in a November blog post: \"Hulu\u2019s actual worth is unclear if Disney wants to keep the Hulu original programming created by Disney for Disney+.\"\n\n\"Essentially, Iger has to decide on a streaming strategy,\" Greenfield said. \"Does Disney want to run multiple streaming services as they do now, focus all their energy on a vertically-integrated and more narrow Disney+ strategy or do they envision a world with just one 'everything' Disney service (combining Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+)?\"\n\nESPN: Keep or spin off?\n\nIn addition to Hulu, media analysts have long questioned the murky future of ESPN and whether or not Disney should consider spinning off the popular sports network \u2014 a suggestion previously made by Third Point's Dan Loeb.\n\nLoeb argued ESPN would have greater flexibility to pursue business initiatives, such as sports betting, if it were not part of Disney.\n\n\"DIS will begin the spin-off process for ESPN & ABC including launching ESPN in streaming a la carte,\" Wells Fargo analyst Steve Cahall wrote in a note published late last month. \"Cost rationalization and balance sheet options are critical to reaching this outcome. The result is a better-off remaining DIS.\"\n\nBut not everyone agrees.\n\n\"We're very much against spinning off ESPN... that's the dumbest thing ever,\" Jason Bazinet, managing director at Citi, previously told Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nBazinet went on to explain ESPN has the potential to be a much bigger global business, especially if Disney chooses to leverage the internet for distribution. He also said the network generates the bulk of Disney's cash flow, which will ultimately fund its pivot to direct-to-consumer and help offset accelerating streaming losses.\n\n\"What Disney is embarking upon with a direct-to-consumer business is very much like a cable company or a telecom company,\" Bazinet said, stressing how DTC bridges the gap between the consumer and sports rights. \"They should not spin it off.\"\n\nIn its most recent fiscal year, Disney's operating income for its Linear Networks segment \u2014 which includes ESPN \u2014 totaled $8.52 billion.\n\nParks: Will Iger do away with Chapek-era price hikes?\n\nFollowing earlier price hikes in February 2022, Disney again raised prices for most of its Florida theme parks on December 8, upping the costs of single-day and multi-day tickets, in addition to the renewals for its annual pass program, the Genie+ app, merchandise, food, and other in-park purchases.\n\nThe price hikes, which were already in effect at Disneyland Anaheim, were a cause of widespread backlash during former CEO Bob Chapek's tenure.\n\nDisney fans angered by recent price hikes at its theme parks\n\nEven Iger was reportedly taken aback by the sharp increases.\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, the executive was \"alarmed by increases in prices at Disney theme parks that Mr. Chapek argued would boost revenue and limit overcrowding.\"\n\nDisney's theme parks missed expectations in its latest quarter as recession fears pressured consumer demand. Revenue from the company's parks, experiences, and consumer products division came in at $7.43 billion (vs. estimates of $7.59 billion), with operating income hitting $1.51 billion (vs. estimates of $1.9 billion.)\n\nAlthough it is unlikely that Iger will reverse the price hikes, could Disney fans see a reduction in the number of increases in 2023?\n\nWho will be the next Disney CEO?\n\nEven though Iger just regained his CEO position, investors are already thinking about his replacement.\n\nRumors have swirled that internal candidates like Dana Walden, Disney General Entertainment Content Chairman, Alan Bergman, Walt Disney Studios Chairman, or Josh D'Amaro, Disney Parks, Experiences and Products Chairman, could be next in line.\n\nOther possibilities include former employees Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs, who left the company in 2020 after being passed over by Iger for the CEO role that ultimately went to Chapek.\n\nMayer and Staggs currently run Blackstone-backed entertainment startup Candle Media, which recently acquired Reese Witherspoon\u2019s Hello Sunshine production company in a deal worth $900 million. Could Iger possibly purchase Candle Media to lure back Mayer and Staggs?\n\nWhatever occurs, analysts have said Iger's surprise return will likely complicate the journey in finding a long-term CEO.\n\n\"For Iger to come back after just a few years and retake control, whoever is the next CEO of Disney, they're going to be looking over their shoulder from day one wondering if they're really the CEO of the company or if they're going to get pushed out like Chapek did,\" Doug Cruetz, media analyst at Cowen, previously told Yahoo Finance Live.\n\n\"That's not a great position for Disney to be in if they're trying to find a person who can lead the company successfully, starting in 2024 and forward,\" he cautioned.\n\nDisney's top contenders to succeed CEO Bob Iger\n\nAlexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Media Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Attacks earlier on Saturday had hit residential buildings and a hotel in the capital, killing at least one person and injuring more than 20.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink said on Twitter: \"Russia coldly and cowardly attacked Ukraine in the early hours of the new year. But Putin still does not seem to understand that Ukrainians are made of iron.\"\n\nAt the front line in Urkaine's eastern Donetsk Province, troops toasted the new year. Soldier Pavlo Pryzhehodskiy, 27, played a song on guitar he had written at the front after 12 of his comrades were killed in a single night.\n\n\"It is sad that instead of meeting friends, celebrating and giving gifts to one another people were forced to seek shelter, some were killed,\" he told Reuters. \"It is a huge tragedy. It is a huge tragedy that cannot ever be forgiven. That is why the New Year is sad.\"\n\nIn a nearby front line trench, soldier Oleh Zahrodskiy, 49, said he had signed up as a volunteer after his son was called up to fight as a reservist. His son was now in a hospital in the southern city of Dnipro, fighting for his life with a brain injury, while his father manned the front.\n\n\"It is very tough now,\" he said, holding back tears.\n\n'HAPPY NEW YEAR'\n\nAndrii Nebytov, chief of Kyiv's police, posted a photo on his Telegram messaging app, showing what was described as a piece of drone used in an attack on the capital, with a hand-written sign on it in Russian saying \"Happy New Year\".\n\n\"This wreckage is not at the front, where fierce battles are taking place, this is here, on a sports grounds, where children play,\" Nebytov said.\n\nRussia has flattened Ukrainian cities and killed thousands of civilians since Putin ordered his invasion in February, claiming Ukraine was an artificial state whose pro-Western outlook threatened Russia's security.

In recent weeks, the front lines have been largely static, with thousands of soldiers dying in intense trench warfare as Moscow defends its grip on captured territory.\n\nSince October, Russia has launched mass missile and drone attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, casting cities into darkness and cold as winter sets in. Moscow says the strikes aim to reduce Ukraine's ability to fight; Kyiv says they have no military purpose and are intended to hurt civilians, a war crime.\n\n\"The main thing is the fate of Russia,\" a stern-faced Putin said in his New Year's Eve address, speaking in front of a group of people dressed in military uniform instead of the normal backdrop of the Kremlin walls. \"Defence of the fatherland is our sacred duty to our ancestors and descendants. Moral, historical righteousness is on our side.\"\n\nZelenskiy delivered his own address in near darkness, in front of a fluttering Ukrainian flag. He described the year past as a national awakening.\n\n\"We were told: you have no other option but to surrender. We say: we have no other option than to win,\" he said.\n\n\"This year has struck our hearts. We've cried out all the tears. We've shouted all the prayers,\" Zelenskiy said. \"We fight and will continue to fight. For the sake of the key word: 'victory'.\"\n\nThe latest air strikes damaged infrastructure in Sumy, in the northeast of the country, Khmelnytskyi in the west and Zaporizhzhia and Kherson in southeast and south, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said.\n\n\"Let the day be quiet,\" Valentyn Reznichenko, governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region said early on Sunday, after reporting heavy shelling of several communities in the region overnight that wounded one.\n\nGrid operator Ukrenergo said on Sunday the past day had been \"difficult\" for its workers but that the electricity situation was \"under control\" and emergency outages were not being implemented.\n\n\"Additional volumes of electricity for household consumers have been provided thanks to the concious behavior of Ukrainian business and restrictions on the work of industry,\" it said in a statement.\n\nSeparately, Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the southern Russian region of Belgorod bordering Ukraine, said overnight shelling of the outskirts of Shebekino town had damaged houses but there were no casualties.\n\nRussian media also reported multiple Ukrainian attacks on the Moscow-controlled parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, with local officials saying at least nine people were wounded.\n\nRussia's RIA state news agency cited a local doctor as saying six people were killed when a hospital in Donetsk was attacked on Saturday.

{"text": "TikTok has quickly become one of the most popular social media sites for young people around the world. Over the past year, the app's users and content have skyrocketed. Like any popular platform, trends come and go. This year, it is entirely about health trends, with no signs of slowing down. Best: The Yoga Challenge One of TikTok's most popular health trends in 2022 is the Yoga Challenge. It has been around for several years, but this year it really caught fire. The Yoga Challenge allows users to practice various yoga poses and record results over a short period of time. The more challenging the posture, the better the effect. This is a simple and fun way to get into yoga, helping build core strength and balance. Worst of all: fake health therapy. Unfortunately, not all of TikTok's health content has been beneficial this year. There is a plethora of fake health treatments and recommendations emerging on the app, including claims that certain foods or supplements can cure serious illnesses, as well as unsafe DIY treatments and massage techniques. Thankfully, TikTok has taken steps to block such content and is actively working to remove it from the app. Best: Self-Help on Sunday One of the biggest health trends this year is the Self-Care Sunday Challenge, which encourages users to spend some time focused on taking care of themselves during their daily activities on Sunday. Participants can do anything that makes them feel good, such as taking a shower, putting on a mask for themselves, or even just sitting down and relaxing for a few minutes. Worst: Virtual Detoxification The idea behind this trend is that you spend a certain amount of time \"detoxifying\" your life without technology or social media. However, many experts warn that such detoxification can be unhealthy and inefficient. Best of all: Mental Health Challenges Mental health is an important issue, and it's great to see TikTok users embrace this trend in 2022. Mental health challenges encourage users to talk openly about their feelings and be honest about their struggles. These challenges help promote a healthy attitude towards mental health, and reduce the sense of shame when talking about it. Overall, TikTok's health trends in 2022 have their fair share of rising and falling. But overall, users seem to be using the platform primarily to focus on self-care and mental health. This can only be a good thing, because it is important to remember to take care of yourself.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The Rules. EU regulators have ordered tech giant Meta to reassess the legal basis of its rules for online personalized advertising, the latest move in a crackdown on digital platforms that raise privacy concerns. The European Commission, the EU's executive branch, had previously refused to comply with a ruling earlier in July 2020 that it should stop using personalized advertising as part of its services. The committee said it had asked the company to \"rethink the legal basis of its personalized advertising rules.\" Meta has become one of the most popular advertising and marketing products and services platforms, especially those related to search, travel and booking services. The European Commission said it was concerned about the lack of a legal basis for Meta's rules on personalized ads, including individuals' right to opt out of such ads and access to tracking mechanisms such as cookies and identifiers. It said the company did not provide convincing evidence that these rules are in line with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR, which protects the privacy and data protection rights of EU citizens, is a cornerstone of the EU's digital economy. The European Commission said it also ordered Meta to take action to ensure its practices are in line with GDPR and other EU legislation, including e-privacy regulations. It said the company should ensure that ads are targeted based on user consent and other legitimate interests, provide clear information about the data used to target ads, and notify users when using their personal data. Meta is one of several technology companies that have been attacked by European authorities in recent months, and they are stepping up efforts to ensure that data-driven services such as online advertising are fair and protect consumers. In November 2020, the European Commission fined Google EUR4.3 billion for using its Android mobile operating system to cement its dominance in search advertising. Last December, Apple paid Ireland 1.2 billion euros in tax refunds for illegal tax arrangements. That same month, it fined Microsoft for violating GDPR because the company failed to tell users they had a right to oppose targeted advertising. The commission said its investigation into Meta was ongoing, that it was \"monitoring the implementation of legal requirements\" and prepared to take further action if necessary. It also said it was working with other EU member states and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to investigate potential competition issues related to advertising personalization on the Meta platform. The move comes as the EU prepares to review the first wave of legislation passed over the past four years to ensure companies comply with new privacy and data protection rules. The review will focus on how businesses use personal data in online services, including personalized advertising, and how they impact competition in the digital marketplace. Meta said it had \"fully cooperated\" with the committee's request and was working to ensure that it fully complied with all applicable regulations. It added that it had taken \"significant\" steps to protect user privacy and comply with GDPR, including the introduction of a new privacy policy and a selection system for personalized advertising. The company said it was confident that it would meet the committee's requirements and \"is committed to providing users with the best possible service.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".. The National Football League (NFL) has a problem on its hands, and his name is Damal Hamlin. Hamlin was a third-year security player from Pittsburgh, winning the sixth round of the draft in 2018 and has since become a goalkeeper for the Pittsburgh Steelers. He also became a lightning rod for critics, both from fans and experts. Since entering the league, Hamlin has often been accused of throwing cheap shots and playing dirty and disruptive acts on the pitch. These criticisms were reinforced this season when Hamlin was suspended for his last four games in a headhelming attack against Colts quarterback Jacob Brissett. The suspension was not Hamlin's first time in the league. He had previously been fined several times for unnecessarily rudeness, and during the playoff season he was even banned from playing as an illegal blow to his opponent. However, the most worrying aspect of Hamlin's behavior on the field is his tendency to rely on physical and intimidation to undermine an opponent's attack. His hits, while legitimate, are often evil, almost always aimed at the opponent's head. This is a worrying pattern of behaviour that the NFL should take seriously. Hamlin's reckless behavior put players at risk of serious injury, and his presence on the field undermined the integrity of the game. On the one hand, it's hard to blame them for wanting to keep a talented player in the league. On the other hand, it's hard to look back on the growing evidence that Hamlin poses a danger to himself and others. The league has taken some steps to punish Hamlin, and his coach promised to take control of him, but it remains to be seen whether the league will act more decisively. The NFL needs to set a strong example when dealing with players like Hamlin. If it wants to maintain the safety and integrity of the game, it must send a message to all players that dangerous behavior will not be tolerated. It's worth mentioning that Hamlin isn't the only player in the league to have a worrying performance on the pitch. Over the past year, star players such as Odell Beckham Jr., Antonio Brown and Vontazel Burfickett have all made their controversial headlines. The NFL needs to make it clear that they will not hesitate to suspend or even ban players who do not comply with its rules. He is a talented player and an important part of Steelers' defense, but he has no place in the league that puts safety above all else. Now it's time for the NFL to show that it won't tolerate players like him.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "For more than 80 years, Pelle has been an indelible symbol of joy, resilience and global brotherhood. He captured the imagination of generations of football fans around the world with a bold and fearless style and great success on the field. As of 2023, Pelle's health had deteriorated significantly due to age, and his family last week announced the inevitable, leaving the world in grief. Today, the Brazilians celebrated the life and legacy of the King of Football with a spectacular coffin parade that drew thousands to San Paolo in Rio de Janeiro, as well as more than one million people watching the march online. A day of mourning began with 21 shots of tribute to Pellet and ended with an exciting mass celebration featuring some of Brazil's most iconic music, dance and performing arts. Pelle's family and closest friends paid tribute to them during a brief but painful vigil in Sambodrome. His son and grandson took his coffin to a stage in the middle of the arena, where souvenirs of Pelle's life and career were decorated. As traditional drums passed through the stadium, fireworks illuminated the night sky, crowds of mourners surrounded Pelle's body and sang for him the classic Brazilian national anthem. After several hours of celebration, Pelle's coffin was placed in a specially crafted earring and on a trip to the city of Rio de Janeiro. Thousands of people lined up to watch and pay tribute as the parade headed for Maracana Stadium, where Pelle scored his 1,000th goal and today still has a plaque with his name and nickname \"O Rei (King)\". In Maracana, the Coffin Parade paused for Bailey's friends, family and fans to gather around his coffin once again. A huge Brazilian flag hung on the stadium symbolizes Pele's great legacy and his profound influence on Brazilian culture. Finally, the march continued and ended up resting in a small village outside of Rio. There, a small ceremony marked the final stop of the journey, where Pelle's body was buried on a special land beneath which were bronze sculptures of three World Cup champions. Throughout the day, villagers used the Brazilian cocktail Capirinhas as a meal to celebrate their country's king of football. When the sun goes down and Brazilians are excited for a day, citizens in Rio and elsewhere look up at the sky to thank Pellet for bringing memories and inspiration to the world. Peret turns football into a game of dreams and pleasures, in the process uniting a nation that changes lives forever. So, this is for you, Pellet. Thank you for your memory and may you rest in peace.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".. Former Pope Joseph Ratzinger died on April 2 at the age of 93, leaving behind a legacy of innovation and reform, but also a controversy over the Catholic Church's response to decades of sexual abuse. Lazinger was appointed Pope in April 2005 after the death of his predecessor, Pope John Paul II. Lachinger is named after Benedict XVI to honor two of his predecessors - Pope Benedict XV and Pope Benedict XIV - who used the name during their tenure. He was the first German pope in centuries and the oldest person to climb the papal steps at the age of 78. During his presidency, Latzinger was responsible for developing and promoting new theological directives to build bridges with other Christian denominations. He was a strong supporter of church teaching on abortion, contraception, and same-sex relationships. He also worked to revitalize the Pope's diplomatic efforts, regularly attending meetings with representatives of other religions, and making high-public visits abroad. In 2001, Ratzinger, as governor of the Diocese of Faith (until he was elected pope), issued a letter claiming that sexual abuse of minors by priests is \"a particularly serious problem.\" He suggested that bishops could avoid costly civil lawsuits by filing such cases in church courts. Critics argued that Ratzinger should do more to promote the Church's position against sexual abuse, and his instructions shifted responsibility to local bishops rather than the Vatican. Razinger often expressed his grief over the pain caused by the crisis, and in 2012 he issued a statement to Catholics around the world expressing \"deep sadness\" at the \"unspeakable crime\" committed by priests. He said: \"I am deeply ashamed that we will do everything possible to prevent this from happening again.\" During his tenure as Pope, Ratzinger sought to reconnect the church with its doctrinal traditions and intellectual foundations. He initiated major reform efforts in such areas as ritualism, universal dialogue, and the relationship between the Church and the modern world, further clarifying the church's teaching on issues such as bioethics and marriage. During his presidency, Ratzinger gave more than 1,000 interviews and wrote several books defending and clarifying Catholic teachings on faith and morality. After Ratzinger's death, people from all over the world paid tribute to him, and many commentators noted that he was a religious and knowledgeable person who had a positive impact on the church and society. Regardless of his Pope's complex legacy, it is still clear that Ratzinger left a lasting impression on the Catholic Church.", "label": "machine"}

As of Friday, the iPhone app no longer shows an option to sign up for Twitter Blue.\n\nThe quick suspension of the service suggests that, at least currently, CEO Elon Musk's big plan to generate new revenue from users isn't working as expected.\n\nThe paid subscription service led to a plethora of pranksters creating imposter accounts on Twitter. It left the platform even more ripe for misinformation, and many cheaply acquired checkmarks were used to impersonate brands, politicians and celebrities with unflattering messages.\n\nOne current sales employee at Twitter said the company decided to pull back on Twitter Blue verification in response to the spate of impersonators.\n\nThe employee, who asked to remain unnamed since they were not authorized to speak on behalf of Twitter, said one account resembling pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly caused a serious problem when it tweeted out, \"we are excited to announce insulin is free now.\"\n\nThe tweet remained on the social media platform for hours before it was taken down. The real Eli Lilly account later tweeted: \"We apologize to those who have been served a misleading message from a fake Lilly account.\"\n\nEli Lilly's stock price dropped sharply after the false message was posted, and so did other pharmaceutical companies including AbbVie, which was also impersonated on Twitter. At that time, major stock indices were positive, amidst a market rally.\n\nAn impersonator also pilloried Tesla , Elon Musk's electric car maker using the paid subscriber blue checkmark. An account with the handle that appeared as \"@TeslaReal\" wrote a flurry of disparaging tweets, one of which said, \"honestly the 53% drop in stock price doesn't phase[sic] us. if there's anyone who knows about Crashing it's us.\"\n\nThe effect of so many changes on the Twitter platform presents a big problem for advertisers, some of which have already paused spending there.\n\nAdditionally, some users who already paid for the service said their recently acquired blue checkmarks have disappeared from their accounts.\n\nA Twitter spokesperson was not immediately available for comment. Musk was not immediately available for comment.\n\nThe rollback of Twitter Blue verified comes at a time when Musk and Alex Spiro, who is acting as Twitters top lawyer now, are working to reassure employees, advertisers and regulators that they will comply with all laws and terms of a prior FTC consent decree.\n\nElon Musk wrote in a companywide email obtained by CNBC on Thursday night, \"I cannot emphasize enough that Twitter will do whatever it takes to adhere to both the letter and spirit of the FTC consent decree. Anything you read to the contrary is absolutely false. The same goes for any other government regulatory matters where Twitter operates.\"\n\nSpiro said in another e-mail that followed that his team had spoken with FTC regulators on Thursday and that Twitter has its \"first upcoming compliance check\" with the agency soon. He emphasized that Twitter itself, not \"individuals who work at Twitter\" would be held liable for any violations.\n\nAs NBC News previously reported, an exodus of Twitter executives since Musk took over has included the departure of the company's head of trust and safety, Yoel Roth, and chief of information security, Lea Kessner among many others involved in infrastructure, trust and safety.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "(CNBC) - VanEck announced that it is closing its three Russian exchange trading funds (ETFs) after an invasion by Russian forces has frozen U.S. investment in the country. The move comes as the United States and its allies have warned of \"consequences\" for Moscow after Russian forces invaded eastern Ukraine. VanEck is shutting down its VanEck Vector Russian ETF, VanEck Vector Russian Small Disc ETF and VanEck Vector Russia hit the ETF, all of which were launched in February this year. The fund, which is designed to track the market performance of Russian companies, has managed assets totalling $120 million as of October 31. The funds are still traded on the U.S. stock exchange, but VanEck said in a statement that it is \"actively working to facilitate an orderly closure of funds\" given the current situation in Ukraine. The U.S. government's sanctions on Russia, which were imposed in response to Russian actions in Ukraine, have hampered investment in Russia, particularly by American companies, and have had a significant impact on the Russian stock market. The U.S. Treasury Department has warned U.S. investors that it may take action against those who trade in Russian assets and that funds invested in Russia could be frozen or blocked. This led to a sharp drop in the price of Russian assets held by VanEck funds, resulting in significant losses for fund managers and investors. To protect investors, VanEck has decided to reduce its funding and is taking the necessary steps to ensure that funds are closed in an orderly manner. In a statement, VanEck said it was \"committed to protecting the interests of our investors and we believe that closing our three ETFs based on current circumstances is the right decision.\" VanEck's funds are not the only ones affected by US sanctions on Russia. Blackstone and iShares have also announced plans to close their Russian ETFs in response to sanctions. The move could have a significant impact on the U.S. investment landscape, as these funds are becoming increasingly popular among investors seeking access to the Russian market. It also shows the power of sanctions in shaping the international financial landscape, and how one country's actions can generate a chain reaction around the world. VanEck's move could also be seen as a sign that the United States and its allies are seriously punishing Russia for its actions in Ukraine. VanEck's shutdown of Russia's ETF is a clear sign that the United States and its allies are willing to use economic measures to force Russia to change its behavior.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Binance CEO Zhao Changpeng said that after a $40 million security breach earlier this year, customer deposits began to return to cryptocurrency exchanges, but the road ahead would be \"foolish\". At the Asian Blockchain Summit in Taipei, Taiwan, Zhao said the company's losses \"cannot be ignored\" and that it had to \"restructure certain teams and business units\" after the attack. The attack occurred in May, when hackers were able to steal 7,000 Bitcoins (BTC) from Binance's hot wallet.At the time, the value of the stolen cryptocurrency was about $40 million, but its price had risen to around $69 million. As a result, Binance has had to take action to protect its customers. \"We have had to take some temporary measures, such as limiting deposits and withdrawals, and conducting additional user verification,\" Zhao said. However, he added that the company has implemented a number of security measures to help protect user funds and prevent similar incidents in the future. \"We strengthened our security, we introduced an enhanced 2FA, and we started doing KYC (Know Your Customer) checks and anti-fraud checks,\" Zhao said. He also said that the company has made progress on its insurance fund, which is designed to protect users' funds in the event of a security breach. \"We have been slowly building our insurance fund and so far it seems to be working very well,\" he said. In general, Zhao said that customer deposits have begun to return, but the road ahead is still \"stupid\". \"We've certainly made progress in recovering customer deposits, which is a bright spot,\" he said, \"but I think the road ahead is still precarious and we need to be very careful about how we spend our resources and how we re-use them.\" Despite the attacks, Binance continued to grow and expand its services.In October, it launched its own crypto-debit cards and a new trading platform for institutional investors. \"We're trying to build a decentralized exchange,\" he said. \"So we're looking for a hybrid approach where the customer side is still concentrated, but the back end is dispersed.\" In addition, Zhao said that the company is seeking to expand beyond cryptocurrencies. \"We are actually looking at some other services for our users, such as splitting, decentralized finance and other services,\" he said. \"We are still very optimistic about the cryptocurrency industry and our role in it,\" he said. \"We've certainly made progress in recovering customer deposits, which so far seems to be working really well.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The nuclear fusion breakthrough heralded on Tuesday was a historic event, culminating decades of research.\n\nAt the same time, fusion power will not be contributing electricity to any power grid for at least a decade, according to most industry watchers. To get there, there will have to be many more technical breakthroughs beyond what was celebrated on Tuesday \u2014 and the money to fund them.\n\nJust after 1 a.m. on Monday, Dec. 5, researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California executed a successful experiment to produce more energy from a nuclear fusion reaction than went into the lasers used to power the reaction.\n\n\"We got out 3.15 megajoules, we put in 2.05 megajoules in the laser,\" said Mark Herrmann, a program director at Lawrence Livermore, on Tuesday. \"That's never been done before in any fusion laboratory anywhere in the world. So it's super exciting.\"\n\nIn a technical panel discussion after the main press announcement on Tuesday, scientists on the team recounted their reactions on learning the news.\n\nTammy Ma, a laser-plasma physicist at the lab, was waiting in an airport when her boss called her. \"I burst into tears. I was jumping up and down in the waiting area, the crazy person.\"\n\nIt took about 300 megajoules of energy from the electricity grid to fire the laser that was used in the experiment, said Herrmann on Tuesday. That's equivalent to what is included in about two-and-a-half gallons of gasoline.\n\nAll of that energy went into the laser fusion reaction that showed net gain of about 1.1 megajoules \u2014 enough energy to boil a teakettle maybe two or three times.\n\n\"This is a science achievement, not a practical one,\" Omar A. Hurricane, a chief scientist at Lawrence Livermore, told CNBC.\n\nBut the amount of energy isn't the point. \"The laser wasn't designed to be efficient. The laser was designed to give us as much juice as possible to make this incredible conditions possible,\" Herrmann said. \"So there are many, many steps that would have to be made in order to get to an inertial fusion as an energy source.\"\n\nThat's partly because National Ignition Facility, where the demonstration took place, is 20 years old, and was constructed using technological components made in the 1980s and 1990s. Laser technology has progressed significantly since then.\n\nThe reason for the celebration was simply that energy was created at all.\n\n\"It's exciting because it proves that fusion can work, and it opens the floodgates to further interest, investment, and innovation toward turning fusion into a power source,\" said Arthur Turrell, a plasma physicist and the author of The Star Builders.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "A federal judge on Tuesday dismissed a case brought by former President Donald Trump that sought to prevent authorities from confiscating records related to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. The case was brought by Trump's lawyers in November, after the Supreme Court rejected a request to prevent prosecutors from accessing the documents. The case is aimed at preventing the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York from searching his private club in Palm Beach. The lawsuit claims that the search for Mar-a-Lago violated the Fourth Amendment protections of the U.S. Constitution against unreasonable searches and seizures. U.S. District Court Judge Royce C. Lamberth ruled in favor of the U.S. Attorney's Office on Tuesday, dismissing the case. The ruling comes after an appeals court panel rejected Trump's request for a special master oversight document to be reviewed. The dispute began in August, when the Supreme Court rejected Trump's request to maintain a lower court order for prosecutors to search Mar-a-Lago. The Supreme Court sent the case back to the District Court, which was asked to decide whether Trump's Fourth Amendment rights had been violated by a search of his property. At the same time, the Appeals Court panel appointed a special supervisor to review any documents seized by the Prosecutor in order to ensure that they did not violate the privileges of any lawyer client. The appeals court said it \"does not believe\" that the U.S. Attorney's Office will properly handle these documents in accordance with the lawyer-client privilege rules. Trump has appealed the decision of the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court, arguing that the appointment of a special master is unconstitutional. But the Supreme Court rejected his argument. The Supreme Court's dismissal of his appeal means that the case is back in local court, and Lambers must decide whether Trump's Fourth Amendment rights have been violated. In Tuesday's ruling, Lambers said the U.S. Attorney's office had not violated Trump's Fourth Amendment rights and therefore the case must be dismissed. \"The Court finds that the U.S. Attorney's Office did not violate Mr Trump's Fourth Amendment rights and that the Court has no authority to review or order action by a grand jury,\" Lambert wrote in the ruling. This ruling means that the U.S. Attorney's Office will be able to continue its investigation without the intervention of a court or special judge. It also means that documents confiscated from Mar-a-Lago can serve as evidence for future prosecution, if any. The dismissal of the case does not end an ongoing investigation by the United States Attorney's Office; it simply means that documents confiscated from Mar-a-Lago can now be used as evidence. The U.S. Attorney's Office is investigating whether Trump and his associates committed any crimes related to the 2020 election, including possible electoral fraud and obstruction of justice. The office has received two guilty pleas from two of Trump's former colleagues - former national security adviser Michael Flynn and his former lawyer Michael Cohen. The outcome of the investigation remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: documents confiscated from Mar-a-Lago will now be part of evidence used to determine whether Trump and his associates committed any crime.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".. According to documents obtained by CNN, elected MP George Santos admitted that he used stolen cheques to withdraw funds from Brazilian banks in 2008. The documents filed with the Federal District Court in Sao Paulo detail how Santos obtained two fraudulent checks to extract large sums of money from Banco ABC Bratislava and Banco BMG. The amount withdrawn was not disclosed. According to the documents, Santos went to a bank in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on July 4, 2008 to deposit checks and withdraw funds. At the time, Santos was working in Sao Paulo for a group of investors who had obtained cheques from unknown sources. The documents also show that Santos was arrested on suspicion of fraud and money laundering, but was eventually cleared of any misconduct. The news of Santos' involvement in the fraud is surprising because he has previously maintained a reputation as an honest politician. Santos, who was elected to Congress last November, has yet to respond to CNN's request for comment. Santos said in a statement that he was \"extremely disappointed\" to learn of the allegations and felt \"destroyed\" by the news. \"I cannot express how much I regret this unfortunate incident and the pain it has caused to my family, friends and voters,\" he said. Santos went on to say that he had learned valuable lessons and thanked his constituents for giving him a second chance. \"I intend to do everything I can to serve my constituents and uphold the highest ethical standards,\" he said. Santos' election comes at a time of intense scrutiny over the use of stolen funds by politicians and other public figures. The news of Santos' involvement in the fraud has led to renewed calls for a full investigation into the use of stolen funds. In a statement, the House Ethics Committee said it was aware of the allegations and \"will take appropriate steps to review the matter and determine whether these allegations warrant further review.\" The committee added that it would \"without hesitation take any necessary steps to ensure that all members of Congress adhere to the highest ethical standards\". The allegations against Santos have sparked widespread anger in Brazil, with many saying the use of stolen funds should not be tolerated. This is not the first time Brazilian politicians have been accused of using stolen funds. In 2016, former Rio de Janeiro governor Sergio Cabral was sentenced to 19 years in prison for corruption and money laundering. Santos' case could come under close scrutiny because Brazilians are eager to see whether politicians can be held accountable for their actions.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's unemployment rate rose to a 16-month high in December, with government data showing that 8.30 percent of the workforce is out of work. Data from the Department of Labor and Employment (MLE) showed that this figure rose from 8.16% in November to its highest level since August 2019, when the unemployment rate was 8.48%. The latest figures come amid a slowdown in the economy, with some industries affected by the coronavirus pandemic leading to job losses. The urban unemployment rate was particularly high, rising from 11.23% last month to 11.47% in December. The rural unemployment rate climbed from 6.58% to 6.65%. MLE data show that the majority of unemployed people are between 20 and 29 years old, most of whom are men. However, the number of unemployed in the 15-19 age group has declined, while the unemployment rate for those aged 50 years and over has also risen. The data also show that people with degrees are more likely to be unemployed than those with lower levels of education. In terms of economic activity, data show that the services sector was most affected by the outbreak. The unemployment rate in the service sector was 13.41% in December compared to 11.81% last month. Unemployment in manufacturing has also risen, with 8.85% of the workforce out of work compared to 7.92% in November. On the other hand, unemployment in the agricultural sector declined, with the unemployment rate falling from 3.03 per cent to 2.67 per cent. Commenting on the data, analysts said that rising unemployment is a sign of the deepening economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak. \"The Indian economy has been hit hard by the outbreak and subsequent blockades. With businesses facing restrictions, many industries such as hotels, tourism and aviation shut down altogether, it's no surprise to see unemployment rise,\" said Sidharth Bhardwaj, an economist at the Institute for Human Resources Management. Bhardwaj added that the services sector is particularly affected by closures and restrictions, as people are advised to stay at home, which affects employment opportunities. He also noted that the unemployment rate may remain high in the near term due to the continuing economic slowdown and the risk of further unemployment. \"There is still some way to go in the recovery, and unemployment is likely to remain high for some time. If we are to return to pre-epidemic employment levels, sustained efforts will be needed to create jobs and revive growth,\" he said. The Government had taken a number of measures to promote job creation, such as the launch of the Employment Creation Programme (EGP) and assistance to small and medium-sized enterprises. However, analysts say the long-term impact of the epidemic on labor markets has not yet been apparent and further steps are needed to ensure sustainable job creation. \"The government must develop a comprehensive plan to revitalize the economy and create jobs,\" said Ajit Prasad, an economist at the Indian School of Management. \"This should include measures to create jobs in manufacturing, construction, IT and finance.\" He added that the government should also focus on creating jobs in rural areas, as the impact of the epidemic is more severe in rural than in urban areas. Overall, the rising unemployment rate indicates that India is facing economic difficulties and further steps are needed to restore growth and create jobs.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "As the global shift towards renewable energy accelerates, clean energy inventories are returning to momentum. The clean energy sector experienced a difficult year in 2020, as demand for pandemic and other disruptions weakened. But inventories have recovered, and the industry's future looks brighter. JPMorgan recently listed its best clean energy options for 2023 in its annual report on the industry. The bank said it sees \"a huge long-term potential\" for the sector and expects it to become an increasingly important part of the global energy mix. Here are the best choices for JPMorgan Chase's 2023 clean energy industry. GE, a leading manufacturer of power generation and energy storage solutions, has focused on expanding its renewable energy portfolio and has invested in several wind and solar projects. GE also has a strong presence in the fast-growing smart grid market, and is investing in digital technologies to help manage the grid more efficiently. Next is Osterde (OSRD), a Danish renewable energy company that has become one of Europe's largest operators of offshore wind farms. The company has grown rapidly in recent years and is now focusing on expanding its presence in other regions, including the United States. SolarEdge (SEDG) is another top choice for JPMorgan Chase.SolarEdge is an Israeli company that designs and manufactures power electronics for residential and commercial solar PV systems.The company's products help reduce the cost of solar installations, making them more convenient and attractive to consumers.SolarEdge also actively participates in the growing market for home energy management systems. JPMorgan also recommended the Portuguese renewable energy company EDP Renewables (EDPR), which owns wind, solar and hydroelectric power plants in Europe, the United States and Latin America, is one of the world's largest wind producers and is focused on expanding its operations in Latin America. Finally, the bank calls Enel (ENL) an Italian utility company with a growing portfolio of clean energy projects around the world. Enel has made significant commitments to renewable energy and plans to reduce its carbon emissions by 80% by 2050. The company is investing in various clean energy projects and hopes to become a major player in the industry. Overall, JPMorgan's top choice for the clean energy sector in 2023 seems to be a solid investment in the future. These companies are well positioned to take advantage of growing trends in renewable energy and transition from traditional sources of energy. As the clean energy industry continues to grow, these companies may benefit from expansion, and should provide investors with attractive long-term opportunities.", "label": "machine"}

Bloomberg reported Tuesday that 70% of economists in a monthly survey said they believed a recession would come in the first half of 2023.\n\nThe consensus may not be right on this one.\n\nAmazon doesn't think a recession is all that likely. Insider reported Thursday the Seattle company's economists saw just a 30% chance of a US recession in the next six months.\n\nThrough its giant e-commerce and cloud businesses, the company has unique insights into consumer and business activity. Here are some of the more surprising findings from Amazon's internal report:\n\nEveryone is worried about inflation. Yet Amazon's economists reckon this won't affect the company as much as other businesses. They expect the price of Amazon products to rise less than 3% next year and then drop in 2024.\n\nIf a recession does occur, Amazon economists don't think the company will endure much pain. The company gets about 60% of its revenue from higher-income consumers who are less affected by higher unemployment and other recessionary outcomes.\n\nLower-income consumers have been joining the company's e-commerce platform in recent years. That has helped Amazon grow, but these customers are more sensitive to an economic slowdown, and inflation chips away at more of their disposable income. So growth maybe a little harder to generate for Amazon in 2023.\n\nMuch of the economic pain in the tech industry is concentrated in unprofitable companies that can't stomach more interest-rate hikes. Amazon is not really in that camp. Neither are Meta, Google, Apple, or Microsoft.\n\nAnd Wall Street eggheads can get so caught up in inflation data that they miss the continued strength of the consumer. That's the engine that drives most of the US economy and a lot of Amazon's success. At this point, the two are closely intertwined, so here's to some relatively good news as we leave a tough 2022 behind and start fresh in January.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson shared a statement with Insider's Eugene Kim for the original story. We've included it in here too, at the company's request:\n\n\"The document in question does not reflect the company's position on the economy and where it's headed. Our CFO Brian Olsavsky shared our thinking on our most recent earnings call, and our CEO shared his thoughts in a Dec. 6 interview at the Dealbook event. This document simply reflects the thoughts of some of our economists.\"", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Russian authorities are looking for an investigative journalist who has revealed the embarrassing facts of their deal, most recently that opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned. London-based Bulgarian journalist Christo Grozev has been working with Dutch investigative team Bellingcat to uncover the truth about what happened after Navalny fell ill on a Siberian flight in August. In response to the news of Grozev's inclusion on the Interpol wanted list, his colleagues and supporters expressed their anger and urged the EU and other countries to take action. In an interview with CNN, Grozef said he was \"shocked\" to learn that he had been put on the wanted list. \"I have not received any official communications from Russian authorities or INTERPOL,\" he said. His name appeared on the list along with other prominent figures from the West, such as former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy. \"This doesn't seem like a place where journalists are on the wanted list,\" Grozef said. He noted that since his move to London, he has been a target of cyber trolls in Russia and elsewhere, had received threats in the past, and \"numerous messages from people who allegedly represent Russian authorities.\" Nina Jankowicz, a researcher at the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute and author of \"Fake Information: Secret Strategies to Destroy the West,\" said Grozev's inclusion on the wanted list was only the latest move by Russia to crack down on independent media. \"This is clearly a matter of deep concern,\" she said. \"Journalism is not a crime, and no journalist should be targeted as such; this is an obvious attempt by the Russian authorities to intimidate and suppress journalists.\" Although Groze lives in the UK, he is a Bulgarian citizen, which means that if he enters Russia, he may be arrested and detained. Gerry Simpson, deputy director of the International Justice Project at Human Rights Watch, said Russian authorities had long sought to stifle independent journalists and activists. \"We are very concerned about this latest development, and we call on the Bulgarian authorities to support press independence, not to yield to pressure from Russia, and to protect Grozev's right to work and travel freely,\" Simpson said. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office also expressed concern about Groese's inclusion on the wanted list, saying it would closely monitor the situation. Grozev, however, was determined to continue his work. \"Journalism is not a crime. Journalists must be allowed to do their jobs without fear of persecution.\" He said he was determined to pursue the truth, despite the dangers. \"The truth will come out one way or another, and I'll do everything I can to make sure it does,\" Grozef said. \"I will not be silent, I will continue to tell stories and investigate, even if I run the risk of being attacked. I just hope that in the process I do not become a martyr.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Jeremy Renner, one of Hollywood's busiest actors, was rushed to a regional hospital on Tuesday night in an avalanche accident. According to reports, Renner was pouring snow at his home in Reno, Nevada when he collided with another car. The actor was taken to the hospital, where he was listed as a \"critical but stable\" condition. There are reports that his injuries do not endanger life and he is expected to make a full recovery. Lenner's public relations officer, Mark Weinberg, issued a statement confirming that the actor had an accident and thanking the first responders for their help. \"We know that Jeremy Renner suffered an accident while skiing at Renault late Tuesday,\" he said. \"At a local hospital, he is in critical but stable condition. We thank the first responders for their swift efforts to provide Mr Reynolds with the help they need and the hospital staff for taking great care of him. His family are grateful for all the love and support they have given them, and ask for privacy at this time.\" The accident occurred hours after Renner, 48, arrived in Reno to start filming a new movie that was originally written by Netflix and titled \"The Last Thing He Wants,\" starring Anne Hathaway, William Duff, and Ben Affleck. The film is expected to be released later this year. Renner has been busy with acting for several years, best known for his roles in the Avengers series, Mission: Impossible series and American Hustle. He recently appeared in the 2019 drama Wind River, and has several upcoming projects, including The Godmother and the action thriller Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard. Renner also recently appeared on Apple TV's \"Carpool Karaoke: Series\", sharing his love for the show \"Frasier\" with David Letterman, and sharing an emotional story about his daughter Ava. The actor has a long history of dealing with tricky stunts, so it's no surprise that he walks through the driveway on snowy nights. He has received phone calls several times in the past, including an overhead crash in Switzerland in 2015 and a slipover accident in France in 2016. We wish Renner a full and speedy recovery, and hope to see him back on the big screen soon.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nThe NFL showdown between the Cincinnati Bengals and Buffalo Bills, which was postponed in the first quarter after Bills safety Damar Hamlin suffered a cardiac arrest and collapsed on the field, was the most-watched \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d telecast in ESPN history, averaging 23.8 million viewers, according to preliminary ratings.\n\nNielsen said Wednesday that the broadcast had an average of 23,788,000 viewers across ABC, ESPN and ESPN2 from approximately 8:30 pm to 10:09 pm. The massive audience makes it the most-watched \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d broadcast since the NFL moved the series to ESPN in 2006, surpassing the previous record of 21.8 million viewers for a Packers-Vikings game in 2009.\n\nMonday\u2019s high-profile game, however, was suspended when Hamlin collapsed in the first quarter just moments after an open field tackle of Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins. Hamlin had his heartbeat restored on the field and is currently in critical condition at a Cincinnati hospital.\n\nDuring game play, ESPN averaged 21.1 million viewers, according to Nielsen ratings. That audience then grew to 23.9 million viewers between 9 p.m. to 10:15 p.m. when ESPN aired news coverage of Hamlin\u2019s collapse.\n\nAn ESPN spokesperson told CNN on Wednesday that, given the special circumstances around Monday\u2019s game, it was not clear whether the viewership numbers would be factored into the season average or used for historical purposes.\n\nFollowing Hamlin\u2019s injury, ESPN quickly cut to a commercial break and continued the broadcast for more than an hour, reporting on Hamlin\u2019s injury as it awaited word from the NFL on if the game would resume.\n\nWhile ESPN has received praise for its calm and measured reporting that avoided speculation on the cause of Hamlin\u2019s horrifying injury, the network notably chose not to interview medical professionals about what millions of viewers had witnessed.\n\nVeteran \u201cSportsCenter\u201d anchor Scott Van Pelt, who anchored the program following the game, told CNN a decision was made to focus strictly on the facts of what had occurred.\n\n\u201cMy personal preference was that I didn\u2019t want to bring in a physician to speculate,\u201d Van Pelt said. \u201cI totally see the other side, where a well-trained eye of a physician might recognize something that might totally make sense. But I just didn\u2019t want to be speculating.\u201d\n\nBefore Hamlin\u2019s devastating injury, the game was expected to be among the most-viewed Monday Night Football games in ESPN\u2019s history. The Bills (12-3) faced off against the Bengals (11-4), the defending AFC champions, with both teams hoping to secure the number one seed in the division.\n\nThe NFL has not yet announced when the teams will continue the postponed game.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "LOS ANGELES, Calif. - The Gabriel union \"feels entitled\" to get out of her first marriage, revealed in a recent episode of 'Red Table Conversations' on Facebook Watch. The actress, who has been married to NBA superstar Dwyane Wade since 2014, opened up with hosts Jada Pinkett Smith and Adrianne Banfield-Jones to discuss the difficulty of being honest in her first marriage. Chris Howard, a 46-year-old union producer who married in 2001. Five years later the marriage ended in divorce, and the alliance admitted on the show that she had been unfaithful to Howard during her love affair. \"This will be my first marriage,\" the union said, \"I still naively think that people who should love you shouldn't hurt you and when they do, you should leave.\" The union went on to discuss why she felt \"right\" to break her vow. \"I feel like I deserve to be happy,\" she explained, \"and I'm like, 'Okay, what should I do? The union admitted that she was a \"selfish\" partner, saying her marriage wasn't her only offense. \"I'm a terrible, horrible partner, and like I said, it's not just cheating. It's a bunch of the least narcissistic and very selfish things that can be tragic,\" she said. While she didn't say who was wrong with her, the league did confirm to Pinkett Smith that it wasn't a long-term affair. \"That's not a relationship, no,\" she said. The union also discussed her use of drugs, particularly cannabis and cocaine, in her teens and early twenties. \"I'm a mess of drugs. I do drugs, I'm at parties, I don't go to work, I steal jobs, I do all sorts of crazy things,\" said the league; \"I'm a wild boy.\" The union said it wasn't until she was in her thirties that she discovered her calling. \"It's almost like the light switch that just turned on,\" said the union, \"and all of a sudden I was like, 'Oh, this is what I should be doing.'\" The union revealed that it was this work that allowed her to direct her creativity and ultimately saved her life. \"For me, finding a place to guide my confusion and all of my energy is the best decision I can make,\" he said. Since then, the league has become one of Hollywood's most visible and successful actors, with a range of honours including her role as an American \"genius\" judge and her role in the film Broken All the Rules.

{"text": "Over the past year, Southwest has received billions of dollars in federal aid to help the airline weather the devastating effects of the pandemic at the mercy of taxpayers. The airline has been praised for rejecting a $4 billion loan from the U.S. Treasury Department's bailout program called the Coronavirus Assistance, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act. But that same week, Southwest received a $3.2 billion cash injection from the Treasury Department to avoid applying for loans. This funding is the largest single aviation assistance program provided through CARES Act, accounting for nearly a quarter of the total federal funds allocated to the aviation industry. These funds are given to airlines to help them maintain solvency and keep workers at work. But a year after getting those funds, Southwest Airlines customers have been wondering: Why is their service getting worse rather than better? \"It's a total mess,\" said one frequent flyer who, like others, asked to remain anonymous for fear that it might alienate airline officials. \"There has been no significant improvement in customer service, delays and cancellations appear to be more frequent, and airlines seem to be doing everything they can to avoid compensating customers for their troubles.\" The airline's current dilemma seems to mark many industries, with American Airlines receiving a total of $64 billion from the CARES Act. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, there were more than 45,000 flight cancellations in November 2020, an increase of nearly 20% over the same period in 2019. Consumer complaints filed with the Department of Transportation also increased significantly, from about 2,500 in October 2019 to 6,500 in October 2020. Southwest's flight cancellation rate was the highest in the entire US aviation industry last summer. In November, it reported 8,123 flight cancellations, a 94% increase from November 2019. The airline has also been criticized for handling customer service issues, with many complaining of waiting too long to talk to a customer service person or not being able to contact them at all. One flier, who declined to be named, said that people who frequently fly were often prioritized and treated more politely. But if passengers are unhappy when they encounter problems at the airport, they can expect to be left in hiding. \"If something goes wrong, like missing a flight, you're likely to be alone,\" the anonymous pilot said. \"Airlines won't do it right, they won't give you alternative flights or compensate for your mistakes.\" But the biggest criticism from customers is that despite receiving billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded assistance, the airline has failed to effectively improve its services. After the Southwest bailout, the Treasury imposed certain conditions on how to use the money. These included a ban on stock repurchases, restrictions on executive pay increases and commitments to retain employees. The airline has met most of these conditions and has exceeded its commitment to employees, expanding the company's equity and raising wages. In fact, the airline's performance has worsened. The proportion of flights arriving on time has dropped significantly in recent months, from 82% in August to 66% in November. In addition, according to passenger accounts, many Southwest Airlines' aircraft are now severely delayed and overcrowded, and the airline is increasingly harassing passengers by charging for seemingly minor inconveniences (such as requiring tickets to be printed or changing reservations). The airline's plight appears to be part of a larger trend across the industry, suggesting that billions of dollars received from taxpayers are either not being properly spent or simply not enough. It's not clear how much taxpayer money the aviation industry needs to get back on its feet and improve service levels, but it clearly requires a lot of money. For now, Southwest Airlines passengers - and the airline industry as a whole - must continue to suffer while waiting for rescue.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "-19 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden said on Saturday that he had expressed concerns to Chinese President Xi Jinping about the way the Chinese government manages the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as issues surrounding Hong Kong's autonomy. In his first call with Xi, Biden said he had \"very clearly\" outlined areas of disagreement. According to a White House statement, the 90-minute call was the first between the two leaders since Biden took office on Jan. 20 and also dealt with climate change and trade issues. Biden then told reporters he was trying to clarify the terms of a \"phase one\" trade deal signed by his predecessor, Donald Trump, and made it clear that if China does not comply with the agreement, the United States will take action against China. \"I have made very clear the areas of our concern, as well as those we believe are not yet resolved in the first phase of the trade agreement, including forced labor and other issues that we think need to be addressed,\" he said. The former vice president also said he \"pointed to him our concerns about how Wuhan's original COVID-19 outbreak was handled, as well as the lack of transparency,\" adding that he had also raised concerns about Hong Kong. \"China's actions have had a negative impact on its position in the world,\" Biden said. Tensions between the world's two largest economies have been rising, including allegations of human rights abuses in China's far western region of Xinjiang, hard claims against Taiwan and Hong Kong's comprehensive national security law. Xi congratulated Biden on taking office and expressed willingness to work together, called for mutual respect, and responded to his long-standing demand that Washington stop interfering in Beijing's perceived internal affairs. \"He also reiterated his support for the one-China policy and continued to advance our relationship,\" the White House said in a statement. According to the statement, the two leaders discussed \"compliance with the rules-based international system and their commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.\" They also talked about the Iran nuclear deal, with Biden vowing to bring the United States back into the 2015 agreement and work with China and other countries to \"address all of Iran's destabilizing activities.\" The White House said the leaders did not directly discuss China's crackdown on Uighur Muslims, but Biden \"clearly expressed his deep concern about human rights violations and restrictions on religious freedom.\" On climate change, the two leaders spoke of \"the urgent need for bold efforts to decarbonize the global economy and the importance of working together to protect the environment and promote a clean energy transition.\" Both sides agreed to maintain communication on these issues and ensure high-level participation. According to the White House, the two leaders did not speak directly about Taiwan during their first call. Washington and Beijing do not have diplomatic relations, and the United States sees the autonomous island as an important part of its regional security strategy. The U.S. move to support Taiwan has infuriated Beijing, calling it a derailed province and sparking military deployments of Chinese warships and aircraft near the island in recent weeks. So far, the Biden administration has been largely moderate on this issue, stressing that Washington's commitment to Taiwan remains solid, while refusing to reveal specific details of policy changes.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": ".. It was a cold Wednesday morning at six o'clock, and husband and wife two chefs John and Lisa had been in the Brooklyn kitchen since early in the morning. After a long day of service the night before, they were again busy preparing for their lunch and dinner in a hurry. Two people working together, like a fine-tuned machine, communicate effectively with practice.Executive chef John is carefully arranging dishes for special dishes for the next day's lunch guests. Meanwhile, Lisa is busy baking vegetables as a vegan recipe and her arms move quickly and precisely. John and Lisa are co-owners and co-executive chefs at one of New York City's most popular restaurants, which have been open for more than a year and quickly gained adoration due to its high-end Italian cuisine. They worked in the restaurant industry for many years before John and Lisa owned their own restaurant.John had been working as a chef for many years, while Lisa used to work as a pastry cook, and she still does this occasionally in the restaurant. After John and Lisa had accumulated enough experience, they decided to open their own restaurant and began creating a unique dining experience. Together with their team of talented chefs and front desk staff, they created a menu and atmosphere that appealed to loyal fans and locals. It is now 9 a.m. and the first deliveries of the day begin to arrive. John and Lisa supervise the arrivals, ensuring that the fresh ingredients that will make up their dishes are in perfect condition. After carefully examining the product and extracting some dishes, they are satisfied and move on to the next task. The morning's rush will soon be full, and the couple begins to prepare for the day's meal. John is carefully cutting out the sausage, while Lisa is soaked in the stove with a fragrant tomato sauce. They work together like an essential oil machine, making amazing dishes in record time. At lunch time, the restaurant was already full and there were guests at every table. As they rushed back and forth between the kitchen and the dining room, John and Lisa took the time to thank their guests and share stories of their beloved hometown of Brooklyn. At 4 p.m., the lunch rush gradually subsided, and the couple took a well-deserved break. Now, with the restaurant running like a clock, they can relax for a few minutes before the dinner heat wave begins and have a cup of coffee together. By 6.30 p.m. the restaurant was full again, and John and Lisa quickly returned to the restaurant's rhythm. They moved elegantly from the kitchen to the restaurant, ensuring that all guests were taken care of and their meals cooked perfectly. At 9 p.m., when the last guest had left, John and Lisa could finally take a break and sit down to enjoy their work. They talked about the successes and struggles of the day, before they knew it was time to clean up the kitchen and go home. It was a long and rewarding day when they left the restaurant feeling energized and proud of their accomplishments. All in all, it was a successful day that they couldn't wait to do again tomorrow.", "label": "machine"}

Their faces appear gaunt, their eyes sullen, after drifting for weeks at sea on a boat with little food or water.\n\n\u201cMy skin was rotting off and my bones were visible,\u201d Nesa said. \u201cI thought I would die on that boat.\u201d\n\nNesa also cries for her 7-year-old daughter, Umme Habiba, who she says she was forced to leave behind in Bangladesh \u2013 she couldn\u2019t afford any more than the $1,000 the traffickers demanded to transport her and her youngest child to Malaysia. \u201cMy heart is burning for my daughter,\u201d she said.\n\nNesa and Umme Salima were among around 200 Rohingya, members of a persecuted Muslim minority, who embarked on the dangerous voyage in late November from Cox\u2019s Bazar, a sprawling refugee camp in Bangladesh crowded with around a million people who fled alleged genocide by the Myanmar military.\n\nBut soon after they left, the engine cut out, turning what was supposed to be a 7-day journey into a month-long ordeal at sea, exposed to the elements in the open-topped wooden boat, surviving only on rainwater and just three days\u2019 worth of food.\n\nNesa said she saw starving men jump overboard in a desperate search for food, but they never returned. And she witnessed a baby die after being fed salt water from the sea.\n\nAs the weeks wore on, the passengers\u2019 families and aid agencies pleaded with governments in multiple countries to help them \u2013 but their cries were ignored.\n\nThen on December 26, the boat was rescued by Indonesian fishermen and local authorities in Aceh, according to the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR). Of the 200 or so people who boarded the boat, only 174 survived \u2013 around 26 died on the boat, or are missing at sea, presumed dead.\n\nBabar Baloch, an Asia spokesperson for the agency, said after a lull during Covid, the numbers of people fleeing are back to pre-Covid levels. Some 2,500 boarded unseaworthy boats last year for the journey, and as many as 400 of them died, making 2022 one of the deadliest years in a decade for Rohingya escaping Cox\u2019s Bazar.\n\n\u201cThese are literally death traps that once you get in \u2026 you end up losing your life,\u201d he said.\n\nUmme Habiba remains in Cox's Bazar, where she is unable to go to school. Courtesy Mohammed Rezuwan Khan\n\n\u2018We are starving. We are dying here\u2019\n\nNesa and Salima\u2019s journey began on November 25 from the overcrowded refugee camps in Cox\u2019s Bazar, where she said her children couldn\u2019t go to school, leaving her with little hope for their future.\n\nNesa said she had carried around two kilograms of rice for the journey, but shortly after the boat left the port, its engine died and they started drifting.\n\n\u201cStarving with no food, we saw a fishing boat nearby and tried to go close,\u201d she said, crying as she recalled the horror. \u201cWe jumped in the water to swim close to that boat but in the end, we could not.\u201d\n\nThe rickety wooden boat that carried Hatemon Nesa and her daughter, Umme Salima pictured in Aceh province, Indonesia. CNN\n\nDuring December, as the boat bobbed aimlessly in the Bay of Bengal, the UNHCR said it was spotted near India and Sri Lanka. But the agency said those countries \u201ccontinuously ignored\u201d its pleas for intervention.\n\nCNN has contacted the Indian and Sri Lankan Navies for comment but has not received a response. Last month, the Sri Lankan Navy said in a statement that its crews had made a \u201cstrenuous effort\u201d to rescue another boat carrying 104 Rohingya, including many women and children, who had fled Bangladesh.\n\nOn December 18, Nesa\u2019s brother, Mohammed Rezuwan Khan, who is in Cox\u2019s Bazar, shared with CNN an audio clip of a harrowing phone call he received from one of the refugees aboard Nesa\u2019s boat.\n\n\u201cWe are dying here,\u201d the man said via satellite phone, according to the recording. \u201cWe haven\u2019t eaten anything for eight to 10 days. We are starving.\u201d\n\nHatemon Nesa and her 5-year-old daughter Umme Salima at a shelter in Aceh province in Indonesia. CNN\n\nNesa said the boat\u2019s driver and another crew member jumped into the ocean to find food, but they never returned. \u201cI think they got eaten by fish in the sea,\u201d she said.\n\nTwelve other men entered the water, while holding onto a long rope attached to the boat to try to catch something to eat, but as others on the boat tried to pull them back in, the rope snapped, Nesa said. \u201cThey could not return to the boat.\u201d\n\nWhile all countries are bound by international law to rescue people in distress at sea, swift action is not always forthcoming \u2013 particularly where Rohingya refugees are concerned, according to Baloch, from the UNHCR.\n\n\u201cI think everyone will agree as human beings that we have the responsibility you want to save one life in distress, let alone hundreds of people dying,\u201d Baloch said. \u201c(Nearby states) have to act to save these desperate people. It has to be an action which is in coordination done collectively by all the states in the region.\u201d\n\nAn uncertain future\n\nNesa and Umme Salima were among the 174 emaciated survivors shown on video setting foot on land for the first time in weeks in late December, some immediately collapsing onto the sand of an Aceh beach, too weak to stand.\n\nThey are among the more fortunate ones \u2013 the UNHCR believes another 180 are presumed dead, lost at sea on another boat since early December, when the occupants stopped communicating with their families.\n\nThe survivors from Nesa\u2019s boat are now receiving medical care in Aceh, however it remains unclear what might happen to them in the coming weeks and months.\n\nRohingya refugees rest after being transferred to a temporary shelter following their arrival by a boat in Laweung, Aceh province on December 27, 2022. Chaideer Mahyuddin/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIndonesia is not party to the UN Refugee Convention and lacks a national refugee protection structure, according to the UNHCR.\n\nFor those found to be refugees, UNHCR will begin to look for one of a range of what solutions, including resettlement to a third country or voluntary repatriation, if a person is able to \u201creturn in safety and dignity.\u201d\n\nThis marks the start of a new chapter for the group of passengers, who have lived for years in overcrowded, unhygienic and unsafe refugee camps in Bangladesh, after fleeing decades of systematic discrimination, widespread brutality and sexual violence in their home country of Myanmar.\n\n\u201cStateless, persecuted, these Rohingya refugees have known little peace,\u201d said UNHCR\u2019s Baloch.\n\nMuch more needs to be done by the international community for the persecuted group, who suffer on a scale most cannot imagine, he added.\n\nFor Nesa, the hope remains that she might be reunited with her other daughter some day.\n\n\u201cI was about to die (in Bangladesh),\u201d she said. \u201cAllah gave me a new life \u2026 My children should get a proper education.

{"text": "'Nothing outside our walls matters' \u2014 TCU pulled off an all-time CFP stunner and is still hungry for more\n\nThey started the season with a new head coach and no ranking.\n\nThen they started winning games, sometimes on last-minute touchdowns or last-second, fire-drill kicks.\n\nThe more everyone expected them to lose, they found ways to win \u2014 8-0, 10-0, 12-0 \u2014 until the TCU Horned Frogs, little, old TCU was in the College Football Playoff. A once-afterthought program was representing a league, the Big 12, that was supposedly left for dead about 17 months ago.\n\nEven then, few believed. All week the Horned Frogs were told they were going to get run over by a behemoth of a Michigan offensive line. All week they were told they should be happy to be there, a plucky, underdog program fortunate to even get a chance to be on this stage.\n\nAll week they were told it was going to end.\n\nThen it didn\u2019t end.\n\n\u201cNothing outside of our walls matters,\u201d said Dee Winters, TCU linebacker extraordinaire.\n\nTCU 51, Michigan 45.\n\nMaybe this is what it took, maybe this is the kind of team that could survive such a wild shootout, a game that the Horned Frogs seemingly put away three or four times only to have the Wolverines climb up off the canvas and renew the fight.\n\nMaybe this is what was needed for the College Football Playoff, now in its ninth season and headed toward expansion, to produce the closest thing to a Cinderella as this cruelly top-heavy sport has known in a long, long time.\n\nTCU quarterback Max Duggan (15) has played a starring role in his team's magical season, and he made some key plays in TCU's thrilling 51-45 win over Michigan in Saturday's College Football Playoff semifinal. (Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nIt took everything. It took everyone.\n\nIt took cornerback Bud Clark intercepting Michigan\u2019s J.J. McCarthy in the first quarter and running it the other way for a touchdown. It took Winters doing the same in the third. It took two goal-line stands \u2014 one a snuffing out of a Philly Special, the other a fumble recovery after a controversial replay reversal.\n\nIt took four sacks by Dylan Horton and 13 tackles for a loss by the team (plus an intentional grounding penalty). It took three pass deflections by Tre\u2019Vius Hodges-Tomlinson and 150 yards rushing from Emari Demercado. It took two more rushing scores by quarterback Max Duggan, including a lower-the-shoulder barrel-in that set the physical tone as much as any teeth-rattling hit by the defense.\n\nStory continues\n\nTough? Physically and mentally TCU is tougher than maybe anyone can describe. The Horned Frogs have won 13 games this season and in many of them the other team was left wondering how in the world it lost. You can add Michigan to that list \u2014 although two pick-sixes is a well-worn strategy for defeat.\n\n\u201cI think all week we heard about Big Ten football and how they were going to line up and run over us,\u201d head coach Sonny Dykes said. \u201cWe did a great job stopping the run and forcing them to do some things they are less comfortable doing.\u201d\n\nDonovan Edwards broke a long one early, but otherwise averaged 2.95 yards per carry. That meant Michigan needed McCarthy to throw it 34 times, nearly 12 more than his per-game average. He completed just 20, not counting those two crushing interceptions.\n\nWhen the TCU offense seemed too slow late in the game, there was a brilliant 76-yard catch and run by Quentin Johnston. And when the defense appeared to tire, there was a final stuffing of Michigan in the last seconds.\n\nThere was plenty of controversy as well, and the inexcusable reversal of a Michigan touchdown will rankle those in Ann Arbor forever. But it was TCU who recovered a goal-line fumble on the next play. Besides, the Horned Frogs didn\u2019t make the calls, and plenty of bad ones went against them, too.\n\nTCU just rolled with it. The ups and downs, comebacks and momentum shifts.\n\n\u201cI think our guys did a great job staying neutral, not getting too high or too low,\u201d said Duggan, who went just 14-of-29 for 225 yards and threw two interceptions, yet never looked rattled.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s tough,\u201d Dykes said. \u201cNothing bothers him. He\u2019s just got that confidence and belief in himself.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s this team. No one believed in TCU this season because there was no reason to believe in TCU this season. It went 5-7 last season and saw legendary head coach Gary Patterson, the architect who brought the Frogs from mid-major football to the Big 12, fired. They hadn\u2019t won 10 games since 2017.\n\nMax Duggan is congratulated by offensive tackle Brandon Coleman (77) after scoring one of his two rushing TDs against Michigan in the Fiesta Bowl. Duggan threw for two more scores on Saturday. (Kirby Lee/USA TODAY Sports)\n\nIn came Dykes from SMU and even the most die-hard fan might have hoped for an 8-4 season that showed potential for the future.\n\nInstead, everything changed, everything grew.\n\n\u201cJust go 1-0 every single week and eventually we will be there,\u201d Winters said.\n\nEvery coach tries to preach that. This time it worked. Like a purple snowball, it just grew with each rotation, each victory. Not just the win total, but the amount of faith that it would continue. Maybe everyone else thought Michigan would maul them off the field, but the Frogs sure didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cWe want to be the tougher team,\u201d Duggan said. \u201cThat is what we take our pride to be.\u201d\n\nOne play at a time. One hit at a time. One sustained counterpunch at a time. TCU will assuredly be monster underdogs in the title game in Los Angeles on Jan. 9, expected to lose, expected to fail, expected to just be a bit part in someone else\u2019s stories.\n\nThat\u2019s fine. That\u2019s where TCU is most comfortable. Overlooked and unloved. Count the Frogs out at your own peril, because they are still standing and still standing their ground.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "After months and months of SARS-CoV-2 subvariant soup, one ingredient has emerged in the United States with a flavor pungent enough to overwhelm the rest: XBB.1.5, an Omicron offshoot that now accounts for an estimated 75 percent of cases in the Northeast. A crafty dodger of antibodies that is able to grip extra tightly onto the surface of our cells, XBB.1.5 is now officially the country\u2019s fastest-spreading coronavirus subvariant. In the last week of December alone, it zoomed from 20 percent of estimated infections nationwide to 40 percent; soon, it\u2019s expected to be all that\u2019s left, or at least very close. \u201cThat\u2019s the big thing everybody looks for\u2014how quickly it takes over from existing variants,\u201d says Shaun Truelove, an infectious-disease modeler at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a really quick rise.\u201d\n\nAll of this raises familiar worries: more illness, more long COVID, more hospitalizations, more health-care system strain. With holiday cheer and chilly temperatures crowding people indoors, and the uptake of bivalent vaccines at an abysmal low, a winter wave was already brewing in the U.S. The impending dominance of an especially speedy, immune-evasive variant, Truelove told me, could ratchet up that swell.\n\nBut the American public has heard that warning many, many, many times before\u2014and by and large, the situation has not changed. The world has come a long way since early 2020, when it lacked vaccines and drugs to combat the coronavirus; now, with immunity from shots and past infections slathered across the planet\u2014porous and uneven though that layer may be\u2014the population is no longer nearly so vulnerable to COVID\u2019s worst effects. Nor is XBB.1.5 a doomsday-caliber threat. So far, no evidence suggests that the subvariant is inherently more severe than its predecessors. When its close sibling, XBB, swamped Singapore a few months ago, pushing case counts up, hospitalizations didn\u2019t undergo a disproportionately massive spike (though XBB.1.5 is more transmissible, and the U.S. is less well vaccinated). Compared with the original Omicron surge that pummeled the nation this time last year, \u201cI think there\u2019s less to be worried about,\u201d especially for people who are up to date on their vaccines, says Mehul Suthar, a viral immunologist at Emory University who\u2019s been studying how the immune system reacts to new variants. \u201cMy previous exposures are probably going to help against any XBB infection I have.\u201d\n\nSARS-CoV-2\u2019s evolution is still worth tracking closely through genomic surveillance\u2014which is only getting harder as testing efforts continue to be pared back. But \u201cvariants mean something a little different now for most of the world than they did earlier in the pandemic,\u201d says Emma Hodcroft, a molecular epidemiologist at the University of Bern, in Switzerland, who\u2019s been tracking the proportions of SARS-Cov-2 variants around the world. Versions of the virus that can elude a subset of our immune defenses are, after all, going to keep on coming, for as long as SARS-CoV-2 is with us\u2014likely forever, as my colleague Sarah Zhang has written. It\u2019s the classic host-pathogen arms race: Viruses infect us; our bodies, hoping to avoid a similarly severe reinfection, build up defenses, goading the invader into modifying its features so it can infiltrate us anew.\n\nRead: How long can the coronavirus keep infecting us?\n\nBut the virus is not evolving toward the point where it\u2019s unstoppable; it\u2019s only switching up its fencing stance to sidestep our latest parries as we do the same for it. A version of the virus that succeeds in one place may flop in another, depending on the context: local vaccination and infection histories, for instance, or how many elderly and immunocompromised individuals are around, and the degree to which everyone avoids trading public air. With the world\u2019s immune landscape now so uneven, \u201cit\u2019s getting harder for the virus to do that synchronized wave that Omicron did this time last year,\u201d says Verity Hill, an evolutionary virologist at Yale. It will keep trying to creep around our defenses, says Pavitra Roychoudhury, who\u2019s monitoring SARS-CoV-2 variants at the University of Washington, but \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to have alarm-bell emojis for every variant that comes out.\u201d\n\nRead: The coronavirus\u2019s next move\n\nSome particularly worrying variants and subvariants will continue to arise, with telltale signs, Roychoudhury told me: a steep increase in wastewater surveillance, followed by a catastrophic climb in hospitalizations; a superfast takeover that kicks other coronavirus strains off the stage in a matter of days or weeks. Omens such as these hint at a variant that\u2019s probably so good at circumventing existing immune defenses that it will easily sicken just about everyone again\u2014and cause enough illness overall that a large number of cases turn severe. Also possible is a future variant that is inherently more virulent, adding risk to every new case. In extreme versions of these scenarios, tests, treatments, and masks might need to come back into mass use; researchers may need to concoct a new vaccine recipe at an accelerated pace. But that\u2019s a threshold that most variations of SARS-CoV-2 will not clear\u2014including, it seems so far, XBB.1.5. Right now, Hodcroft told me, \u201cit\u2019s hard to imagine that anything we\u2019ve been seeing in the last few months would really cause a rush to do a vaccine update,\u201d or anything else similarly extreme. \u201cWe don\u2019t make a new flu vaccine every time we see a new variant, and we see those all through the year.\u201d Our current crop of BA.5-focused shots is not a great match for XBB.1.5, as Suthar and his colleagues have found, at least on the antibody front. But antibodies aren't the only defenses at play\u2014and Suthar told me it\u2019s still far better to have the new vaccine than not.\n\nIn the U.S., wastewater counts and hospitalizations are ticking upward, and XBB.1.5 is quickly elbowing out its peers. But the estimated infection rise doesn\u2019t seem nearly as steep as the ascension of the original Omicron variant, BA.1 (though our tracking is now poorer). XBB.1.5 also isn\u2019t dominating equally in different parts of the country\u2014and Truelove points out that it doesn\u2019t yet seem tightly linked to hospitalizations in the places where it\u2019s gained traction so far. As tempting as it may be to blame any rise in cases and hospitalizations on the latest subvariant, our own behaviors are at least as important. Drop-offs in vaccine uptake or big jumps in mitigation-free mingling can drive spikes in illness on their own. \u201cWe were expecting a wave already, this time of year,\u201d Hill told me. Travel is up, masking is down. And just 15 percent of Americans over the age of 5 have received a bivalent shot.\n\nThe pace at which new SARS-CoV-2 variants and subvariants take over could eventually slow, but the experts I spoke with weren\u2019t sure this would happen. Immunity across the globe remains patchy; only a subset of countries have access to updated bivalent vaccines, while some countries are still struggling to get first doses into millions of arms. And with nearly all COVID-dampening mitigations \u201cpretty much gone\u201d on a global scale, Hodcroft told me, it\u2019s gotten awfully easy for the coronavirus to keep experimenting with new ways to stump our immune defenses. XBB.1.5 is both the product and the catalyst of unfettered spread\u2014and should that continue, the virus will take advantage again.", "label": "human"}

They decided to sell only non-perishable items that had a proven demand, and didn't want to spend money on decorations, advertising, or inventory that wasn't selling. What was surprising to shoppers at the time was the self-service nature of the store, introduced in the mid-1950s; customers were able to take products off the shelves themselves, in stark contrast to other retailers, where goods were generally kept behind the counter.\n\n\"We wanted our stores to be like other retail outlets, offering a wide range of groceries,\" Karl said in 1953, as quoted in \"Bare Essentials: The Aldi Success Story.\"\n\n\"But then we did not follow up on this after all, because we recognised that with our narrow range of products we could also run a successful business and that, compared with other businesses, our expenses remained very low and this was largely due to our narrow range of products.

The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite climbed to all-time highs amid vaccine distributions and increased economic activity.\n\nThe stock market\u2019s recent run comes on the heels of the longest bull market in history, which spanned 2009 to 2020. Since 2009, the S&P 500 has only posted one losing year for total returns (2018). In fact, the index has posted total annual returns of more than 15% in seven of those 12 years. The index, which tracks the performance of 500 large public companies, was up more than 25% in 2021.\n\nBut the T. Rowe Price report, which was issued in the fall of 2021, warned of less robust returns.\n\n\u201cWe believe midterm returns will be lower than those seen in previous periods \u2013 in some cases considerably lower. This has significant ramifications for retirement plans and whom they benefit,\u201d the firm stated in its report.\n\nThe financial services firm first pointed to fixed-income markets and the near-historic low interest rates \u2013 now being raised by the Federal Reserve. That\u2019s a trend the firm expected to continue. As for the equity markets, \u201cWe expect returns in many large markets such as the U.S. to be restrained relative to recent history,\u201d it added. \u201cWhile valuations across asset classes vary, and some assets are attractively valued, the valuations of most assets are elevated on these measures.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nLastly, T. Rowe Price pointed to several risks that markets face, including inflation \u2013 which was at a 40-year high in June 2022. While fiscal stimulus, earnings growth and economic activity have all helped propel the pandemic recovery, inflationary fears were evident in late 2021. In October 2021, for example, the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers rose 6.2% compared to 12 months earlier, the largest increase since 1990.\n\nThe risks extend beyond U.S. markets. The T. Rowe Price report noted that China is facing supply chain disruptions and rising commodities prices. Elsewhere, virus mutations and vaccine rollout challenges may also hamper investment returns.\n\n\u201cWhile the global economy has been buoyed by a period of extreme liquidity driven by fiscal and monetary stimulus, these tailwinds are likely to fade as central banks begin to pursue more moderate policies,\u201d the report stated. \u201cAlthough these conditions may not materialize as significant headwinds for growth, we believe they contribute to a less compelling risk/reward profile going forward. Retirement investors will need to be positioned accordingly.\u201d\n\nHow Retirement Savers Can Respond\n\nImage shows a couple looking over their retirement investments. T. Rowe Price says investors should expect returns in the coming period that will be lower than recent years.\n\nInvestors who are saving for retirement have three options for meeting the challenge of lower-than-expected future returns:\n\nSave more or delay retirement: T. Rowe Price acknowledges this may be the \u201cleast attractive\u201d option, however saving more or simply delaying retirement can help offset lower returns. By delaying retirement, a person can reduce the number of years for which they\u2019ll need retirement income. Postponing retirement and working longer can also enable a person to claim Social Security later. Delaying Social Security beyond full retirement age will result in a larger benefit.\n\nAcquire more growth-seeking assets: The second option may mean increasing a portfolio\u2019s equity composition or introducing fixed-income securities that offer higher returns. This can lead to more risk, but a target date fund with a growth-oriented glide path may be a good option for doing so, especially for investors whose retirements are still years away, T. Rowe Price said.\n\nLimit spending in retirement: The third and final option is to limit spending in retirement. \u201cT. Rowe Price analysis of retirees\u2019 spending habits reveals that retirees tend to adjust their spending to their income,\u201d the report states. \u201cMost of the retirees who do adjust their spending have the means and flexibility to do so. The poorest households, however, cannot spend less.\u201d\n\nBottom Line\n\nAs the U.S. and other nations continue to wade through high inflation and a slowing economy, T. Rowe Price warns that investors should expect lower returns. To limit the impact of lower investment returns, those planning for retirement can simply save more or delay retirement. They can also add more growth-seeking assets to their portfolios, or adjust their spending habits in retirement.\n\nRetirement Planning Tips\n\nDo you know how much you\u2019ll need to have saved for retirement?

She met with an employee, called Mr N, who had gone to school with the company's president \u2013 who was also the chairman's son.\n\nMs K reportedly agreed to donate part of her liver in exchange for 100 million won ($77,000) and a job for her son, per The Hankyoreh.\n\nThe outlet reported that Ms K entered hospital on March 7 to have tests before making the donation, and was added to the organ donor register a week later.\n\nShe later entered hospital for the surgery, but tested positive for COVID-19, delaying the procedure.

During an interview with Jim Cramer on \"Mad Money\" Thursday evening, Jim pushed Newlands on whether Constellation would consider a buyback given the decline in the stock. \"Big cash flow, lots of opportunity to do many things with that cash at $208, perhaps the best thing to do with that cash is to buy stock,\" Jim prodded. For his part, Newlands responded, \"We already have additional approval from our board to buy back stock. And I think at this price point, it would be silly not to do just that.\" Still, Newlands called Thursday's market moves a \"total overreaction.\" While the Club was disappointed by Constellation's lackluster earnings and full-year-guidance downgrade, we see the stock's slide as a buying opportunity .

{"text": ".. As the job market continues to change, businesses are beginning to adapt to changing environments. Unfortunately, this is not necessarily good news for job seekers. In the past few years, companies have begun to place more emphasis on pay transparency in hiring positions. While this helps job seekers better understand what they can get if hired, it has had some of the opposite effect: Companies actually offer lower wages than before. According to a recent study by research firm PayScale, the median wage offered in the public job market has declined since 2018. PayScale analyzed more than one million job openings from more than 18,000 companies in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom and found that the average salary range for professional positions dropped from $68,000 to $64,000 during this period. Some employers may want to be more competitive in the job market, and may be cautious about disclosing the true range of wages they can offer. By offering lower job vacancy rates, they can keep a certain amount of salary quotes for employees hidden before they actually start working. At the same time, employers may also want to use pay transparency to reduce their overall wage costs. If a company can get someone to accept a lower salary than normal, it will save money. As a result, when job seekers are hired, they assume that the maximum salary to be offered by the company has been negotiated. But the reality is that companies can and do lower their pay ranges in job announcements for many reasons. In order to ensure that the job you are applying for is paid as much as possible, it's important to understand the market and conduct research. Read information about the job and industry, and figure out what a reasonable salary for the job should be. During interviews and negotiations, make sure to emphasize your experience and knowledge of this area. It is also important to remember that pay transparency is relatively new. As more companies begin to embrace it, the salary range outlined in hiring information may become more accurate, and job seekers will have a better idea of what jobs they can actually expect.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Russia's Daniel Medvedev defeated Serbia's Miomir Kekmanovich 6-4, 6-4 in order to reach the Adelaide International Quarter Final on Saturday. World No. 3 passed in an hour and 44 minutes, and resisted the late spike of world No. 79 after leading 6-4, 4-1. In a game played in Australia's hot sun, when the temperature spiked, both players had to undergo heat exhaustion treatment. Medvedev, who started his season in Australia and lost the third round of the Melbourne Open, is happy with his progress. \"I'm really happy, I feel very confident and play well,\" he said. The Russian team started off well, breaking Kekmanovich's serve early in the first set to lead 3-1 and staying ahead, relying on a strong starter to lead 6-4. Kekmanovich began to find his foot in the second set, pushing Medvedev all the way, but the Russians managed to beat his opponent in the sixth game and then insisted on winning. The third seed faces a tough challenge in the next round against England's Kyle Edmund. Edmund, ranked 34th in the world, was better than Medvedev last year in the U.S. Open semifinals and won at his final meeting in Rotterdam in February. Medvedev is one of the main contenders for the title, which can win two victories in Australia this year and a victory in Adelaide. He has reached the quarter-finals of the Australian Open and this year's Brisbane international semi-final. \"It's not a simple draw, but I really have confidence that I can make it go further,\" he said. The former Wimbledon finalists will now have their eyes firmly fixed on the competition for the title. If he manages to make it to the final, he may face top seed Dominic Thiem, who fought against Medvedev later in the game. The two had only met twice before, and Medvedev held two meetings in Cincinnati and Paris. However, the Australian Open semifinals may still have to overcome a powerful challenge from the second son - Canada's Denis Shapovalov. The two were drawn into an epic fifth in Melbourne last year, and then Medvedev locked his place in the final. When Adelaide International resumes on Sunday, both players will seek a place in the final four games.", "label": "machine"}

Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor was born in Bruton Street, Mayfair, London on 21 April 1926. She married Prince Philip in 1947 and ascended the throne of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth on 6 February 1952 after the death of her Father, King George VI. Queen Elizabeth II died at Balmoral Castle in Scotland on September 8, 2022, and is succeeded by her eldest son, King Charles III. Jeff Spicer/Pool via REUTERS\n\nSummary Altercation in UK prince's upcoming book- Guardian\n\nHarry won't commit to attending father's coronation\n\nRoyal brothers have fallen out in recent years\n\nHarry's book \"Spare\" to be published next week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Britain's Prince Harry says in his much-awaited memoir that older brother and heir to the throne Prince William knocked him to the floor during a 2019 argument over Harry's American wife Meghan, the Guardian newspaper reported on Wednesday.\n\nThe altercation between the brothers, the sons of King Charles, is detailed in Harry's book \"Spare\" which is due to be published on Jan. 10, said the Guardian, stating it had obtained a leaked copy despite stringent security.\n\nThe report came as ITV released a clip of an upcoming interview with Harry ahead of the book's publication in which he said he could not commit to attending his father's coronation in May.\n\nAccording to the Guardian's account, the 2019 sibling brawl took place at Harry's London home arose after William called Meghan \"difficult\", \"rude\" and \"abrasive\", which Harry said sounded like \"the press narrative\" about his wife.\n\n\"He grabbed me by the collar, ripping my necklace, and he knocked me to the floor,\" Harry wrote, according to the paper.\n\n\"I landed on the dog's bowl, which cracked under my back, the pieces cutting into me. I lay there for a moment, dazed, then got to my feet and told him to get out.\"\n\nWilliam then challenged his younger brother to hit back but Harry refused. William later returned to the scene, \"looking regretful, and apologised\", Harry wrote, according to the extract, with his brother asking him not to tell Meghan that he had \"attacked\" him.\n\nSpokespeople for King Charles and Prince William declined to comment on the Guardian report.\n\nWilliam and Harry were once seen as very close after the death of their mother, Princess Diana, in a Paris car crash in 1997. But the brothers have fallen out since Harry married Meghan, a former actress, in 2018 and the couple then stepped down for royal duties to move to California two years later.\n\nSince their departure, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, as the couple are officially known, have delivered stinging criticism of the Windsors and the British monarchy which has included accusations of racism which William himself has dismissed.\n\nLast month, their six-part Netflix documentary, which attracted record audiences, aired with renewed accusations including that William had screamed at Harry during a crisis summit to discuss his future.\n\nThe main criticism from Harry and Meghan is that royal aides not only refused to hit back at hostile, inaccurate press coverage but were complicit in leaking negative stories to protect other royals, most notably William.\n\n\"I don't know how staying silent is ever going to make things better,\" Harry said in Thursday's ITV clip.\n\nAsked why he was invading the privacy of his family, something he had railed against, he replied: \"That will be the accusation from the people that don't understand or don't want to believe that my family have been briefing the press.\"\n\nHEIR AND A SPARE\n\nThe title of his book \"Spare\" comes from an oft-cited quote in British aristocratic circles about the need for an heir, and a spare. According to the Guardian extracts, King Charles reputedly said on the day Harry was born to Diana: \"Wonderful! Now you've given me an heir and a spare \u2013 my work is done.\"\n\nThe book also recounts \"intensely private scenes and conversations\", the Guardian reported, such as describing his memories and love of his mother, who was killed in a 1997 car crash, and grandmother Queen Elizabeth, who died last year at age 96.\n\nHarry has given two broadcast interviews ahead of the book's publication which are due to be shown on Sunday, with clips indicating he would return to complaints that Buckingham Palace had failed to protect him and his wife.\n\n\"They feel as though it's better to keep us, somehow, as the villains,\" Harry said in a trailer released by ITV.\n\nHow much the disclosures will resonate with the public is unclear. A YouGov poll this week found 65% of those surveyed were \"not interested at all\" in his upcoming book, while another found greater sympathy among respondents for William and his wife Kate than for Harry and Meghan.\n\nCharles himself is still hoping for a reconciliation with his son, unnamed sources told newspapers this week.\n\nIn its leaked extracts, the Guardian says the king had stood between his two sons during a difficult meeting at Windsor Castle following the April 2021 funeral for their grandfather Prince Philip, the late queen's husband.\n\n\"Please, boys,\" Harry quoted his father as saying. \"Don\u2019t make my final years a misery.\"\n\nEditing by Angus MacSwan and Nick Macfie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The Federal Trade Commission is looking closely at Microsoft's acquisition of game giant Activision Blizzard, suggesting that U.S. regulators may take action to block the $7.5 billion deal. The announcement comes as Microsoft is reportedly close to acquiring the world's largest game publisher, Activision Blizzard, which is also the parent company of some of the most popular games, including Watchtower, Call of Duty and Diablo. If approved, the deal would be the biggest video game publisher acquisition in the industry's history, surpassing Tencent's $3.8 billion purchase of Riot Games in 2011. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) began reviewing Microsoft's deal with Activision Blizzard this summer, shortly after the proposal was announced. In a statement, the FTC said its review \"is aimed at determining whether transactions are likely to significantly reduce competition or anti-competitive in any one or more markets.\" Industry observers say the FTC may conclude that Microsoft is using its market power and financial resources to acquire major rivals in the gaming space, thereby reducing competition and raising consumer prices. As of Monday, Microsoft was a giant in both the gaming industry and the broader tech sector, with a market value of nearly $2 trillion. Experts also warn that the merger of Microsoft and Activision Blizzard may also be bad news for smaller independent game developers. The combination of the two main players could create a more integrated environment in which larger game publishers can strengthen small developers by threatening to pull their games off the shelves. In response to CNN's questions, Microsoft said the deal was \"pre-consumer\" and would bring more choice, value and innovation to the gaming industry. But other tech giants have seen the FTC take action against them to make acquisitions. For example, in 2011, the FTC blocked Google's purchase of travel information company ITA software, saying that the deal would allow Google to monopolize the market for air flight search services. The FTC is expected to make a decision on the merger of Microsoft and Activision Blizzard in the coming months. If approved, it would be a major victory for Microsoft and Action Blizzard, which has struggled with slow growth. In 2016, the tech giant announced plans to launch its own game streaming service Project xCloud, which allows players to play while on the go. The service was launched in October this year in the US and UK. The timing of Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard is also strategic. With the arrival of the next generation of gaming consoles, and the revolutionary transformation of streaming technology to the game experience, the industry is expected to undergo a huge transformation in the coming years. Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard can give it an edge in this rapidly evolving environment. Even if the Federal Trade Commission ultimately approves a merger, it could be a loss to competition. The deal may provoke outrage from consumer advocacy groups that have long considered such deals to be anti-competitive and lead to higher consumer prices. But antitrust experts say that the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) review of the deal is likely to be a public and private case. The acquisition of Activision Blizzard could bring the gaming industry closer to monopoly, and the European Commission might conclude that the deal was not in the best interests of consumers.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".. With the gradual end of travel restrictions around the world, travelers have been keen to take advantage of a handful of countries reopening their borders. One of them is China, which announced that it will reopen some of its destinations for international visitors starting in January 2021. The Chinese government has stated that travellers from certain countries can enter China through valid visas or negative COVID-19 tests, in addition to taking quarantine measures upon arrival.The Chinese government also made clear that the main criterion for entry is compliance with prescribed health and safety requirements. The news of China's reopening of its borders has been welcomed by travelers eager to return to the country, as well as those keen to visit it for the first time. \"I plan to travel to China because I can't wait to see the Great Wall and experience Chinese culture,\" said Jerry Choy, a travel enthusiast from the United States. \"I am delighted to be able to visit China again and explore the wonders of the Middle Kingdom.\" \"China is an amazing country with a rich cultural heritage, and I'm delighted to be able to visit it again,\" said Canadian traveller Tricia Thomson. \"I look forward to some incredible adventures in China as well as visiting some amazing cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.\" The reopening of China's borders has also generated a lot of interest in the tourism industry, and many travel companies are taking advantage of this situation to offer travel packages suitable for travelers from different countries. Chris Martin, CEO of a major travel operator, said: \"We are delighted to provide visitors with the opportunity to experience the wonders of China and we have been working hard to ensure that our customers have the best experiences, the best hotels, attractions and events in the country. We want to ensure that our customers get the full Chinese experience, and they feel safe and secure here.\" For those interested in visiting China but concerned about safety, there are also companies offering COVID-19 insurance packages. These packages can provide health insurance and other necessary services if a traveler is infected during the trip. The news of China's reopening also benefits airlines, hotels and other tourism-related businesses. As the number of international visitors increases, China's tourism industry is expected to see a huge increase in economic activity. While the reopening of China's borders is something to celebrate, it also means that tourists must be especially careful when traveling to China. The Chinese government strictly enforces safety regulations and travelers must comply with rules set by authorities. For travelers planning to travel to China, it is important to keep up with the latest news and ensure that they have all the necessary documents and tests required for entry.It is also recommended that travellers purchase comprehensive travel insurance to cover any unexpected event costs. To sum up, the reopening of China's borders is an exciting development for both travelers and businesses. It marks the beginning of a new era in the country, and it is hoped that visitors will soon be able to experience the wonders of China again.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Razors\n\nDoes a simple manual razor count as a gadget? Well, with the more desirable razors on the market boasting features like multiple blades and lubricating strips, the answer is yes. But listener Tim wants to know, do all the advertised fancy features, multiple blades and higher price tags really make a difference to your shave?\n\nSome shaving brands claim to have superior blades coated in chromium, or shaped like a 'gothic arch', but consultant dermatologist Dr Bav Shergill says the single most important feature is that the blade is \"really sharp\".\n\nMany of the more expensive razors have five blades. Dr Frauke Neuser from Gillette says the point of multiple blades is that you're cutting each hair multiple times, achieving a closer shave. But the main driver for more blades is actually comfort. It spreads the pressure, which means \"less skin bulging, less tug and pull, and an easy glide\".\n\nAre there benefits to lubricating strips? Bav isn\u2019t convinced. \"You're already hopefully putting a lubricant on your face with the shaving oil or shaving gel,\" he flags. But Frauke insists that the added lubrication is for when you take a second stroke, so you \"still get that protection and the easier glide\".\n\nGillette Labs Exfoliating Razor is 75 times the cost of a Bic disposable razor. Is it worth it? \"It's the engineering that goes into them,\" Frauke claims. \"Durability also plays a big role.\" Bav agrees that it is worth splashing out \u2013 on more blades and bells and whistles \u2013 because, as you're essentially doing a cosmetic treatment every time you shave, ease of use is key. That doesn't, however, mean you need to go absolutely top of the range.\n\nAnd a 'closer shave' isn\u2019t for everyone. This can actually lead to ingrowing hairs and irritation. If you have sensitive skin, five blades may not be for you. And perhaps avoid 'exfoliating bars', as these could irritate the skin further.\n\nElectric toothbrushes\n\nManual toothbrush user Holly got in touch to ask if an electric brush would save her costly trips to the dentist. And will a more expensive model really clean her teeth better?\n\nThe big players in the market are Oral-B and Philips. Oral-B's toothbrush heads oscillate at about 70 times a second. Philips's brushes use vibrations, with the bristles moving side to side at high speed. \"In terms of the different technologies, there\u2019s not a lot in it,\" says Damien Walmsley, Professor of Restorative Dentistry.\n\nPrices can be eyewatering: Oral-B's top brush \u2013 the iO9 \u2013 retails at \u00a3500. In this price range, brushes come with features like apps that feedback on your brushing technique. Paying more may also get you a longer battery life, suggests Which? researcher Matt Knight.\n\nHowever, when Which? rated numerous electric models, they found that there was no direct link between price and the quality of the clean. \"I'd be aware of the claims the toothbrush will clean your teeth better, because in many cases we found that isn\u2019t necessarily the case,\" says Matt.\n\nIn terms of the cleaning properties of manual versus electric, Damien thinks that there is very little difference between the two. But manual toothbrushing does rely on good technique so electric toothbrushes remove the room for human error. Whether the snazzy apps (and associated price hike) will be a help or a hindrance is down to you.", "label": "human"}
{"text": ".. Asia-Pacific markets rose on Wednesday as the Chinese government reopened its border with Hong Kong, bringing the region closer to economic recovery. Since the British colonies returned to Chinese sovereignty before 1997, Hong Kong has been in a long-standing state of hostility and is caught up in a trade war. Tensions have been high in recent years, with China introducing a series of new laws in Hong Kong and protesters calling for greater autonomy. On Wednesday, the Chinese government announced that it would lift some restrictions on its land border with Hong Kong to allow more movement of goods, services, capital and people between the two places. This move is seen as a sign of both sides' willingness to reconcile and mark a new era in bilateral relations. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 2.1% and the Shanghai Composite Index grew 1.4%. Elsewhere, South Korea's Cosby Index rose 1.2%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.5%. Market experts say that the improvement of China-Hong Kong relations is a good sign for the Asia-Pacific region, which has been locked in a trade war for many years. With the reopening of the border, it is expected that cross-border investment and tourism will increase, boosting economic growth in the region. \"Opening the border between China and Hong Kong, allowing for more direct investment and cross-border trade, could have a significant positive impact across the region,\" said Stephen Innes, chief Asia market strategist at AxiCorp. The new arrangement will also help ease concerns about the region's economic situation, with some economists predicting an end to the trade war could provide a much-needed boost to the region's economy. \"This is a positive development because it eliminates one of the long-standing risks in the region and could lead to strong growth in trade, investment and tourism that will benefit all countries in the region,\" said Jeffrey Sacker, senior Asia analyst at BNP Paribas. The reopening of the border is seen as a sign that both sides are willing to move forward and resolve their differences. It is also seen as a gesture of goodwill ahead of the second round of U.S.-China trade talks scheduled to begin next month. \"Reopening the border could mark a potential breakthrough in U.S.-China trade talks, as both sides have expressed willingness to compromise and try to resolve their differences,\" said Caroline Yeow, senior economist at Royal Bank of Canada. The news was welcomed by investors, who were delighted to hear that both sides were making progress in resolving their differences. \"The news of China and Hong Kong reopening their borders is very welcome and may help lay the groundwork for a more positive outcome in U.S.-China trade talks,\" said Stephen Nash, portfolio manager at Value Partners. Open borders could pave the way for greater economic integration and smoother trade and investment flows in the region. In the long run, lifting restrictions would help boost economic growth across the Asia-Pacific region.", "label": "machine"}

Meanwhile, over the next two years, he will have to answer a few key questions as he weighs on what to do next. First, Iger must consider whether he will continue as the current CEO. The senior executive has expressed a desire to remain in this position on the grounds that he is very proud of what the company accomplished during his tenure. However, there are rumors that Iger is considering retirement, and the board must decide whether to extend Iger's contract. Over the past year, Disney has been forced to take significant cost-cutting measures and make difficult decisions about which properties to prioritize in the short term. Iger will have to ensure that these decisions are in the best interests of the company's long-term growth and strategy. With the launch of Disney+, the company has entered the streaming war, and Iger will have to ensure that Disney is competitive in this area. This may require significant investments in technology, content, and partnerships, and Iger will need to make sure these investments take full advantage of existing opportunities. Fourth, Iger must decide how to make the best use of Disney's vast intellectual property portfolio. The company has a large collection of films, TV shows and person directories that can generate revenue in new and innovative ways. Disney is a leader in streaming, but there are other areas the company can seek to capitalize on. Iger must ensure that Disney actively looks for new opportunities and finds ways to use its existing assets to stay competitive in a rapidly changing environment.

{"text": ".. Just three months after the Fed raised its benchmark rate for the first time in nine years, it's gratifying that wage and employment growth exceeded expectations in November, bringing an unexpected rise to monetary policy tightening. According to the Labor Department, employers added 211,000 jobs in November, well above the expected 195,000 new jobs. The unemployment rate has stabilized at 5.0 per cent, the lowest level since April 2008, while wages have accelerated to 2.3 per cent from 1.9 per cent in October. \"These figures are not in the chart,\" said Nathan Sheets, chief U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight. \"We have achieved a strong near-full employment environment and now there are signs of significant wage growth.\" The news comes at a time when many expect the tightening of U.S. monetary policy to put downward pressure on jobs and wage growth. But based on recent labor market data, the Fed may have correctly judged the economy's ability to withstand higher interest rates. \"The U.S. economy continues to move forward, and labor market expansion remains strong,\" said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com. \"Today's strong report shows that there is more upside potential for growth and further job growth.\" The Labor Department's report also shows an increase in labor force participation, indicating that employers are increasing the working hours of existing workers rather than adding new ones. The average hourly earnings of all private sector employees (a key indicator of inflation) rose 2.3% from a year ago, the largest annual increase since December 2013, followed closely by October's 1.9%. \"Higher wages indicate that job seekers have greater bargaining power,\" said JJ Kinahan, chief marketing strategist at TD Ameritrade, adding: \"Retailers will have to offer better incentives to attract those important holiday shoppers, which will put pressure on the bottom line.\" The Fed has raised its benchmark rate twice this year to between 1.25% and 1.50%. Given the strong jobs report, investors will wait to see if the Fed sends a signal of further increase in the coming months. \"The Fed may decide to sit tight,\" said Michael Arcuri, an investment adviser at NerdWallet. \"The hawkish view is that higher interest rates encourage banks to lend more, which stimulates the economy and leads to more jobs and higher wages.\" Hamrick said the jobs report \"strongly demonstrates that the Fed's recent monetary policy has been prudent.\" \"Nevertheless, the Fed is not done yet, so it will be interesting to see how it decides to deal with rate hikes.\" The jobs report is a welcome surprise for many, and can be seen as a sign of the Fed's success in stimulating economic growth. In November, the U.S. economy added more than 200,000 jobs, wage growth accelerated, labor force participation increased, and unemployment remained stable. These figures suggest that economic growth is likely to remain strong in the coming months and that the Fed's rate hike policy may be the right choice. These data could also lead to further increases in wages, as employers are forced to compete for qualified workers. As the U.S. economy continues to grow jobs and wages accelerate, the Fed may just have proven that it can raise interest rates without sacrificing economic performance.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Online sales during the holiday season rose 3.5% year over year to $211.7 billion, according to Adobe Analytics, as record-high discounts persuaded shoppers to open up their wallets.\n\nThat spending marked a new peak for e-commerce sales during the crucial retail season, according to Adobe.\n\nYet markdowns played a key role in moving merchandise. Overall spending got a boost from key shopping holidays that typically bring the deepest discounts. Online sales during Cyber Week, the five-day period from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, totaled about $35.3 billion.\n\nVivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, said the script has flipped from the previous year. Customers were willing to pay more in 2021 for holiday purchases as retailers ran low on products. Now, he said, shoppers have become more frugal and will hold out for a lower price.\n\n\"Retailers have to really adjust to the consumers' terms now,\" he said. \"They're in a much different position than where they were during the pandemic where it was just about the consumer trying to acquire goods as quickly as possible and the retailers were really in the driver's seat.\"\n\nThe latest holiday numbers come as retailers brace for a tougher year and see signs that some consumers may be running out of gas. As inflation remains high, Americans are running up credit card balances and socking away less money in savings accounts. Sales of some big-ticket items, such as jewelry and consumer electronics, have declined. And retailers have marked down merchandise and scaled back orders to clear through excess inventory and prepare for a potential recession.\n\nFood and housing costs, in particular, have shot up in price, taking a bigger chunk out of Americans' budgets. Inflation rose less than expected in November, but was still up 7.1% year over year, according to the Labor Department.\n\nOnline retailers have gotten price-sensitive customers to press the \"buy\" button with steep promotions. Prices dropped on major retailers' websites during the holidays, and discounting levels were deeper than ever, according to Adobe.\n\nToy discounts peaked at 34% off listed price during the holiday season, up from 19% in the year-ago period. Electronics discounts peaked at 25%, up from 8% in the year-ago period. And apparel peaked at 19%, up from 13% a year ago.\n\nComputers, TVs, appliances and sporting goods were also more promotional, Adobe found.\n\nAccording to Adobe's Digital Price Index, which tracks e-commerce prices across 18 categories, prices online have been falling year over year since September. That means the 3.5% increase was driven by net new demand rather than fueled by inflated prices.\n\nPandya said the deep discounts likely helped retailers sell off the glut of merchandise that had piled up in warehouses and store backrooms. Many retailers, including Target , Walmart and Kohl's , have faced a jump in inventory levels as popular Covid pandemic categories fell out of favor and inflation weighed on household budgets.\n\nIn a separate report, which includes in-store spending, holiday sales rose 7.6% in stores and online from Nov. 1 to Dec. 24, according to data from Mastercard SpendingPulse. The figure includes all forms of payment and restaurant spending. It is not adjusted for inflation.\n\nOnline sales have become a more meaningful part of holiday spending because of the pandemic, but most sales still take place at stores.\n\nE-commerce drove 21.6% of total retail sales over the holidays this year, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse. It's a slight increase over the holiday seasons in 2021 and 2020, when e-commerce made up 20.9% and 20.6% of total sales, respectively, but a notable jump from the same period in 2019 when it accounted for 14.6% of sales.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "In the original Indiana waters, record-breaking catches can be easily produced. In mid-January, a new Indiana Burbot record was set after the capture of a 9.19-pound rabies in Patoka River in southwestern Indiana - the largest rabies ever recorded in Hoosier state. The fish was landed by Brian Hines, a professional fisherman who has been fishing in Indiana and other nearby states for 15 years. \"I went fishing with my friends and we kept throwing crabfish and mountain water around, but actually nothing happened,\" Hines said. \"So I decided to turn to the bottom fish, and that's when I fell into record-breaking rabies. Heinz immediately knew it was a big fish, but he didn't know it was record-breaking. \"I didn't know how big it was until I put it on the boat and we weighed,\" he said. The 9.80-pound buffalo caught on the Wabash River in December 2014 was the fourth largest Buffalo ever recorded in Indiana. \"It's been a great experience and definitely something I won't forget,\" Hines said. Burbot, also known as a freshwater cod, is a type of cod found in the Northern Hemisphere. It lives in cool deep water in the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic Oceans. In Indiana, water otters have been found in the Mome River, Ohio, Wabbash River, St. Joseph River and Patoka Rivers; they are most often caught by fishermen who fish deep into river ponds and slow-flow waters. In order to maintain record-breaking fish, fishermen must submit an application to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR). Fish must be weighed and measured on certified scales with a photo taken as evidence. In December 2014, Michael Mayo discovered the current national record of Butterbo on the Bartoka River. The Boutebo in Mayo weighs 9.80 pounds and is 24.5 inches long. Although not a record catch every day, Indiana's waters are easy to produce large fish.Anglomerians can easily find several types of fish, including bees, vitiligo, cats and even mosses. So, if you're looking for an opportunity to break the Indiana record, go out and start fishing. You never know what you'll catch.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "2016 - Pipeline For years, power customers in Colorado, Georgia, and Tennessee have complained about their grids being unreliable. Now, after an unusually long period of blackout in the region, some utility customers and activists are calling on the Tennessee Valley Authority to scrutinize its reliance on natural gas pipelines. For decades, U.S. government-owned utilities and power producer TVA have provided reliable electricity to millions of people in the South. But a series of power outages triggered by winter storms left parts of the region without power for days at the end of the month. The pipeline issue has fueled calls from TV associations to move toward cleaner energy and build a more resilient and flexible grid. \"TVA has an opportunity to rethink its energy strategy,\" said Ruth Ann Norton, executive director of the Green and Healthy Homes Initiative, which is leading an effort to replace gas infrastructure in the southeast with more reliable, distributed electricity. \"They can lower energy costs, create more reliability and reduce emissions, all at the same time,\" she said. That's a previous call, but Norton and her allies, including some environmentalists, believe the breadth and intensity of this month's disruption provide a new sense of urgency for their efforts. \"This should be a wake-up call,\" said Nikita Parekh, executive director of the Climate Council, who advocates for increased investment in renewable energy such as solar and wind. \"Our current energy networks are not reliable or adaptable to climate change, and we must rethink how we can power our homes and businesses.\" Some of the pipelines that supply gas to power plants in Tennessee, Georgia and North Carolina and South Carolina have been shut down due to cold temperatures and snow and ice. TVA did not respond to a request for comment, but it blamed part of the power outage on gas pipeline disruptions. \"We have more energy than we have the capacity to transmit and supply more gas than we have,\" TVA spokeswoman Kim Sizemore said this month. The incident has sparked criticism of utilities' reliance on natural gas pipelines and raised questions about whether more should be done to promote distributed energy sources such as renewable or solar, which allow households and businesses to generate their own electricity. \"Recent events are a perfect example of how vulnerable the grid is to shocks,\" Pareh said. In recent years, TVA has made progress in reducing its reliance on coal, investing in wind and solar energy, but Pareh and others say it's time to consider taking the next steps to get rid of dependence on natural gas. \"TVA has taken a leadership role in adopting cleaner energy, but progress is slow to adopt distributed energy,\" said Norton. \"It's time for TVA to make greater commitments on local renewable energy.\" Norton's organization is working with cities, states and organizations in the southeast to replace natural gas pipelines with more reliable distributed energy. She said TVA could use its influence and financial leverage to help achieve that goal. \"We know there's a solution,\" she said, \"and it's time for TVA to take action.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "BofA has added a number of biotechnology stocks \u2014 a sector that is hot on Wall Street right now \u2013 to its list of top picks for the first quarter. The bank identified the biotech stocks, as well as some medical technology companies, as part of its thematic investing picks, on themes it says are related to a \"transforming world.\" BofA listed the stocks under themes such as ageing, obesity and pandemic. Under the pandemic theme, the bank referred to \"disease X\" \u2014 a term that has surfaced following Covid-19 referring to the next unknown pandemic that could hit the world \u2013 adding that there are stock opportunities across vaccines, testing, ventilators and work-from-home practices. The bank added biotech firm BioNTech , as well as medical equipment company ResMed , to its list under this theme. In ageing, BofA highlights the potential of the \"silver economy\" and says there's $15 trillion baby boomer spending power in the U.S. alone, with opportunities across health care, aged care, and consumer sectors. The bank added medical technology firm Silk Road Medical , along with biotech firms Cerevel and Denali , to its list of stocks to play this theme. The issue of obesity also presents opportunities across pharmaceutical, healthy eating and wellness, according to BofA. The World Health Organisation puts the number of people worldwide who are overweight or obese at 1.9 billion. One of Bank of America's new additions under this theme is medical equipment company ResMed . All of the stocks are buy-rated by BofA analysts. A bright spot amid the gloom? Wall Street is optimistic on biotechnology and pharmaceuticals heading into 2023 , even as the overall market appears uncertain amid recession fears. The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index lost 11% for 2022, compared to the Nasdaq which dived 33%, and the S & P 500 which sank nearly 20%. The NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index gained nearly 5% for the year. Morgan Stanley views biotechnology as an area full of opportunity heading into this year, while Citi says it's a \"stock-pickers market\" in the sector , which is set to outperform even in a recession scenario. \"Looking to 2023, we still see room for larger-cap biopharma to benefit broadly (at least early in the year) given the lingering recession concerns and attractive valuation vs. the broader market,\" Barclays added in a late December note. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "TG Therapy (TGTX), Micron Technology (MU) and Charging Points (CHPT) made some of the biggest moves at noon on Thursday, up 5%, 4% and 4% respectively. Shares of a biopharmaceutical company, TG Therapeutics, have soared as the company reported that its drug for treating a multiple sclerosis has successfully conducted a second phase of trials. The drug showed significant improvements in patients compared to placebos. The company now plans to conduct more clinical studies to further verify the effectiveness of its drug. Micron's stock price rose after memory and storage companies reported a pick-up in both up and down the line. Its revenue and earnings were higher than expected, and demand for its chips remained strong. The company is deploying new EV stations across the city, aiming to make electric vehicles easier to use. This move is seen as an important positive factor for the company because it wants to enter the growing market of electric vehicles. Elsewhere, MDC Partners (MDCA) shares plunged after advertising, marketing and communications holdings reported more than expected quarterly losses. The company blamed weakness for high spending in the weak first quarter, including costs associated with its non-core portfolio of assets. On the other hand, Etsy (ETSY) shares soared after online markets and hand-made products companies reported better than expected earnings in the fourth quarter. The company's revenue grew as strong demand for its products continued to drive sales. It also updated its guidelines for 2021, noting that its revenues are expected to grow within a percentage range of the mid-20th century. On the economic front, the U.S. Department of Labor released a weekly unemployment report. Initial applications dropped to 745,000, slightly lower than expected at 755,000. Overall, it was a mixed day as investors analyzed the economic and corporate news of the day. Despite the unbalanced meeting, the stock market rose for the fourth consecutive day and hovered near historic highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4%, the S&P 500 index rose 0.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.3%. TG Therapeutics, Micron Technology, ChargePoint and others made the biggest progress in the stock market at noon on Thursday. TG Therapeutics' drug advancements in clinical trials, Micron's strong quarterly earnings, and ChargePoint's expansion of electric vehicles in New York fueled each share's growth. Meanwhile, MDC Partners and Etsy reported their quarterly results, with the former falling and the latter rising. On the economic front, the Labor Department released its weekly unemployment claims report, which shows that the labor market continues to slowly recover.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".. Passengers flying with major airlines have entrusted their safety to the crew, but a shocking report released today shows female job seekers having to undress so that recruiters can check scars, birth marks or tattoos. The report, published in the British newspaper The Guardian, said some airlines \"effectively select crew based on their appearance.\" It quoted some applicants as saying they felt \"degenerate\" and \"shameful\" because they had to expose their bodies in order to be considered for work. The Guardian reported that major airlines including British Airways, Air France, Lufthansa, Ryanair and EasyJet have adopted policies requiring female crew members to wear \"dresses, white shirts, no jewelry, and must be disguised, with clear nails and clear skin\" for interviews. It also said that some recruiters asked female applicants to take off their underwear so they could check for any body modifications, such as tattoos or punctures. The report notes that some airlines have changed their hiring policies, while others are reportedly reviewing their policies after disclosure. Over the past few years, the airliner recruitment industry has come under intense scrutiny, with some observers saying it's outdated and focused too much on looks rather than skills. In recent years, steps have been taken to introduce more gender-neutral uniforms, while some airlines have relaxed their dressing standards and started allowing crew members to wear makeup. However, despite these developments, the Guardian report shows that some airlines still rely heavily on traditional gender stereotypes when recruiting flight attendants. It said that on some flight attendant recruitment days, female applicants were given \"beauty bags\" containing items such as lipstick, hairstyles and basics, while their male counterparts were given hairstyles and makeup. The report quoted a female applicant as saying she had been told to take off her underwear so that recruiters could \"check if there are any traces of her body, tattoo or tattoo.\" The applicant said the experience was \"really uncomfortable\" and made her feel \"degenerate.\" The report also pointed out that some recruitment agencies used \"top-down gender categories\" when selecting applicants for crew positions, with some preferring tall, thin, white women and short men. It quoted another applicant as saying: \"It's a bit derogatory, it's the kind of mindset that people of some age and gender should be looking at in some way.\" Several airlines contacted by The Guardian said they have changed their hiring policies to no longer require female crew members to apply for stripping. British Airways told The Guardian it was \"committed to a fair and respectful recruitment process\", while Lufthansa said it was \"committed to equal opportunity and inclusion of all genders, backgrounds and disabilities\". The aviation industry is the world's largest employer, employing more than 2.6 million people worldwide. The Guardian's report could spark further debate about global aviation industry standards and practices, as well as what can be done to ensure a fair and inclusive recruitment process for crew members.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "For more than a decade, the global economy has been trapped in long-term low inflation, but analysts are increasingly pointing to signs that this trend may soon reverse. This could be good news for investors who have been avoiding bonds lately, as higher levels of inflation might make their investments more attractive. The global economy's recovery from the 2020 pandemic shock is characterised by its weak inflationary pressure, as central banks have maintained policy easing and fiscal stimulus has failed to gain much momentum. But as vaccine roll-out accelerates, more countries are able to return to normal, and analysts expect a gradual resurgence of inflation. After all, they tend to benefit from rising inflation expectations, because higher inflation means higher yields on long-term bonds. This relationship has been weakened in recent years by central bank actions, but if inflation continues to rise, it may provide an opportunity for investors looking for yields. One area in the bond market that could benefit particularly from high inflation is \"broad\" bonds, which have been sold out over the past year or so as a result of worsening economic prospects and investors becoming more risk-free. High yield bonds are especially hard hit because companies' revenue has been affected by the pandemic. For investors, however, these bonds may now be an attractive proposition, because if inflation expectations start to pick up, their prices could begin to recover. This is especially true for long-term high yield bonds, which face higher inflation risks than short-term bonds. They are high-risk investments, which can lead to losses if the inflationary background is not achieved or a downward trend in the economic recovery occurs. Nevertheless, these bonds may be a potentially attractive option for investors looking for yields, and it may be an opportunity worth considering for those who are willing to take on high-risk bond bets.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "According to court documents, Twitter Inc. faces a lawsuit for failing to pay the rent of its San Francisco office. A lawsuit filed Wednesday in the San Francisco High Court claimed that Twitter had not paid rent for its San Francisco office since May. The company reportedly agreed to lease a two-story office building at 1355 Market Street for two years in October 2020. Twitter was accused of failing to pay all the rent agreed upon in the lease, and did not provide any notice or explanation. The lawsuit also alleged that Twitter refused to negotiate with the landlord, who claimed more than $400,000 in unpaid rents and fees. Owner Marker Development Corp. also accused Twitter of breaching the contract, claiming that the social media giant had violated its lease terms by failing to pay rent on time and negotiate with landlords. The lawsuit seeks more than $400,000 in unpaid rent, as well as other losses and legal fees. This isn't the first time Twitter has come under fire for not paying office rent. In October, the company was accused of failing to pay rent at its offices in Dublin, Ireland. Twitter reported a net loss of $107 million in the first quarter of 2021, its first quarterly loss in more than a decade. Facebook has also been struggling to cope with slow user growth, leading to declining advertising revenue. Twitter has not publicly commented on the lawsuit. However, a source familiar with the matter told Business Insider that the company does not consider the lawsuit to be valid and intends to defend itself in court. If the court ruling is in favour of Marker Development Corp., it could open the door to similar lawsuits by other landlords seeking unpaid rents. It has already paid hundreds of millions of dollars in stock and cash bonuses to employees this year. A successful lawsuit could mean additional costs for the company. The lawsuit may also raise concerns among investors about the company's financial condition and its ability to manage it. Any further complications could affect Twitter's share price as well. The company will now have to face the cost of defending itself in court, as well as any potential settlement costs that a successful lawsuit could entail. At the same time, the company will continue to focus on improving its user growth and monetization strategy to stabilize its financial performance.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Humans last set foot on the moon 50 years ago. Now we\u2019re going back, but the way we explore space has gone through some big changes.\n\nIn December of 1972, the astronaut Eugene Cernan left his footprints and daughter\u2019s initials in the lunar dust. In doing so, he became the last man to set foot on the moon. Now, after 50 years, humanity is going back. But in the half century since Apollo 17, a lot has changed in how we explore space\u2014and how we see our place in it.\n\nWhile those early missions were all run by governments, much of modern spaceflight is the domain of billionaires and their private companies. Commercial space travel has brought a new way of thinking about trips outside Earth\u2019s gravity, with tourism turning space into a vacation and something of a status symbol. It\u2019s also widened the range of people who go to space from the clean-cut white male astronauts of the Apollo era.\n\nNew visitors bring new perspectives to space, and that diversity could well change our relationship to it. A year ago, at 90 years old, the actor William Shatner rode one of Jeff Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin spacecraft. But as he told staff writer Marina Koren, his time in space didn\u2019t line up with the optimism of Star Trek\u2019s Captain Kirk.\n\nKoren and fellow staff writer Adam Harris discuss our changing relationship with space on an episode of the podcast Radio Atlantic. They also listen to some of Koren\u2019s interview with Shatner. You can hear their conversation here:\n\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\n\nAdam Harris: This is Radio Atlantic. I\u2019m Adam Harris.\n\nMarina Koren: And I\u2019m Marina Koren.\n\nHarris: This week on the show, we\u2019re talking about space. We just heard some of our colleagues\u2019 kids talking about space. As a parent myself, it feels like the images of space are inescapable. One of the first T-shirts I remember buying for my daughter was a NASA T-shirt. We have blankets in our house that have moons and rocket ships on them. Is that your recollection of childhood?\n\nKoren: Definitely. I had those glow-in-the-dark stars on my ceiling. Occasionally one would fall off and spook me, but I recently got a set for my 3-year old nephew. This is a go-to source of wonder and excitement for kids, for sure.\n\nHarris: And I should say that we are both staff writers, but you are the one on the space beat.\n\nKoren: Yes, I am The Atlantic\u2019s outer space bureau chief.\n\nHarris: (Laughs.) And it\u2019s been a big year to be a space reporter, right?\n\nKoren: It has, yeah! We are definitely in this strange new era of exploration. It\u2019s been 50 years since the last time human beings have set foot on the moon. 1972 was Apollo 17, the final moon landing.\n\nI think the universe is a lot more familiar to us now, because we\u2019ve come such a long way. But something that\u2019s really different now is that you have commercial companies that are doing the work that was traditionally done by governments. There\u2019s SpaceX, Elon Musk\u2019s company, and Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos\u2019s venture.\n\nAnd even 10 years ago, if you told someone that SpaceX will be launching people to the International Space Station, they might have laughed at you. It seemed ridiculous, but this is the reality now.\n\nIt feels like we\u2019re in this strange sci-fi future where space travel is something you can buy. It\u2019s a type of vacation. And it\u2019s become a status symbol in a way.\n\nBut now people can go to space and come back and tell everyone: \u201cWell, I\u2019ve been to space. I\u2019ve done something that only about 600 or so people have done in the history of humankind.\u201d\n\nHarris: Before private space travel, [when you think of people going to space,] you think of folks like John Glenn or Buzz Aldrin. It\u2019s someone with military training who has studied to be an astronaut like their entire life. What does it mean that that\u2019s no longer the only type of person that\u2019s going into space?\n\nKoren: I think that spaceflight is about to get really, really interesting because the stories that we\u2019ve heard from spacefarers have come from a specific group of people. These were, more often than not, white men with military backgrounds, trained in a certain workplace culture that values \u201cthe Right Stuff.\u201d It values being stoic and unafraid in the face of something dangerous.\n\nBut in this new era of commercial spaceflight, you\u2019re gonna be seeing a wide range of participants. There will hopefully be more women, more people of color, people from underrepresented groups, from different educational and socioeconomic backgrounds, and people with just a wide range of experiences.\n\nHarris: And what are the stories that we\u2019ve already heard about the experiences in space, right? These professional astronauts, when they come back, what do they say space was like?\n\nKoren: Yeah, there are a few common themes. So people, when these astronauts have gone to space and they\u2019ve seen Earth from that perspective, they have been overcome with emotion at the beauty of Earth. And it suddenly becomes very clear just how thin our atmosphere is. And that is the only thing that really protects our planet from everything else. They\u2019re struck by the fragility of the planet.\n\nAnd then something else also happens to a lot of astronauts when they go to space\u2014they suddenly feel a sense of connectedness with their fellow human beings down below. Because from space, you can\u2019t see any national borders. It\u2019s just continents and seas and clouds. And so, many astronauts have come home and described these feelings. And the stories are indicative of a cognitive shift, almost, that is known as \u201cthe overview effect.\u201d\n\nAnd I\u2019ve talked to astronauts who say that they were taken aback by the borderless world and how beautiful it is, how it made them feel like: Why are we at war? Why is there conflict? We\u2019re one planet. It made them feel whole.\n\nI\u2019ve also talked to one academic who did an extensive study of astronauts\u2014and she couldn\u2019t reveal this astronaut\u2019s name to me\u2014but she said that this person, when he went into space, he took one look out the window and was convinced that humanity was going to destroy itself in some hundred-number of years. And so that experience could be profound and inspiring to one person, but it could also actually make another feel despair.\n\nAnd what\u2019s happening now with space tourism and private spaceflight is that the people going into space now have heard these stories of the overview effect. It\u2019s a thing. And so they\u2019re expecting to feel a certain way when they go to space. They\u2019re expecting to have a profound change on their perspective of the world, and even maybe on their personalities. And so I wonder if we\u2019re kind of over-hyping that. And I have talked to a few professional NASA astronauts who agree. They worry that these spaceflight companies and their sales pitches to customers are overselling the effects of the overview effect. It\u2019s not a guarantee. It\u2019s not a gift from the universe. It\u2019s something that a person experiences and feels individually. And your mileage will vary.\n\nHarris: Yeah. And you said these flights are like a couple of minutes. Is that enough time to change you?\n\nKoren: That is a great question. So I talked to Frank White, the author who coined the term \u201cthe overview effect.\u201d He came up with it when he was flying on a plane\u2014so, not in space, but he had a pretty good view\u2014and he got to thinking: Future generations of humans who might be living and working in space would have this distant view of Earth all the time. And they would have these insights that regular earthbound people lack.\n\nAnd he was surprised that people who were flying on Blue Origin and having a few minutes of weightlessness were coming home and talking as if they had had this profound experience. They were saying it changed them. And he was surprised because he thought that in order to really get the full hit of the overview effect, you had to spend some time in space. Weeks to months in orbit around Earth, or even all the way out on the moon.\n\nSo, that\u2019s kind of the literature that we\u2019re working with here. And I think that\u2019s what\u2019s going to change in this era of commercial spaceflight, because you are going to have people who are not like the Apollo astronauts. And they\u2019re going to be coming home with different stories and really widening the overview effect that we\u2019ve become familiar with as a public.\n\nAnd the future participants won\u2019t be restricted by some of the constraints that the professional astronauts were. If you were a professional astronaut and you went to space and you didn\u2019t have a great time, I don\u2019t think you could say that once you came back from space, because that could potentially affect your future flight assignments. You had to have a certain response on your way home. And so I think we\u2019re about to hear some of the most honest stories of spaceflight that we\u2019ve ever heard before.\n\nHarris: Is the overview effect real? If we only have this limited pool of stories to pull from, is that theory a real thing? Have all of the folks who have gone up to space shared that view?\n\nKoren: That\u2019s a great question. And I think the way we talk about the overview effect, it becomes like this mystical, magical thing. Astronauts are revered people. Even when I\u2019ve interviewed astronauts, when they walk into the room in their full flight suits with all their mission patches on the fabric, you can\u2019t help but feel intimidated. Because you think: Wow, this person has seen something that I\u2019ve never seen.\n\nAnd so we think of the overview effect and the experience that people should have in space as something that the universe gives us. But it\u2019s actually a cultural phenomenon. It has been shaped by a certain group of people working under a certain set of pressures who wanted to make sure that they could fly again.\n\nSo they couldn\u2019t say anything outrageous. And the overview effect also came out of a certain time and place. Many of these stories come from the midst of the space race, in the middle of the Cold War. That definitely shapes a person\u2019s perspective. So I would say that seeing Earth from space is not a one-size-fits-all reaction.\n\nHarris: What are some of the interviews that stuck out because they may have differed from this idea of an overview effect?\n\nKoren: So I spoke with William Shatner about his space flight. He was 90 years old when he took that trip. I recorded some of my conversation with Shatner. And he said it was a really transformational experience, but not for the reasons that we\u2019re used to hearing.\n\nHarris: So you got to talk to Captain Kirk?\n\nKoren: I did, yes! I will admit: I have never seen Star Trek before.\n\nHarris: So we have a space reporter who\u2019s never seen Star Trek?\n\nKoren: (Laughs.) I haven\u2019t. But you\u2019ve seen it, right?\n\nHarris: I have seen Star Trek. It was playing pretty frequently on our TVs when I was a kid. My dad rarely missed episodes or reruns. [But] for people like Marina who don\u2019t know who Captain Kirk is: He\u2019s the captain of the starship Enterprise on Star Trek in the 1960s. The original captain. And he was this really optimistic figure\u2014this really sort of classical hero. [But] what did Shatner have to say about going to space? Actually being there?\n\nKoren: When I talked to him, it was about a year after his experience, and the flight was still really fresh in his mind. I asked him how he was feeling a year out, and he dove right into a Shatner-esque monologue about going to space.\n\nWilliam Shatner: We had emerged from the film of air that surrounds the Earth, and we\u2019re weightless. I got out of my five-point harness and made my way to the window. I saw a wake of air. Like a submarine might leave in the water.\n\nAnd then I looked to my right, which was facing space. When I looked up there, I saw nothing but blank, palpable space. The blackness was so overwhelming. My immediate thought was: My God, that\u2019s death.\n\nAnd then I looked back, and I could see with great clarity the beginning of the circumference line of the Earth. The color of the desert that I had just left, which was beige. The whiteness of the clouds. The blueness of the air. And those three colors in deference to the blackness\u2014I was overwhelmed by the sense of death and overwhelmed by the sense-nurturing by the Earth.\n\nKoren: When Shatner came back from his quick trip to space, he\u2019s standing outside the capsule; there\u2019s other people around him. Jeff Bezos is there. Bezos is popping champagne like a frat boy. And Shatner is just standing there, super still.\n\nShatner: I didn\u2019t know what I was feeling, but I was weeping, and I didn\u2019t know why. Everybody else was celebrating. It took me a couple of hours sitting by myself to understand that what I was feeling was grief. And the grief for the Earth.\n\nKoren: He is overcome with emotion. He is weeping, and then he starts saying how he was just taken aback by the blackness of space, the ugliness of space, how it looked like death.\n\nSo Shatner was super, super honest about his experience. And when I talked to him, he said that that grief was still with him. Earth was beautiful and gleaming and delicate from that perspective, but it just reminded him of everything that\u2019s wrong on the ground and particularly made him think about how unstoppable climate change feels.\n\nAnd so for him, this was in many ways a negative experience. And Shatner was starting to cry when we were talking about it, because the experience is so fresh in his mind and nothing about climate change and the prognosis there has really changed in the last year since he went to space. So that grief was still with him.\n\nHarris: How was his experience different from what he may have imagined that he would feel after going up to space?\n\nKoren: He told me that he expected to see Earth and just be reminded of how beautiful and wonderful this planet is. I think he expected it to be reaffirming in a positive way. And it\u2019s interesting to think of this man who played a character who was this really big space optimist in real life going to space, and his initial emotional reaction to that is grief and sadness and all kinds of negative emotion.\n\nI think what Shatner shares with other astronauts is: When people have gone to space, they have felt an overwhelming desire to take care of the planet. You really see that this is all there is. This is all we know, at least. And if this is our one home on this floating ball of rock in the void, then we should take care of it.\n\nAnd so, you know, there\u2019s a case to be made that the more people go up into space, that feeling will trickle down and lead to some type of meaningful improvement on Earth.\n\nHarris: If somebody gives you a ticket on a $20 million flight, you\u2019re not gonna be able to say, \u201cWell, that wasn\u2019t exactly what I expected it to be.\u201d But Shatner was able to do something different. Why was his experience different from others who have been up to space and came back down and just said, \u201cOh, it was great. Thanks, Jeff Bezos, for putting me on this flight\u201d?\n\nKoren: I mean, William Shatner is William Shatner, right? He was 90 years old during his space flight. He\u2019s Captain Kirk. I think he doesn\u2019t owe Jeff Bezos anything. Yes, Bezos comped his ticket, and that\u2019s lovely. But someone like William Shatner going into space can come back and say what they want, because the public looks at them in a different way. If a very wealthy person decides to comp the tickets for an electrician [or] for a nurse, and they go up and come down, can they speak their minds very freely? I don\u2019t know.\n\nHarris: Say a billionaire called you up and was like: \u201cHey, Marina, love your stories. You wanna go to space?\u201d Would you go if you got the opportunity?\n\nKoren: Oh man, well, there would be some conversation about journalistic ethics. But would I ever go to space? I\u2019m gonna say no.\n\nHarris: Really?\n\nKoren: Because spaceflight is risky. You never know what might happen, what could happen. I don\u2019t wanna die on the job not having filed my story. Like, if something happens\u2014if I\u2019m somehow incapacitated, I come back and I can\u2019t write the story\u2014that will haunt me. (Laughs.)\n\nPlanes freak me out. I still can\u2019t believe that we can get planes off the ground and land them back in one piece. And, you know, space is not at that level yet, but maybe someday it will be. And that\u2019s pretty wild to think about.\n\nHarris: Actually, to that point, thousands of people fly at high altitudes every day. Do you think that there\u2019s a future where spaceflight is going to feel as sort of commonplace as taking a flight to LaGuardia?\n\nKoren: I think that future is possible. I think what we have to be careful about is making too many promises. If you listen to Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos talk about spaceflight right now, they\u2019re suggesting that this future is happening, like, next week. And I don\u2019t think that future will happen that quickly. It\u2019s true that more people than before are going to have the opportunity to go to space now. I\u2019m not sure if in my lifetime there are going to be spaceships full of people going to the moon.\n\nI mean, there might be. SpaceX and Elon Musk are working really, really hard to make that future reality. SpaceX\u2019s next-generation moon rocket could reach orbit as early as next year. SpaceX has already sold tickets to people to go on a trip around the moon. These things are happening. How quickly they become reality, I don\u2019t know. Maybe 50 years from now when we\u2019re a hundred years out from the Apollo-program anniversary, maybe it will feel a bit more mundane, just like a plane ride.\n\nHarris: Is some of the mystique fading from space, or space travel? Are we sort of becoming desensitized to space travel? Those first couple of commercial flights, it was all 24-hour news cycle. They broadcast all of them. But that sort of slowed down. Are we sort of becoming desensitized to the awe and wonder of space travel?\n\nKoren: I think that\u2019s possible. I think of the Earthrise picture taken by the Apollo 8 crew in 1968. That picture was mind-blowing to people. They\u2019d never seen Earth like this before. Fifty years later, I think our brains are so spoiled by special effects that I do wonder if the sight of Earth from space is going to be that shocking. Especially when you have so many people going into orbit and coming back and posting on Instagram like: \u201cHere\u2019s what it looks like.\u201d I do wonder if we\u2019ve seen so much incredible CGI, if our modern brains might be less impressed by the view than maybe people were in the 1960s. But I also don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just some dumb Millennial take.\n\nHarris: It\u2019s like if somebody goes up, and they\u2019re like: \u201cThis isn\u2019t what Interstellar looked like.\u201d\n\nKoren: (Laughs.) \u201cWhere\u2019s the wormhole?\u201d\n\nHarris: \u201cI was expecting a wormhole.\u201d And all they see is, as Shatner said, this great blackness of space.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "It was Warren Buffett's year of joy and sadness in 2022. Omaha's Oracle saw his Berkshire Hathaway Group exceed the S&P 500 index for the first time in six years, placing it among the world's third richest people, but he watched helplessly as Berkshire's share price fell and the pandemic persisted. But Buffett remains his usual self-speaker. The billionaire investor has spent much of his time offering colorful quotes on a variety of topics, from stock market gambling to Bitcoin, and his admiration for Tesla's Elon Musk and Amazon's Jeff Bezos. So, here's a review of Warren Buffett's top 10 quotes for 2022: On stock market gambling: \"You know, if you have the ability to stay rational and be able to see long-term results, then the stock market is a good place to go. But for gamblers, it's a terrible place where most people don't have the discipline to get away from it.\" On Bitcoin: \"It's basically an illusion. In terms of cryptocurrencies, generally speaking, I can almost say with certainty that they will have a bad ending.\" About Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos: \"These two incredible people (Musk and Bezos) have done a tremendous job... they've disrupted the industry once and for all, not yet stopped.\" On investing: \"No matter how great a talent or effort, there are things that take time. You can't have a baby in one month and get nine women pregnant.\" On Berkshire's stock price: \"The stock market is a never-ending story between buyers and sellers, it has no conscience. Its job is to make sure that all of us - except insiders - feel as uncertain as possible.\" With regard to reinvestment: \"The stocks we tend to sell are those that have consistently performed better than I wanted to own, and I think they're overvalued or undervalued. A truly low-price company should be left alone - not sold - so the market can eventually recognize its true value.\" 7. With regard to the development of Berkshire: \" Berkshire has grown larger, and is likely to grow more; this size brings great advantages in some areas but also significant disadvantages in others. But scale will not be our waste; our dislike of leverage, fashion and high-price investments will become a reality.\" On the future: \"Someone is sitting in the shade today, because a long time ago someone planted a tree. 9. On humility: \"If you don't feel like you're questioning your opinions and trying to find out the flaws in them, you're not thinking. We always look for reasons not to do something.\" 10. About excessive self-confidence: \"You always have to be prepared for the unexpected. Overself-confidence kills\" Buffett's words of wisdom never cease to inspire investors and ordinary people. His frank insights and humor are fresh, especially in an incomprehensible world. Let us keep his words in mind and apply them to our lives for the coming year.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The Tennessee Titans had some big news for the 17th week as they prepared to face the Jacksonville Jaguars on the playoff line. According to reports, the Titans have decided to switch in the quarterback with Joshua Dobbs replacing struggling Malik Willis. The Titans, who won the AFC South Division with a record 10-5 and secured the playoff title, have been riding Willis' arm in recent weeks, leading them 5-3 in the last eight games. Willis has been hot during that time, but the Titans feel they need something different as they prepare to face the Jaguars in their key game of week 17. As a result, the Titans decided to turn to Dobbs, who are more experienced than Willis. Dobbs was the fourth-round pick from Tennessee in the 2017 NFL draft and has been working for the Pittsburgh Steelers for the past three seasons with Ben Roethlisberger as his main defender. Dobbs has been in the NFL for four years with only 12 regular season passes, so it's a big risk for the Titans. But if they want to go deep into the playoffs this season, they obviously feel the need for a new quarterback voice. The Titans had an excellent defense and a strong game, so Dobbs didn't have to do much to get Tennessee to win the game. But he did need to deal effectively with the ball because the Titans couldn't afford to turn the ball over to the Jaguars for an easy chance of scoring. The Titans' decision to start Dobbs would certainly make them a more interesting team, moving into week 17. The Jaguars have their own big decisions in the quarterback position, because they haven't decided yet whether Gardner Minshew or Jake Luton will be fourth-back. No matter which quarterback wins, there is a chance to lead the Jaguars to a huge victory and take the AFC South title from Titan. But with Dobbs now in charge, it will be interesting to see how he copes with the pressure of such a big game. The Titans have made it clear that they believe in his abilities, so we must see if he can live up to expectations. The Titans hope that Dobbs will lead them to win the playoff and get a place, but only time will tell whether his new role will produce the desired results.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Christian Lawrence, 29, is one of Business Insider's Rising Stars of Real Estate for 2022.\n\nIn 2 years, he's built Rise Modular into a company with 150 employees and over 400 units under construction.\n\nModular construction can make housing more affordable by delivering units at a lower cost, he says.\n\nTop editors give you the stories you want \u2014 delivered right to your inbox each weekday. Loading Something is loading. Thanks for signing up! Access your favorite topics in a personalized feed while you're on the go. download the app Email address By clicking \u2018Sign up\u2019, you agree to receive marketing emails from Insider as well as other partner offers and accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nThe process for building affordable multifamily housing in the US is broken, and modular construction might just be the way to fix it, says Christian Lawrence, 29, a CEO of Rise Modular, a construction company in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nModular construction refers to a process of building a residence at an off-site location and then assembling all of the pieces on-site, almost like LEGO pieces. At Rise, which specializes in multi-story and commercial real estate construction, this can mean building an entire floor of a home or apartment \u2014 including kitchens, bathrooms, and appliances \u2014 at its 150,000-square-foot warehouse and then transporting it to a job site for installation.\n\nBuilding homes off-site can help speed up the time it takes to complete homes in areas of the country that face extreme weather, Lawrence said, as the initial construction process takes place inside and away from the elements. It's also more efficient in the sense that workers build the homes in an assembly line approach versus starting from scratch at each job site. Economies of scale not only reduce material costs, but they can also reduce waste generated during construction, Lawrence added.\n\nIn just two and a half years, Lawrence has grown Rise Modular into a business that has completed more than 760 housing units as of November 2022. Rise has also grown to 150 employees and has another 400 units currently under construction.\n\n\"We need to find a better way to build housing for everyone,\" Lawrence told Insider in November. \"Everyone acknowledges the challenges we have as it concerns high construction costs, and I think modular construction is one of the most innovative and sustainable solutions we have.\"\n\nRise Modular primarily focuses on developments like student housing, hotels, and apartment buildings, Lawrence said. The company has also been called upon by other developers to help finish projects that wouldn't otherwise be possible in a more traditional construction setting, Lawrence added.\n\nFor example, Rise helped complete a seven-story, 192-unit apartment building called Alvera Apartments in St. Paul in December 2021, according to the company's website. Lawrence said other developers on the project approached Rise to help with the project because they couldn't make the numbers work with a conventional construction company. Rise was able to complete the building with 154 different modular pieces which saved at least five months of construction work, Lawrence added.\n\nThe impact of modular construction can also be seen outside of construction sites, Lawrence said, because it can make housing more affordable for renters at a time when wages are stagnant due to inflation. For instance, rents for studio and one-bedroom apartments at Alvera start at around $940 and $1,375 per month, respectively, according to the building's website.\n\nThe studio unit shaves off nearly $300 per month compared to the median rent for a studio apartment in Minneapolis while the one-bedroom apartment is about $200 less than the median, according to data from ApartmentList.com.\n\n\"Modular construction has the potential to provide housing at a lower cost and deliver buildings in a more cost-effective way than traditional sticks-and-bricks construction,\" Lawrence said. \"It can also deliver a higher quality and more environmentally sustainable product.\"\n\nThese apartments are also hitting the market at a time when real wages in Minneapolis are decreasing because of inflation. According to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, wages in construction and professional services have increased by 5% as of November 2022. However, consumer price data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that inflation reached 5.3% in November, meaning that workers saw the spending power of their wages decrease by 0.3% over the last year.\n\nIn the next three to five years, Lawrence said he expects Rise to become a leader in the modular construction space. The process has been used successfully for decades in Europe, but Lawrence said there are very few companies in the US who are up to the challenge, especially in the Midwest where cold winters and snow can grind construction to a halt.\n\n\"We've proved that there are real cost and time savings associated with modular construction,\" Lawrence said", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Insider asked creator economy industry professionals to share their predictions for 2023.\n\nTheir predictions include more Gen X and millennial creators, and startups closing their doors.\n\nSee which trends to watch for in 2023 below.\n\n2023 will be an adjustment year for the creator economy as it adapts to fears of a recession and to the potential consequences of an economic downturn.\n\nSome influencers began developing strategies to stay afloat well before 2023. Creators and managers told Insider in November that business could take a hit if cash-strapped advertisers become pickier about who they sponsor.\n\nPamela Zapata, the CEO of talent-management firm Society18, told Insider that she is preparing for 2023 by looking to diversify her firm's offerings beyond influencer management, and expanding into helping brands execute deals.\n\nBut even with an impending downturn, social-media usage is still expected to rise. Insider Intelligence expects nearly 70% of Gen Z to use TikTok monthly in 2023, up from 64% in 2022.\n\nWe spoke with investors, influencer marketers, and industry experts, who shared their best predictions for the creator economy in 2023.\n\nThey expect to see more Gen X and millennial creators, more influencers who identify as YouTubers, and a shakeup in the startup sphere.\n\n1. More creators \u2014 and more generations \u2014 will join the industry\n\nShannae Ingleton Smith, cofounder of talent-management firm Kensington Grey, predicted that TikTok would attract more Gen X and millennial creators as the platform continues to grow and expand in 2023.\n\n\"Gen Z will definitely continue to shine and continue to have their moment, but we are going to start to see some really huge rising stars that were not ever successful or big on Instagram or YouTube previously that will start from scratch on TikTok and become super-star huge,\" Ingleton Smith said.\n\nShe's recently seen people like the actress Julia Fox talk about \"the glamorization of aging\" as a new TikTok trend, for example.\n\nYouTube; Rachel Mendelson/Insider\n\nYouTube, in particular, could see a new wave of creators.\n\n\"In 2023, I think we're going to see a record number of creators identify as YouTubers for the first time,\" said Lia Haberman, adjunct marketing professor at UCLA Extension. \"Shorts lowered the barrier to entry for creators who never saw themselves as part of that ecosystem and the addition of AdSense payouts for short-form videos makes the platform so much more appealing. For professional creators, YouTube is currently the best bet for a sustainable income through predictable content distribution.\"\n\nZack Honarvar, founder of talent-management firm One Day Entertainment, predicted that more creators would hire larger production and business-development teams. He also said he believes that there will be a nostalgic return to \"old\" YouTube formats like vlogging, and that content will become more global, such as dubbed videos in foreign markets.\n\nNon-US creators could also become more popular in 2023, said Josh Glodoveza, VP of talent at merch company Fanjoy.\n\n\"With technology being more available in the next few years in different countries, we're going to see a more global idea of a creator,\" he said.\n\n2. Creators will expand their content beyond photos and short-form video\n\nDarren Lachtman, cofounder of digital-production company Brat, predicted creators would continue to expand into podcasts as they look to grow their audiences across multiple platforms.\n\n\"We will continue to see the evolution from just pure audio into more 'vodcast' productions as creators blend audio and video,\" he wrote to Insider. \"This format allows creators to post the same content across various platforms.\"\n\nMore creators may also develop strategies for livestreaming in 2023, predicted Christen Nino De Guzman, founder of startup Clara.\n\n\"When I worked at TikTok, livestreaming was huge for the Chinese version of TikTok, and they tended to see many trends originate first in China and the US would follow shortly after,\" she said.\n\nWitthaya Prasongsin/Getty Images\n\nSimilarly, Haberman thinks that there will be more education around helping platforms, retailers, marketers, and creators find new ways to connect with audiences and get more potential customers into the funnel, especially when it comes to livestreaming.\n\nLivetreaming takes a different set of skills and talent than \"staging the perfect photo op or storyboarding a 20-second video clip,\" she said.\n\nBut creators who develop those skills may be able to hold audiences' attentions for longer.\n\n\"Creators who can be on live for hours at a time are going to start doing really well, because it's more than just scrolling through content,\" said Julian Andrew, founder of the influencer talent-management firm Talentiish. \"People want more long-form content, so just keeping someone's attention on live will become a trend in 2023.\"\n\n3. Live shopping could finally have its moment in the US\n\nIndustry insiders may have been premature in declaring 2022 the year of social and live shopping.\n\nWhile a number of social-media platforms launched new shopping features, some platforms like Meta and TikTok reevaluated their plays in this space. Live-shopping startups, such as Popshop Live, have also had to cut costs as the market soured in 2022.\n\n2023 could be different, though.\n\nViral Nation cofounder Joe Gagliese said he thinks that the market is bound to grow, citing how live shopping was a $300 billion market in China as of 2021 (according to Insider Intelligence data).\n\n\"Both people and brands have come to realize that streaming not only serves for entertainment, but creates profit as well,\" he said.\n\nAdoption in the US market may be an uphill battle, however.\n\nInsider Intelligence found that US customers have been slow to adopt live shopping and other social commerce methods. According to an October survey by Insider Intelligence, 43% of US adults said that they \"have neither engaged in livestream commerce nor are interested in doing so.\"\n\neMarketer/Insider Intelligence\n\nBut broader social commerce could have a moment as more and more people make purchases via platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.\n\n\"The creator-guided shopping experience will become the preferred way to shop for more people because it's efficient in saving time and money and more personalized,\" said Amber Venz Box, cofounder and president of the shopping app LTK.\n\n4. Some creator economy startups might close their doors\n\nIn 2022, layoffs were rampant in the creator economy, as companies like Patreon and Jellysmack reacted to the economic slowdown by letting employees go. Nick Chen, cofounder of creator-monetization startup Pico, said that the negative impacts on startups will not only continue in 2023, but could become worse.\n\n\"A lot of creator startups are going to die\" in 2023, he said. \"Venture capitalists think this isn't the time to be betting on the creator economy, so the next nine months will be really tough.\"\n\nSince many startups came into the space at the height of the pandemic, Chen thinks that some will run out of money in the next three to six months, especially because venture-capital funding has been more difficult to come by this year compared to 2020 and 2021. As a result, some startups running low on cash could decide to close their doors permanently.\n\nQianna Smith Bruneteau, founder of the American Influencer Council, said she believes that some creator startups will have a tough time surviving.\n\n\"Many of them will fail because they raised at insane valuations that they can't keep up with, and a lot of them struggle to acquire a user base,\" she said.\n\nRachel Mendelson/Insider\n\nSeveral experts pointed to the link-in-bio space as one category where doors could shutter. Cynthia Ruff, creator and founder of Hashtag Pay Me, said that she wouldn't be surprised if the space \"lost 10 link-in-bio companies\" in 2023.\n\nHowever, Chen predicts that the economy might pick back up in Q4 2023, at which time startups that are still around could replenish their purses.\n\n\"I think we'll recover by Labor Day, if startups can wait until then to fundraise,\" Chen said.\n\n5. Meanwhile, there could be an M&A frenzy on the horizon\n\nAs a result of the tougher macroeconomic environment, a looming recession, and a funding chill, the startup space could experience a wave of dealmaking and consolidation.\n\n\"Depressed valuations and multiples mean that most acquisition targets are effectively 'on sale,'\" said Alex Zirin, an associate at consulting firm RockWater Industries. \"As a result, institutional acquirers, like private-equity firms who still have dry powder to spend, will start snatching up mid-to-large sized creator startups at much more advantageous prices.\"\n\nHeading into 2023, industry experts are eyeing saturated niches within the creator economy, such as link-in-bio companies or fintech solutions for creators.\n\n\"From the creator's end, there's just so many choices,\" said Avi Gandhi, founder of the advisory firm Partner with Creators. \"The odds that they're going to pick your service \u2014 or any given service \u2014 are suddenly exponentially lower, and sometimes they're not even picking a service because it's overwhelming.\"\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misstated the title of Josh Glodoveza.

{"text": ".. Australia's top health adviser has warned the federal government against imposing further travel restrictions on tourists from China as the country struggles to cope with an increasingly severe coronavirus outbreak in its largest city. Australia recorded the highest number of new Covid-19 cases in four weeks, raising concerns about a second wave of the virus. Australia's chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, said in a statement released Saturday that he believes any further restrictions on travel from China to Australia could have unintended consequences. \"If we impose travel restrictions and people will continue to travel and bypass them, we have no control over this situation,\" Kelly said. \"It is important that we protect Australians by strengthening quarantine procedures and supporting those returning from areas of concern, rather than further restricting travel from certain parts of the world.\" The warning comes at a time when Australia is facing an increasingly severe coronavirus outbreak in its largest city, Melbourne. As of Sunday, Melbourne has recorded 722 new Covid-19 cases in the past seven days, the highest daily count since the start of the pandemic. The Victorian state government has imposed stricter restrictions on movement, including a curfew from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. and a ban on visiting family and friends at home. So far, however, the Australian Government has resisted calls to impose a similar blockade on other parts of Australia. Meanwhile, to curb the spread of the virus in Victoria, the state government imposed travel restrictions on people from abroad, requiring anyone arriving in Australia to spend two weeks in a designated hotel isolation zone. The Australian Health Protection Main Committee said it did not support extending the hotel quarantine program to people from all international destinations. The commission said that while the risk of imported coronavirus cases remains low, hotel quarantine programs are \"too heavy and expensive\" and may not have a lasting impact on community transmission. \"While the risk of imported cases is low, the risk may change rapidly as international, national or local circumstances change,\" the panel said in a statement. Despite warnings from health groups, the federal government has not ruled out further travel restrictions for travellers from China and other countries with high Covid-19 transmission rates. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has previously said he favors reducing the number of people coming in from abroad. \"We want to make sure that we can control who enters and leaves this country with the best of our ability,\" he said at a news conference on Saturday. However, health experts warn that Australia needs to be careful not to rely too much on travel restrictions to manage the coronavirus, but instead to focus on other measures such as increased detection, contact tracking and appropriate isolation. \"It's important that we focus on reducing Covid-19 transmission in Australia through public health measures, not just relying on travel restrictions,\" said Professor Mary-Louise McLaws, an infectious disease specialist at the University of New South Wales. \"The biggest risk for Australia is not being able to identify travellers from high-risk areas and allowing the virus to spread within communities.", "label": "machine"}

Musk said during the event that he plans to get one of the implants himself.\n\nMusk said two of the company's applications will aim to restore vision, even for people who were born blind, and a third application will focus on the motor cortex, restoring \"full body functionality\" for people with severed spinal cords. \"We're confident there are no physical limitations to restoring full body functionality,\" Musk said.\n\nNeuralink could begin to test the motor cortex technology in humans in as soon as six months, Musk said.\n\n\"Obviously, we want to be extremely careful and certain that it will work well before putting a device in a human, but we're submitted, I think, most of our paperwork to the FDA,\" he said.\n\nMusk also said he plans to get one himself. \"You could have a Neuralink device implanted right now and you wouldn't even know. I mean, hypothetically ... In fact, in one of these demos, I will,\" he said. He reiterated that on Twitter after the event.\n\nSince none of Neuralink's devices have been tested on humans or approved by the FDA, Wednesday's announcements warrant skepticism, said Xing Chen, assistant professor in the Department of Ophthalmology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.\n\n\"Neuralink is a company [that] doesn't have to answer to shareholders,\" she told CNBC. \"I don't know how much oversight is involved, but I think it's very important for the public to always keep in mind that before anything has been approved by the FDA, or any governmental regulatory body, all claims need to be very, very skeptically examined.\"\n\nNeuralink was founded in 2016 by Musk and a group of other scientists and engineers. It strives to develop brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs, that connect the human brain to computers that can decipher neural signals.\n\nMusk invested tens of millions of his personal wealth into the company and has said, without evidence, that Neuralink's devices could enable \"superhuman cognition,\" enable paralyzed people to operate smartphones or robotic limbs with their minds someday, and \"solve\" autism and schizophrenia.\n\nThe company's presentation Wednesday echoed these lofty ambitions, as Musk claimed that \"as miraculous as it may sound, we're confident that it is possible to restore full body functionality to someone who has a severed spinal cord.\"\n\nMusk showed footage of a monkey with a computer chip in its skull playing \"telepathic video games,\" which Neuralink first debuted over a year ago. The billionaire, who is also the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and the new owner of Twitter, said at the time that he wants to implant Neuralink chips into quadriplegics who have brain or spinal injuries so that they can \"control a computer mouse, or their phone, or really any device just by thinking.\"\n\nNeuralink has come under fire for its alleged treatment of monkeys, and the Physician's Committee for Responsible Medicine on Wednesday called on Musk to release details about experiments on monkeys that had resulted in internal bleeding, paralysis, chronic infections, seizures, declining psychological health and death.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "George Santos, a former executive at a large pharmaceutical company, was again accused of lying about his personal background and educational history, this time with new details about his family history and previous employment. Santos suddenly resigned from his job in November after an explosive New York Times report on false claims emerged and is now being summoned by former colleagues and public interest groups to make false allegations about his family history and education. Controversy surrounding Santos has been on the rise since his resignation, accusing him of making false statements about his background and education while allegedly hiding the truth about his work and family history. Now, a new report from the nonprofit watchdog ProPublica reveals more false allegations made by Santos, who still faces criminal investigations related to his previous job. The ProPublica report shows that Santos, who has long claimed to have a PhD in the pharmaceutical industry and a long family history, actually lied about both things. According to the report, Santos holds only a bachelor's degree from one online school. He also claims to have worked for pharmacist Pfizer for nearly 25 years, but public records show that he actually spent only three months there. In addition, the report revealed that Santos tried to cover up the fact that his family had no history in the pharmaceutical industry and that he did not grow up in the Bronx as he claimed. In response to the ProPublica report, pharmacist Pfizer said in a statement: \"We take any and all allegations of fraud and misstatement of employment history and family history very seriously.\" The controversy surrounding Santos has only grown in recent weeks, calling for an investigation into his previous claims and potential criminal charges. According to one of Santos' former colleagues, who spoke with The New York Times on condition of anonymity, Santos has been trying to decorate his background and qualifications. The Times reported that Santos was a major manipulator who would \"make stories about himself\" such as claiming to be a millionaire, owning luxury cars and having connections with celebrities. Santos previously denied that he had lied about his background, and his lawyer said the charges against him were \"unfounded and untrue\". Despite his denial, the criminal investigation into Santos is still ongoing and it seems likely that more false statements about his background and employment will emerge. At the same time, many have questioned how someone like Santos could rise to the top of a large pharmaceutical company because he provided false information about himself. These findings raise questions about the process by which large companies evaluate executive leadership, and whether there are safeguards in place to ensure that potential leaders are accurately and honestly represented. George Santos' case is a warning story that raises important questions about how companies evaluate potential leaders, and highlights the need for transparency when selecting executives.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Members of Congress say there will be more regulation going into social media platforms in 2023. In a joint press conference, representatives of both parties in the House of Representatives said that given the growing number of online abuses, it is time to enact new laws to protect users. \"Companies like Facebook and Twitter can no longer take advantage of their enormous influence without being held accountable for their actions,\" said Adam Schiff, a California representative. \"We need to take steps to protect users and ensure that these companies are no longer able to profit from the spread of misinformation and hate speech.\" Delegates say social media platforms have become too powerful and need to be held accountable for their content. \"The number of abuses and hate speech on social media has increased dramatically over the past few years,\" said Ted Budd, R-N.C. representative. \"We've also seen an increase in disinformation spread across these platforms. That's why it's time to take action and start holding those companies accountable for what they publish.\" Delegates pointed out that any new regulations must be carefully drafted to ensure that the platform remains free and open to users. \"The last thing we want to do is stifle free speech, but we also have to make sure that these companies are responsible for what they advertise,\" said Ro Khanna, a California representative. Delegates say new legislation is needed in the coming months to address these issues, which will seek to combat online abuse and hate speech, and require social media companies to be more transparent about their algorithms and advertising practices. \"The days when these companies were able to use their vast influence without any consequences have passed,\" said Jim Langevin, D-R.I.'s representative, adding: \"Now is the time for Congress to act and I look forward to introducing legislation soon.\" This is not the first time that Congress has introduced new regulations for social media companies. In 2021, several lawmakers proposed a bill that would create a new federal agency to oversee these companies and ensure they take the necessary steps to protect their users. Now, Congress seems to be thinking more seriously about regulating social media companies. Clearly, lawmakers on both sides are ready to take action and enact new laws to protect users and ensure that companies are held accountable for their actions.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "But what many parents don't realize is that seemingly harmless toys can also be breeding grounds. A new study published in the Journal of Pediatrics found that nearly a third of home toys contain enough bacteria and viruses to put children at risk for infectious diseases - even more than those on public toilet seats. What's the dirtyest toy in your home? what do you do? The Most Contaminated Toys Pediatric studies have found that rubber balls - one of the most popular toys for children, usually given as birthday gifts - are often the dirtyest items in the home. Other popular toys, such as stuffed animals and action figures, can also be very reproductive, with some samples carrying more than 100 times the amount of bacteria found on public toilet seats. The study also showed that some toys in contact with the mouth, such as dolls, soothing agents and toothpastes, may contain large amounts of bacteria, such as venereal chiropraxia aureus and pseudo-Mona Aeruginosa, as well as viruses such as common colds and flu. Why are toys so dirty? Experts believe that toys are so heavily contaminated because they are often treated by children, who have notoriously imperfect hygiene practices and play in areas that aren't always clean. Moreover, rubber toys are particularly vulnerable to bacterial damage due to their porousness, which means that bacteria and viruses can easily hide in the cracks of toys and are difficult to remove. How to Clean Children's Toys So, how can parents keep their children's toys clean? According to experts, the most important thing is to regularly check these toys and discard any in poor condition. Some toys can be simply wiped off with soap wetcloth or disinfectant, while others may need to be immersed in soap warm water or boiled. It is best to rotate the toys in order to prevent contamination, and put all the toys in one room for easier monitoring. Finally, be sure to wash your child's hands regularly, emphasizing the importance of not sharing toys with other children. What toys should I throw away? Although regular cleaning can reduce the spread of bacteria, some toys are too dirty and should be thrown away forever. Here are 8 most polluted toys you should consider throwing away: Hairy animals: One of the most beloved children's toys, feathered animals are found to have higher levels of bacteria and viruses than most other toys. If the animal is obviously dirty, tearing or has loose fur, it is best to throw it away. 2. Rubber ball: Pediatric studies have found that rubber balls are the most dirty household toys. Replace the rubber ball every few months to keep the bacteria safe. Fire retardants: Experts recommend that after several months of use, the flame retardant should be discarded and replaced with a new flame retardant. Motion numbers: Action numbers usually contain more bacteria than other toys, and should be washed away or discarded if soiled excessively. Dolls: dolls can contain high levels of bacteria and viruses, and if they become too dirty, they should be cleaned and replaced regularly. Teeth: The teeth placed in the child's mouth should be washed after each use, and replaced every few months. Plastic toys: plastic toys are particularly vulnerable to the effects of bacteria, so it is important to wipe them regularly with a wet cloth and disinfectant. 8.Player and foam block: Player and foam block can also collect bacteria, should be regularly cleaned with soap wetcloth or disinfectant. II. Conclusions Parents can reduce the risk of contamination by regularly checking and cleaning their children's toys and discarding any toys that are too dirty. First, parents should emphasize good hygiene practices for their children to ensure they do not put themselves at risk of disease.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Navigating relationships in the workplace can be a tricky minefield - especially when you say something to your boss. Slipping your tongue or making inappropriate comments will not only make you look bad, but also damage your relationship with your boss. So to help, we've sorted out what you shouldn't say to your boss, and better options. 1. 'Sorry, this is not my job' Your boss will appreciate it even more if you help. \"I'll be happy to help you find a better solution to this problem\" or \"Let me see what I can do\" are both polite and respectful phrases that can get the job done without your boss being on the spot. \"Yesterday you told me to do it.\" Using the phrase \"you tell me\" can be said to be confrontational and imply that your boss is contradicting himself. If your boss has changed plans, it's best to stay positive and professional. A better phrase might be, \"I've started the task, but would it be better if I kept doing something else?\" 3. \"This doesn't work\" Instead of criticizing the boss's ideas, it is better to offer alternatives. \"What if we try to do this?\" is a simple and effective phrase that shows your boss that you're willing to work with him or her to find a better solution. 4. \"I've done it already\" If your boss is repeating a task you've already done, it's best to thank them for the opportunity to take on additional responsibilities. Instead of reminding your boss that you've completed the task, say \"I'm happy to do it again. It's been a great learning experience.\" 5. \"It's not fair\" Your boss may have a reason to assign tasks - complain that it won't do you any good. If you feel underwork or overworked, don't point to it. Phrases like \"I want to make sure I use my time effectively and take the right project\" can do this work without triggering any drama. 6. \"I can't do that\" No one can do anything, but using this phrase might make your boss think you're not cooperating or disobedient. Therefore, it's best to limit what you can do, for example, \"I can help you solve this problem, but I may need some help with that.\" 7. \"It's not my fault.\" Don't make excuses, take responsibility for your actions. \"I made a mistake. How can I get it right?\" will show your boss that you're willing to learn from your mistakes and grow into an employee. 8. \"It's not possible.\" This sentence is frustrating, meaning that you're not willing to think outside the box. To avoid this, try using the phrase: \"It may be a tough challenge but I'm willing to accept it.\" 9. \"I don't know\" It's admirable to have the courage to admit that you're not sure - but if your boss is looking for a solution, you need to make some suggestions. Instead of simply admitting that you don't know, say something like, \"I'm not entirely sure, but I think it might be a possible solution.\" 10. \"This is not my first task\" When your boss assigns tasks, he or she may not know all of your other responsibilities. Instead of rejecting a request, prioritize it. For example, \"I'm focusing on this project now, but I can put it at the top of the list.\" 10. \"It's stupid\" It is best to avoid using any derogatory language in the workplace. Instead, you might suggest, \"Maybe we should look at the problem from another perspective\" or \"Let me think about it and come up with a solution.\" 12. \"I was drowning.\" Your boss might sympathize with the fact that you feel overwhelmed, but expressing it may be unprofessional.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "In a landmark ruling, the South Carolina Supreme Court on Thursday lifted its six-week abortion ban, upheld privacy protections under the state's constitution and rejected efforts by the state legislature to limit access to abortion. The 6-0 ruling is a victory for abortion rights advocates who believe South Carolina's law passed in 2019 will effectively ban abortion in the state, as many women do not know they are pregnant until six weeks later. The law, known as the \"Pregnancy Age Ban,\" has been challenged by a coalition of abortion providers and advocates who argue it violates South Carolina's constitutional right to privacy and the state's commitment to reproductive freedom. The court's ruling goes beyond South Carolina's specific case and could set a legal precedent that would make it difficult for other states to pass similar laws limiting abortion opportunities. \"This is a major victory for the right to privacy and reproductive freedom, not just in South Carolina but across the country,\" said Dr. William C. Bell, CEO of the South Atlantic Planned Parenthood Organization (SFP), in a statement. \"The Court's decision reaffirms Roe v. Wade's commitment as well as the fundamental principle that women have the right to make their own decisions on reproductive health without interference from politicians.\" At the heart of the case is a 2015 South Carolina law that banned abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy unless it was necessary to save the mother's life. The ban has been challenged by family planning and other abortion rights advocates, who consider it unconstitutional. The South Carolina Supreme Court agreed with these arguments, ruling that the law violated the state's commitment to protecting women's reproductive privacy. \"This court has a constitutional obligation to recognize and protect the right to privacy inherent in all individual liberties,\" Judge Kaye Hearn wrote, in her opinion. \"The reproductive right to privacy is deeply rooted in our nation's tradition of respecting individual autonomy and self-determination, as well as its Constitution's guarantee of personal freedom.\" The ruling was welcomed by abortion rights advocates, who in recent years have seen similar laws banning abortion after six weeks - the \"fetal survival\" tip - in Alabama, Louisiana, and Georgia. These laws are currently blocked by courts, but many fear a conservative Supreme Court could eventually overturn Roe v. Wade's landmark decision to legalise abortion. South Carolina's ruling could provide abortion rights advocates with additional legal ammunition to challenge similar laws in other states. \"This ruling affirms that women must have the freedom to decide their own bodies and pregnancies, free from political interference,\" said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights in a statement. \"It is a powerful reminder that courts remain a key bulwark against laws aimed at restricting access to reproductive health services and making abortion impossible.\" Thursday's ruling also underscored the importance of judicial appointments, as South Carolina's Supreme Court can only issue this ruling because it was recently backed by two new judges' appointments. The court currently has five judges appointed by the Democratic governor, ensuring that the state's Supreme Court continues to firmly support abortion rights for the foreseeable future. The ruling is a major victory for women's rights in South Carolina, where the legislature has been pushing tougher abortion policies for years. But it could also be controversial nationwide, providing legal precedent for other states to follow suit, and reminding politicians that women's choices remain protected.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The NCAA is reportedly investigating potential violations by the University of Michigan and its head coach, Jim Harbaugh. According to sources, the NCAA has conducted months of investigations into the university and is investigating allegations that the school did not follow the necessary rules in terms of recruitment and other off-site activities. The NCAA is reportedly investigating allegations that schools have been providing unacceptable benefits for the future, including inappropriate accommodation and transportation, access to private training and coaching, and preferential treatment for players. The NCAA is also investigating the school's recruitment strategy, including whether it has been providing potential customers with unacceptable benefits. The NCAA has yet to comment on the investigation, and there are no official statements from Michigan or Hubble. Michigan, one of the nation's top college football programs, is ushering in a successful season with them winning 10 games and reaching the Orange Cup. Harbaugh has entered his sixth season under the leadership of the program, while Wolverine are recognized as the top ten teams for the 2020 season. This isn't the first time Michigan and Hubble have been linked to potential NCAA violations. Back in 2016, the school was hit by a one-year ban, scholarship cuts and other penalties for violating NCAA rules on academic misconduct and recruiting foreign student athletes. Hubbard denied any knowledge of the violations and said he was unaware of his staff's actions at the time. The NCAA can take a variety of actions to deal with violations, including reducing scholarships, suspending or even postseason bans. Michigan has already felt the impact of the investigation, as the university recently withdrew from its Florida recruitment campaign due to an NCAA investigation. The investigation could also have serious implications for Hubble and Michigan's football program. If the NCAA determines that he has violated any rules, Hubbard may face suspension or even dismissal. This is not the first time Michigan and Hubble have been investigated by the NCAA. In the past, the NCAA has imposed sanctions for various violations in Michigan, including academic misconduct on football programs and coaching programs that provide players with academic benefits. The NCAA's investigation into Michigan and Hubble may take months to complete, and they could face severe sanctions if universities and head coaches are found guilty of any wrongdoing. It is not clear how this inquiry will affect Michigan's place in college football or how it will affect Hubble's future at school.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Score and statistics. A highly anticipated match between the Horn Frogs of Texas Christian University (TCU) and the Wolves of Michigan reached its high profile, with the TCU winning 51-45. The game was a typical Big 12 versus Big 10 battle where the TCU took predominance in terms of attack while the Michigans brought their physical defense to the negotiating table. That would set the tone for the rest of the game, as TCU will continue to move the ball onto the pitch with relative ease. Woolflin's defense had its great moments, home guard Desmond Morgan and safety Raymon Taylor performing well, but ultimately not enough to stop the TCU from attacking. As the game progresses, Michigan's attack will struggle to find its footing against a stubborn TCU defense. Woolverin's battle proved their overwhelming 221 overall offensive sites. The Yellow Eagle Frog will play two more games in the fourth quarter to make it difficult to reach. The last one was played with a 19-yard pass from quarterback Trevone Boykin to Broadband receiver LaDarius Brown, which prompted the TCU to win 51 against 45. Boykin played for Pachall in the fourth quarter, finishing 15-20 with three ground counterattacks without interception. The top recipient of the TCU was Josh Doctson, who made six 94-yard captures and two ground counterattacks. For Michigan, the highlight was Robinson, who made a solid performance despite his beatings. The senior QB passed 24 to 37 at 313 yards, ending the game with two touchdowns and two interceptions. The Wolverin's main shooter was Senior RB Fitzgerald Toussaint, who had 76 yards on 19 shots and one touchdown. In general, the TCU's defense was able to stop Michigan's relentless attack, while their offensive surpassed and outperformed the Wolves. This was a huge victory for the TCU, and also put them in a good position to compete for the 12th crown. As for Michigan, they will have to look for answers during the off-season and seek a bounce back in 2014.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "The U.S. economy is entering a rough patch as brand companies, many of which have resisted the Great Recession so far, announce staggering levels of white collar layoffs. Just last week, Uber, IBM, Microsoft, Apple and McDonald's all joined the redundancies. The news has been troubling many, as the workforce remains particularly vulnerable amid economic uncertainty over the coronavirus epidemic. For companies, the slowdown means a sober adjustment of labor. As revenues decline and demand for goods and services decreases, companies must adjust costs to stay viable. As unemployment soars, affected workers face an uncertain future. Some are struggling to normalize their finances, while others may be forced to change career paths. Uber, which began cutting jobs this week, is among the companies that have announced the largest number of layoffs since the outbreak of the Coronavirus. The ride-sharing company cited \"adjusting its organization to better serve passengers and drivers\" as the reason behind the cuts, which will affect about 3,000 employees. IBM says it will cut as many as 10,000 jobs globally, with much of the loss going to be in the US and India, the two companies' biggest markets. Microsoft, the world's largest software manufacturer, has also laid off up to 5,000 people because of the epidemic. Meanwhile, McDonald's has announced that it will lay off 3,500 jobs in its corporate offices, although it did not specify how many of those positions were business cuts. The tech giant Apple is laying off 11,000 jobs at retail stores in 30 countries due to declining consumer spending. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 10.7 million jobs have been lost since the outbreak of the coronavirus in March 2020, with the most affected sectors including hospitality, retail and leisure. While some industries are recruiting workers, others are still struggling. Businesses are shrinking and cutting jobs as they try to cope with a sudden downturn. Unemployment can have long-term effects. In addition to direct impacts, economists say job cuts could lead to a layering effect that creates a ripple of economic pain across the economy. As consumer confidence continued to decline, layoffs followed. According to the Conference Board of Industry Research Organizations, consumer confidence in December fell to its lowest level in four years, reaching a nine-year low that month. The spiral drop in job cuts and consumer spending has left analysts worried that the economy will continue to slow down in the near future. In addition to white collar layoffs, the company has also begun its own austerity measures, such as freezing wages and reducing working hours, in order to save costs. Despite some signs of economic recovery, the wave of white-collar layoffs paint a worrying picture for the future. As the economic outlook remains uncertain, pressure on companies to survive will only grow.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".. The Roman Catholic Church will be buried in the state of St. Peter's Basilica (St. Peter's Basilica). The former pope, who resigned as Pope in 2013, died on April 2, 2021 at the age of 96. The Vatican says that Benedict XVI-born Joseph Ratzinger is the oldest surviving pope in modern times and the first person to resign in nearly 600 years. He has been ill for some time, and his death comes after medical problems have worsened. His funeral, scheduled for April 10, will begin with the Mass at St. Peter's Basilica (St. Peter's Cathedral). According to church tradition, it will be hosted by the current Pope Francis. The Pope's body will be rested for two days at St. Peter's Basilica starting on April 8, so that people can pay their respects. After the funeral, his body will be transferred to a nearby church. The funeral will be held in accordance with the traditional rules of the Pope's mourning, which is simpler than many other funerals. The Pope's reputation will not be buried with the dignity and honor of a pope in power, and the scale of the funeral will be more modest than that of his predecessor, Pope John Paul II. While political and religious dignitaries from around the world are expected to attend, there is no national funeral. At the request of his family, no public ceremonies or events will be held to commemorate the Pope's death. However, the Vatican has said it will publish a mourning book on its website for people to leave messages. The Pope's honor will be buried in the secret of St. Peter's Basilica, and he will be buried as well as all the honours received after the death of the pope. Pope Benedict has been remembered as a bridge between different Christian denominations, emphasizing the Church's doctrine and support for traditional Catholic values. He is also known for supporting the Church in healing this broken world by promoting peace, social justice and interreligious dialogue. He is also loved by many because he is a compassionate and gentle person. His love for people of all backgrounds was evident during his papal career. His legacy will be remembered by many in the Catholic Church and beyond. The Roman Catholic Church will always be grateful for the service and dedication of Pope Benedict XVI, whose life, work and legacy will be celebrated in the days and years to come.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "According to the British Met Office, 2022 was the warmest year ever. The average temperature is 10.8 degrees Celsius (51.4 degrees Fahrenheit), which is the hottest year since records began in 1884. According to the Bureau of Meteorology, average temperatures in England and Wales are 1.2 degrees Celsius higher than the average for the period from 1981 to 2010; Scotland is above the average of 0.7 degrees Celsius and Northern Ireland is above the average of 1.1 degrees Celsius. The UK will be the world's first major economy to legislate on a net zero emission target by 2050. The Met Office said 2021 and 2022 were the warmest two years on record, but it was 2022 that finally set a record. \"2020-2022 is the warmest three years in Britain's history, with only a tiny difference between the two,\" said Professor Stephen Belcher, chief scientist at the Met Office. \"Our record shows that temperatures in the UK have been rising steadily over the past few decades, and there is no sign of a slowing trend,\" he added. The UK is not the only country affected by the climate crisis. According to data from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), 2020 was the warmest year on record, followed closely by 2019 and 2022. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) report shows that, across the combined land and ocean surface, global average temperatures are 1.2 degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial levels. The World Meteorological Organization said 2019, 2020 and 2022 were the warmest three years on record, while the warmest 16 years since records began have occurred since 2005. In the UK, the effects of climate warming can be seen in longer and hoter summers, with increased flood events, more frequent and intense storms, and an increased risk of extreme weather events such as heat waves and droughts. According to a report by the UK's Met Office, the climate crisis is affecting all parts of the UK and \"unusually\" temperatures are becoming more frequent. It said the rise in average temperatures could be caused by human-induced global warming. The meteorological agency's report adds that warming will bring more extreme weather events and long-term changes to the environment, such as a reduction in cold periods, fewer snow days and earlier spring flowering. According to the Bureau of Meteorology, southern England has the highest temperatures, while central England is just below average; Northern Ireland and Scotland are slightly above average. Overall, the Met Office said the temperature rise was significant but \"not enough to bring Britain out of the cooler half of the global climate system.\" The UK is one of many countries that have committed to taking steps to reduce emissions in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement. The government has launched a series of climate initiatives, including setting net zero emissions targets by 2050, and this week the prime minister announced plans to plant 30 million trees by 2025. The government is also investing billions of pounds in green energy initiatives such as hydrogen, renewable energy and low-carbon transportation. The Met Office's report says that efforts will be needed if the UK is to avoid the worst effects of the climate crisis, such as a 2deg C rise in global temperatures by the end of this century. The British Met Office said that if global temperatures continue to rise, the UK is likely to continue to increase and the impact of climate warming will become more severe. \"The UK has warmed by 1C since the record began,\" Professor Bellcher said, adding: \"We need immediate action to reduce emissions, reduce the risk of further warming and protect people, livelihoods and the natural environment in the UK and around the world from climate impacts.\"", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "MANILA/BEIJING, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr will fly to Beijing on Tuesday for a three-day visit, during which he is expected to discuss, among other things, Beijing's activities in the disputed South China Sea that Manila describes as illegal.\n\nSpeaking ahead of his flight, Marcos said he looked forward to meeting President Xi Jinping and that \"the issues between our two countries are problems that do not belong between two friends such as the Philippines and China\".\n\nThis will be the second face-to-face meeting between Marcos and Xi after their November meeting in Thailand, and comes as the Philippines has raised concerns over reported Chinese construction activities and the \"swarming\" of Beijing's vessels in disputed waters of the South China Sea.\n\nLast week, a Philippine foreign ministry official said talks with Xi would include China's actions in the South China Sea.\n\nChina's foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin on Friday did not mention the South China Sea but said the visit \"will focus on an in-depth exchange of views on bilateral relations and regional and international issues of common concern\".\n\nIt will promote cooperation in agriculture, infrastructure, energy and culture to create a \"golden era\", Wang said.\n\nAnalysts expect Marcos to use the trip to help rebalance his country's foreign policy, which under previous leader Rodrigo Duterte moved closer to China and away from the United States.\n\nWhile the Philippines is a defence ally of the United States, under Duterte it set aside a territorial spat over the South China Sea in exchange for Chinese investment.\n\nBeijing claims much of the South China Sea, where about $3 trillion in ship-borne trade passes annually, with the area becoming a flashpoint for Chinese and U.S. tensions around naval operations.\n\nIn an address last May, Marcos vowed he would not lose an inch of Philippine territory to any foreign power, drawing cheers from advocates of a 2016 arbitral ruling invalidating China's expansive claims in the South China Sea.\n\nSince Marcos, the son of the late strongman who fled into exile in Hawaii during a 1986 \"people power\" uprising, came into office, he has twice met with U.S. President Joe Biden abroad.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Vice President Kamala Harris also visited the Southeast Asian country last year and assured Manila that Washington would defend the Philippines if it were attacked in the South China Sea.\n\nMarcos is clearly \"inching away from the extreme pivot to China\", Renato Cruz De Castro, an international affairs analyst at De La Salle University in Manila, said.\n\nBut while De Castro expects the South China Sea issue to be brought up, he does not expect Beijing to alter its position.\n\n\"At the end of the day, China's goal is to force us to accept the fait accompli, that they will be operating within our exclusive economic zone,\" De Castro said.\n\nReporting by Karen Lema and Neil Jerome Morales in Manila and Yew Lun Tian in Beijing; Editing by Ed Davies and Himani Sarkar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Basic necessities Around the world, people are dealing with an unprecedented spike in prices for basic necessities such as food and gasoline, and many wonder why. While inflation has been pointed out, a growing number of experts believe that corporate greed is also contributing to this problem. The recent surge in the price of basic commodities has been most severe in poorer countries, as their economies are largely dependent on food staples such as rice and corn, which are prone to price volatility. In many of these countries, rising prices have led to protests and political unrest. In the United States, prices for commodities such as dairy, beef and pork have reached historic highs. Some even cited corporate greed as one reason. At the heart of the problem is that many of the world's largest food companies have been accused of engaging in anti-competitive behavior and rising prices. This has led to commodity prices being too high for many who need them most. In the United States, for example, an antitrust lawsuit against agricultural giant Monsanto led to its subsidiary Bayer being ordered to pay $265 million to settle charges of engaging in anti-competitive behavior. Subsequently, a federal judge ruled that Bayer acted as a monopoly on the corn seed and soybean markets. In Brazil, a series of surveys show that several major food companies are using unfair practices to push up prices. In India, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) has uncovered a major scandal involving Nestle that suggests the company has been manipulating product prices in the milk and dairy industry. Thus, it is clear that corporate greed played a role in rising prices for basic necessities. This has led to feelings of anger and frustration among many who have struggled to get out of trouble. At the same time, there are a number of measures that can be taken to try to alleviate this problem, such as some countries imposing restrictions on the amount companies charge for food staples, which in some cases are effective but may be difficult to implement. It is also important to ensure strict enforcement of antitrust laws so that companies do not take advantage of their dominant market position. In addition, governments need to ensure their economies are open to competition. Many countries have laws that protect certain industries from competition, allowing companies to artificially keep prices high. Finally, the public needs to be aware of the potential dangers of corporate greed and ready to speak out when they see companies engaging in unfair behavior. In conclusion, while inflation undoubtedly plays a role in rising prices for basic necessities, it is clear that corporate greed is also partly responsible. Therefore, governments must take steps to protect consumers and ensure strict enforcement of antitrust laws.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "When President Donald Trump takes office, he likes to fight against \"fake news media,\" and he often accuses the New York Times, The Washington Post, and CNN of spreading false information or making \"biased\" coverage of his administration. However, despite his strong opposition to mainstream media, his own political team and supporters have subscribed to several major media outlets, including The New York Times and The Washington Post. The information was revealed after the Guardian obtained nearly 30,000 emails from Brad Parscale, Trump's 2020 campaign manager, dated November 2016 to February 2020, showing that Pascal signed newspaper subscriptions for various media on behalf of Trump supporters. E-mails show that Pascal has signed up for the Trump campaign and its supporters in The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal. In addition, Pascal has signed with USA Today, Bloomberg, Politico, and other media outlets. Pascal's email also shows that Trump's team is actively seeking to influence the media. In a 2017 email to Fox News executives, Pascal asked for favorable coverage of the government; in other emails, he asked the media to highlight Trump's policy achievements. Meanwhile, Trump's team has been aggressively attacking mainstream media. Pascal's email shows that he was involved in a campaign to discredit the media and spread false stories about the media reporting on the Trump administration. Trump's team also used these emails to coordinate attacks on the media. In one email, Pascal suggested that the Trump campaign should create a \"fake news\" website to undermine the credibility of mainstream media. Despite Trump's public opposition to mainstream media, his own political team subscribed and tried to influence several major media outlets. They even coordinated attacks on the media and spread fake news to undermine their credibility. Trump's political team seems to be aware of the power of mainstream media and is trying to use it to gain an advantage. While Trump may have had a poor relationship with the media during his presidency, his own political team appears to recognize its importance and has subscribed to several major media outlets.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Volgende week komt het langverwachte autobiografische boek van prins Harry, Spare (Reserve) uit, en de Britse krant The Guardian heeft alvast een exemplaar ingezien, waar aardig schokkende dingen in staan. Zo vertelt Harry uitgebreid over een ruzie met zijn broer prins William in 2019, die fysiek werd.\n\nPrins Harry: 'William viel me fysiek aan'\n\nDe passage begint met prins Harry die een confrontatie in zijn huis in Londen in 2019 beschrijft. Hij schrijft dat prins William tijdens een bezoek in hun toenmalige huis Nottingham Cottage op de grond van Kensington Palace, uithaalde naar vrouw Meghan Markle.\n\nPrins William zou Meghan 'moeilijk', 'onbeschoft' en 'opruiend' hebben genoemd, waarop prins Harry hem vervolgens beschuldigde van het 'napraten van de pers'. De confrontatie escaleerde, zo schrijft Harry, en ze begonnen tegen elkaar te schreeuwen. Er werden veel beledigingen volgens Harry geuit, waarna William beweerde dat hij alleen maar probeerde te helpen. Harry zei hierop: 'Ben je serieus? Mij helpen? Sorry, noem je dit zo? Mij \u200b\u200bhelpen?'\n\nBlijkbaar maakte die opmerking William woedend, waarop hij dreigend op hem af kwam. Hierop liep Harry, zo schrijft hij, naar de keuken, en William volgde. Over wat er toen gebeurde schrijft Harry in Spare:\n\n'Ik gaf mijn broer een glas water en zei: \"Willy, ik kan niet met je praten als je zo bent.\" Hij zette het water neer, noemde me een andere naam en kwam toen op me af. Het gebeurde allemaal zo snel. Zo ontzettend snel. Hij greep me bij mijn kraag, scheurde mijn ketting en sloeg me op de grond. Ik belandde op de kom van de hond, die onder mijn rug barstte en de stukjes sneden in me. Ik bleef daar even versuft liggen, stond toen op en zei hem dat hij weg moest gaan.'\n\n'Je hoeft dit niet aan Meg te vertellen'\n\nPrins Harry schrijft dat prins William hem vervolgens aanspoorde om terug te slaan, daarbij verwijzend naar gevechten die ze als kinderen hadden. Harry zegt dat hij weigerde dit te doen en William ging de deur uit. Blijkbaar had hij niet veel later spijt en bood zijn excuses aan. Toen William weer vertrok, zo schrijft Harry, 'draaide hij zich om en zei: \"Je hoeft Meg dit niet te vertellen.\"'\n\nHierop zei Harry: 'Bedoel je dat je me aanviel?'. 'Ik heb je niet aangevallen, Harold,' antwoordde William hierop.\n\nPrins Harry laat in Spare weten dat hij het Meghan Markle ook niet meteen vertelde, maar wel zijn therapeut belde. Toen Meghan later de schaafwonden en blauwe plekken op zijn rug opmerkte, vertelde hij het haar pas. Harry schrijft dat ze na het horen van het voorval 'niet zo verrast was en niet zo boos', maar wel 'vreselijk verdrietig.'\n\nSpare (Reserve) komt op 10 januari uit.

{"text": "Netflix is no stranger to providing us with highly nuanced and profound characters, but they may have surpassed their new series on Wednesday. The show tells the story of a young woman who finds her true identity in a vibrant, complex and often volatile Latin cultural world. The story of Marlena Zarate, a young Latina woman who discovers that her father, Juan Carlos Hernandez, was born in Mexico and illegally crossed the border into the United States as a child. This revelation inspired Wednesday to explore her identity as a Latina woman and learn more about her culture. Through the combination of memoirs, dialogue, music and dance, viewers can experience Wednesday's awakening in real time. Despite the seriousness of the situation, the show still maintains a relaxed and pleasant feeling due to the power of the performance. Zarate is happy as the protagonist, Hernandez provides the perfect counterpoint as her skeptical and sometimes harsh father. But what's really striking about Wednesday is the attention it portrays to detail and complex relationships. There are a variety of characters around Wednesday, each with their own unique background, struggles, and victories. From Wednesday's best friend, extroverted and confident Sophia, to her dedicated grandmother, each character brings something special. The writers also explored some of the more subtle aspects of Latin culture, such as the sometimes tense relationship between the Mexican and Puerto Rican communities, the importance of family and faith, and the struggle for financial security. Wednesday did an excellent job on all these topics, rather than appearing like a preaching or rehearsal. In fact, it's at its best when the show uses more relaxed moments to reveal these issues. For example, one of the most interesting moments of the show is that a Puerto Rican friend on Wednesday took her to the Puerto Rico Cultural Festival, where they heatedly discussed the differences between Mexican and Puerto Rican food. The show's focus is on Latin music, with a special emphasis on Tejano, a genre of popular music that originated in the U.S. Mexican-American border region. Wednesday's passion for music and dance was a major part of the series and was used to convey the enormous effects of the character's experience of strength, joy and heartache. In an era when diversity and representation are more important than ever, Wednesday illuminates the vibrant Latin cultural world. By showing us all the beauty, complexity, and potential within it, the show celebrates the beauty of Latin identity and reminds us that this is something to be proud of. The show will leave a lasting impression on anyone watching it.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Private wages grew more than expected in December, the ADP National Employment Report showed on Thursday. Last December, private wages grew by 235,000 jobs, an increase of 108,000 compared to last November, well above the consensus estimate of 145,000. This strong growth marks the seventh straight month in which private sector employment has grown and is also the biggest since last June. The report also shows that the services sector added 199,000 jobs in December, while the goods manufacturing sector added 36,000 jobs. Manufacturing employment rose by 20,000 in December, a fourth straight month of growth. The U.S. job market remains strong, having recovered more than half of the 22 million jobs lost to the Coronavirus pandemic in March and April. Since then, average monthly employment has grown by nearly three million, with unemployment falling from 14.7% in April to 6.7% in November. \"The job market closed with strong momentum in 2020, and employment growth remained stable and above expectations,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"The gains across industries and company sizes are wide-ranging. Many of the job growth comes from companies that have benefited from the pandemic, such as professional and business services, leisure and hospitality, and healthcare,\" said Zandi. However, he pointed out that the report showed that there were still large numbers of job losses in some sectors such as retail and hospitality. \"The labor market is clearly healing, but there's still a long way to go to repair the damage caused by this epidemic,\" Zandi said. According to economists surveyed by Dow Jones, the government will release its December employment report on Friday, which is expected to show that non-agricultural wages increased by 75,000 people in December. The unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged at 6.7%. The ADP report shows that in December, small businesses added 101,000 jobs, medium-sized companies - 92,000 and large enterprises - 42,000. The leisure and hospitality sector added 35,000 jobs, professional and business services - 51,000, and trade, transport and utilities - 18,000. Economists say the labor market's recovery is likely to be supported by a massive stimulus package from the federal government. The $900 billion aid package, passed last December, provides direct payments to individuals, increases unemployment benefits and assistance for small businesses. \"The recovery of the labor market was supported by a wide range of government stimulus measures, including a December bailout package,\" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group. \"However, the economic recovery is likely to slow as the virus continues to spread and new infections are expected to surge on holiday travel in the coming weeks.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "After the Bank of Switzerland lawsuit MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's central bank said on Wednesday it had frozen assets worth $488 million owned by Linde, the world's largest industrial gas company, after Sweden's Swedbank filed a lawsuit against the company. According to the central bank's statement, the asset freeze was imposed after criminal proceedings were instituted against the company and other parties involved in a complex international fraud investigation. The statement said that the decision was made after Swedish state prosecutors informed Russian authorities about the investigation by Sweden Bank. It added that the asset freeze would continue for three months until the results of the investigation were released. Bank of Sweden filed a lawsuit in August alleging Linde's involvement in multi-billion dollar fraud involving several banks and companies. According to the lawsuit, Swedish authorities have identified three individuals who organized a complex fraud that defrauded Svedbank for more than $1 billion in funds in 2018. Linde denied any wrongdoing, saying at the time that he was cooperating fully with authorities and would provide all necessary documents to investigate the matter. Lind said it believes it has acted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, and is not involved in any criminal activity. The fraud scheme involved several banks, including UBS, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and Barclays, as well as other companies, including Linde. The plan involved the fraudulent transfer of funds to accounts belonging to shell companies that were allegedly used at the time to purchase luxury cars and other assets. The Swedish bank said it had filed claims against several individuals and entities involved in the scheme, including Linde, but had not received a satisfactory response from the company. The central bank said it had also imposed temporary freezes on assets owned by a number of other companies and individuals associated with the fraud scheme. The move comes at a time when the Russian government is stepping up efforts to combat financial crimes, especially international money laundering programs. The government has pledged to take steps to prevent similar programs from happening in the future, including stricter regulations and stronger oversight of financial activities. The central bank said it would continue to monitor the situation and take further action if necessary. The freezing of assets owned by Linde is the latest example of Russia's growing determination to fight financial crime. It is also the first time that Russia has frozen assets of foreign companies as part of a fraud investigation. The frozen $488 million represents only a small portion of Linde's global assets, which are valued at $25.8 billion. It remains to be seen how the situation will develop and the results of the investigation. At the same time, the asset freeze will remain unchanged, meaning Linde will not be able to access or use the frozen funds.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "It's a crazy journey for the food industry in 2020. As the epidemic forces restaurants to shut down, fast food chains shift operations, and grocery stores limit customers, it seems that the industry will get into trouble. But then something magical happened. Instead of falling into a sea of turbulent uncertainty, the food industry found innovative ways to interact with customers and keep sales growing. Here are some of the most creative food marketing tips this year: One day delivery of Taco Bell: This year, Taco Bell launched a one-day meal delivery service across the United States that surprised everyone. The fast food giant has partnered with Grubhub to provide customers with convenient meals delivery without having to leave their homes. Customers can order their favorite Taco Bell products online and deliver them to the door on the same day. The promotion was very successful, and also a good reminder of the power of convenience. Taco Bell is able to attract customers who may think that they have no other choice during the pandemic, and remind people of the value of convenience in difficult times. McDonald's McDelivery Art Gallery: When McDonald's decided to celebrate its delivery service this year, it did so in a unique way. The fast food giant launched the McDelivery Art Gallery, a virtual exhibition where customers can view more than 500 pieces of artwork packaged exclusively with McDonald's. Art galleries can be accessed online and through their delivery apps, encouraging customers to explore works and vote for their favorites, while also having the opportunity to purchase limited edition items and merchandise. The exhibition is a good example of how a company can use its products to engage customers in meaningful ways, while celebrating the artists who helped create their work. Burger King's video streaming service: Burger King made a sensation when it announced the launch of its own video streaming service, known as \"Hamburg King TV\", which allows customers to play movies and TV shows while waiting for orders to be ready. The streaming service is available in the restaurant and through its app. Customers are able to watch their favorite shows, as well as exclusive content from Burger King. Burger King is able to attract customers through its innovative streaming service, while also providing them with an additional incentive to order from restaurants. Crispy Kreme's National Nut Day: Starting in 2020, Krispy Kreme's National Doughnut Day is another notable promotion. The chain celebrates the holiday with a free doughnut for customers at every purchase. This is a great way to encourage customers to support the chain, while also rewarding their loyalty. In addition to the free doughnut, Krispy Kreme also launched an interesting interactive experience called \"Krispy Kreme World\", which allows customers to explore the virtual world while receiving rewards and learning about the history of the chain. This promotion is a good reminder of how businesses can leverage technology to attract customers in new and exciting ways. Overall, this has been an incredible year for the food industry. Even during the pandemic, these innovative marketing techniques have demonstrated the industry's creativity and resilience. We can't wait to see what 2021 brings!", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The award-winning actor, Jeremy Renner, was recently seriously injured while using snowballs and found himself in danger. Now, after a detailed investigation, the local sheriff has determined that Reiner's incident was just an unfortunate accident. It all started on December 22, when the 49-year-old actor tried to remove snow from his driveway with a snowball. The task turned out to be a bit too ambitious as Renner was soon trapped in the snow and seriously injured in his right arm. The news of Reiner's accident spread quickly, and the actor's fans expressed concern and support for his recovery. However, eventually the story prompted an investigation by the Douglas County Sheriff's Office to determine exactly what had happened. After talking to Reiner and other witnesses, the sheriff's office now concluded that the actor's injury was merely a \"tragic accident\", not involving any hoax. \"The incident involving Jeremy Reiner was the result of an accident,\" the Douglas County Sheriff's Office said in a statement, adding: \"We have determined that no criminal charges will be filed and we are sympathetic to Mr. Reiner's injury.\" The statement also expressed sympathy for Renner and his family, and thanked the public for their attention to this issue. Renner, who has not spoken publicly since the accident, is currently recovering at a local hospital and is expected to make a full recovery. After his injury, he was forced to suspend production of his next film, Mission: Impossible 7, which is expected to be released in 2021. In 2018, he broke his arms while filming a stunt on the Netflix movie Six Underground. At the time, Reiner said in an Instagram post that the incident was \"part of the job\" and that he would soon return to the scene. Reiner is widely loved by fans for his roles in films such as The Avengers, Arrivals and Burn's Legacy. He has been nominated to two Academy Awards for supporting roles in Injured Housewives and American Carnival, and has won several awards, including the Golden Globe Award for his performance in Little Town. He suffered a heartbreaking loss in 2015 when his best friend and assistant, Kristoffer Winters, died suddenly at the age of 36. Hopefully Renner can put this new accident behind him and return to what he does best: entertain his fans with his incredible acting skills. We wish him a speedy recovery!", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "This is an ominous sign for potential home buyers: mortgage rates continue to rise. According to the Association of Mortgage Bankers (MBA), for the first time since the pandemic, 30-year average fixed rate mortgages have climbed above 4%. This is the highest level since February 2020. The 30-year interest rate also exceeded 4% in October 2020 and December 2020, but this is the first time it has remained at that level. Interest rates have been rising for seven of the past eight weeks, which analysts say could be the beginning of a steady rise in mortgage rates. The impact on potential home buyers can be devastating. Higher mortgage rates will not only make it harder for future homeowners to afford new homes, but may also lead to higher prices for existing homes as buyers compete for limited supply. \"In the short term, higher interest rates mean fewer people can get mortgages and buy homes,\" said Matthew Speakman, an economist at Zillow. \"With rising house prices, the number of people in the housing market is falling.\" The surge in mortgage rates has been driven by several factors, including rising inflation and economic improvements. \"The economy is getting stronger, which puts upward pressure on interest rates,\" said Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at Cowen Washington Research Group. The rise in mortgage rates has also been driven by rising demand for real estate. As people continue to adapt to new lifestyles during the pandemic, home hunting activity has surged. \"This epidemic exacerbates existing housing shortages and makes it difficult for people to find affordable housing,\" Speakman said, \"which has pushed more buyers into the market.\" The good news is that mortgage rates remain relatively low compared to historical averages. But analysts warn that higher mortgage rates could lead to fewer home purchases and rising house prices. \"We believe that rising mortgage rates will cause some buyers to abandon the market and force prices to drop slightly,\" Seberg said. \"However, increasing demand for housing should offset some of the effects of high interest rates.\" The consensus among analysts is that if buyers are serious about buying a home, they should take immediate action. House prices may remain low for some time, but they can also rise rapidly. \"If you're buying a house in the market, it's time to take action,\" Speakman said, adding that \"buyers should take advantage of the current low interest rates while they're still nearby.\" However, potential home buyers should also exercise caution. It is important to ensure that homes are affordable before they can be mortgaged. \"Buyers should make sure to consider the potential cost of future homes, not just today's costs,\" Seiberg said. Clearly, higher mortgage rates do scare potential home buyers. However, as interest rates remain below historical standards, now may be the best time to act. Buyers should move quickly to take advantage of the current market, but they should also ensure that they can afford their dream homes for the future.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".. This year's first major rail strike has caused widespread damage across the country as railway workers walk for 48 hours. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union (RMT) have been on strike since midnight, opening pickup lines at dozens of stations in all major London stations as well as other major UK cities. The industrial action is the result of a long-running dispute between RTM and rail operator Arriva Trains Wales, which provides services in parts of Wales and the Midlands, involving job security and the introduction of new roles. The union accused the company of trying to \"destroy the terms and conditions of its members,\" while Arriva said it was proposing a \"fair and reasonable\" package. The two sides have been negotiating the dispute since last October, but no solution has been reached. The strike is expected to affect about 110,000 rail passengers and Arriva estimates the operation will cost them up to PS400,000 per day. The mixed teams in Wales and the Midlands have been weighed down by this disruption, with few trains throughout the region. Operators have been running a reduced service on their main lines, but are unable to provide any services at all on many local lines. RMT said it was \"disappointing but not surprising\" that Arriva did not accept a proposal for further union negotiations despite the disruption. The union is keen to ensure job safety and has introduced a number of new positions, which they say will ensure better service for passengers, while Ariva insists they are offering the union \"fair and reasonable\" deals. The strike is expected to end at midnight on Friday, but could be further interrupted as both sides try to reach a settlement. Both sides have expressed their willingness to engage in further negotiations, and RMT has said it is \"ready and willing\" to work towards a deal that avoids future action. At the same time, commuters are frustrated and confused by traffic disruptions, with many traveling long distances to reach their destinations. Industrial actions have also had an impact on other transport networks, with buses and taxis partially loose in the affected areas. Both Arriva and RTM have urged passengers to contact them before travel and plan ahead, while suggesting that there may be further disruptions over the weekend. As the two sides have yet to reach an agreement, further strike action is a very realistic possibility and both Arriva and RTM are urging passengers to remain vigilant and plan ahead.", "label": "machine"}

Their words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMatt (Keene, New Hampshire)\n\nI've had some pretty insane things happen on my shifts \u2014 from an FBI raid during a showing of \"Joker,\" to having to fight off two people who were throwing haymakers at me in the middle of the aisle during a movie. We're in a college town, so things can get pretty crazy.\n\nI've worked at the theater in Keene, New Hampshire for five years. It's a family-owned movie theater, and I love working there. But what I wish customers would do is:\n\n1. Be polite\n\nI'm a nice guy and I love nice customers. I give polite people free popcorn. People who work at your theater are people too \u2014 it doesn't hurt to remember that.\n\n2. Don't throw your trash on the floor\n\nEspecially now, because a lot of places are so short-staffed and it's harder to get employees in to clean, throwing your trash on the floor is very uncool. It's also unnecessary.\n\nI've had customers who, if they're not finished with their popcorn, will just dump it on the floor. Sure, always having something to do means job security for us \u2014 but once in a while, it'd be nice if people were more considerate.\n\n3. Figure out what snacks you want before it's your turn to order\n\nSo many people just tell me they want a soda and popcorn \u2014 I can't do anything with that. So then I have to ask, what size soda do you want? What kind of soda do you want? What size popcorn do you want? Do you want butter on it? It's tedious.\n\n4. Put away your phone\n\nI can't believe I still have to tell people to put their phones away during the movie. We check our theater several times throughout the showings to make sure people aren't on their cell phones. We give multiple warnings, and yet I still have to escort people out for not listening. We give two strikes and after that, it's like, come on.\n\nTarik (New York, New York)\n\nI work at a theater on the upper west side of Manhattan. I've been working here for five years now.\n\n5. Read your ticket stub\n\nTarik said customers rarely bother to read their ticket stub \u2014 which leads to them asking redundant questions. Courtesy of Tarik\n\nTheater patrons purchase a ticket, whether it's online or at the box office, and then never look at the information on the stub. Pretty much everything you need to know in regards to the when, where, and how of your experience is on the stub.\n\n6. Know the name of the film you're coming to see\n\nWhen customers add words to the title or just completely botch it, it drives us insane. We're currently showing a film called \"All the Beauty and the Bloodshed,\" and I've had customers come up to the window asking for a ticket to \"brains and beauty,\" \"bloody beautiful,\" and everything in between.\n\nScott (Hayden, Idaho)\n\nI've worked at my theater in Idaho for just under five months now. Customers here are generally very kind and understanding \u2014 but some things I wish customers would do are:\n\n7. Don't ignore \"please wait\" signs\n\nScott works at a theater in Idaho, and said customers barge past \"please wait\" signs. Courtesy of Scott\n\nStrolling into uncleaned theaters is annoying and gets in the way of us cleaning properly after a showing.\n\n8. Don't just ask for \"diet\" as a beverage without elaborating\n\nThere are likely three different \"diet\" drinks here.\n\n9. Don't show up 30 minutes late to your movie\n\nI understand showing up late because you want to skip the ads, but I'll likely be doing other duties like restocking or cleaning, and we don't like to have to be dragged back to the front for stragglers.\n\nIf you work in Hollywood and would like to share your story, email Eboni Boykin-Patterson at eboykinpatterson@insider.com.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The spread of the Covid-19 virus in China has prompted a shift toward traditional medicine to respond to the epidemic. With the arrival of a new wave of infections, Chinese authorities have begun to promote the use of lemons, peaches and TCM (TCM). The National Health Commission (NHC) announced the news in Beijing on Tuesday, at a time when China reported the highest number of new Covid-19 cases in months. The NHC said lemons, peaches and Chinese medicines could be used to boost people's resistance to the virus and help fight the spread of the disease. \"Lemons, peaches and Chinese medicine are our key weapons against Covid-19,\" said Zhang Wenhong, NHC's chief virus expert. \"They can help boost our immunity, prevent the spread of the virus, and allow us to get through this difficult period.\" The Chinese government is encouraging citizens to use fruits and medicines as part of their daily diet. People are advised to drink lemonade in the morning, eat peaches throughout the day as snacks, and use traditional drugs as a preventive measure. These measures are seen as part of China's broader efforts to control the spread of the virus. The government has implemented a range of measures, including wearing masks, social isolation and contact tracking, to stem the wave of infection. China has also been promoting traditional Chinese medicine as part of its response to the Covid-19 pandemic, and authorities have opened a number of specialized TCM clinics to treat patients with Covid-19, which are comprised of practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine who use many methods such as traditional Chinese medicine, diet, acupuncture and massage to treat symptoms of the virus. The Chinese government is also promoting the use of traditional Chinese medicine to prevent the spread of the virus, and China is conducting a national campaign on traditional Chinese medicine to raise awareness about the benefits of traditional Chinese medicine and encourage people to incorporate it into their daily work. Chinese experts are optimistic about the potential of TCM against Covid-19. Studies have shown that some traditional herbs in China can block virus replication and reduce the severity of disease, and also believe that TCM can stimulate the immune system to help the body fight the virus more effectively. However, China is turning to traditional medicine and natural foods to overcome the threat of the virus. Lemons, peaches, and Chinese medicines have been hailed as tools to build people's resilience and help them fight the virus.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "LAS VEGAS\u2014On this nippy January morning here, I tried the Dyson Zone air purifying headphones for the first time. My first impression: I was already chilly, so the purified airflow felt cold on my face. I almost wished there was a warm air option, but that seemed like an entirely separate engineering challenge\u2014maybe an idea for a future iteration, I suggested to Dyson's representatives overseeing my visit with the Zone.\n\nI'm weirdly obsessed with air purifiers, and use several of Dyson's tower models at home, so when I first heard about the Zone last March, I was excited\u2014probably unreasonably so. The Zone is exciting not just because it marks Dyson's first venture into both audio and wearable technology, but because it's different from anything else on the market. Air purifying necklaces exist (and don't work well, according to Dyson Senior Design Manager David Hil), but the Zone is the first air purifier I've seen designed specifically for the face. And, oh yeah, it's also a pair of noise-cancelling headphones.\n\n(Credit: Dyson/Angela Moscaritolo)\n\nI'm not the only one intrigued: The futuristic device, which aims to combat outdoor air and noise pollution, went viral for its Bane-like aesthetic(Opens in a new window). Some say they wouldn't be caught dead wearing the thing, but I couldn't wait to get my hands on a pair. So when Dyson invited me to try them out during this week at CES, I made the meeting my top priority.\n\nIt's a Lewk\n\nI spent about 30 minutes with the Zone, supervised by several Dyson reps the entire time (the same is true for every member of the media who has tried them so far). I'll reserve my full judgment until I have the opportunity to test the product at length in the privacy of my home. But based on my brief hands-on experience with the Zone, I'm impressed.\n\n(Credit: Damiano Crognali)\n\nThis might be a controversial opinion, but I think they look cool. Even if you dislike the design, you have to admit\u2014it's a lewk. Plus, maximalism is in (just look at the Apple Watch Ultra). When I caught my reflection in the mirror while wearing them for the first time, I let out a chuckle because, yes, they are outlandishly big. Early adopters will need some confidence to wear these in public, for sure.\n\nWhile wearing the Zone, the purified air gently blowing in front of my mouth and nose had no discernible odor, but the same was true for the ambient air. I suggested someone light a cigarette so I could test its odor-fighting performance, but no one obliged.\n\nInside each ear cup is a tiny compressor motor and a dual-layer air filter. The first layer, a negatively charged electrostatic filter, promises to capture 99% of inhalable particles down to 0.1 microns in size, particularly brake dust emitted from cars, as well as pollen and bacteria. The second layer, made of potassium-enriched carbon, absorbs dangerous city gases, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2). A duct on each earcup allows clean air to flow into the visor, which sits around the lower half of your face without touching it.\n\n(Credit: Damiano Crognali)\n\nDespite its size, the Zone felt pretty light and comfortable on my head. With the visor attached, the Zone weighs about 24 ounces. Removing the visor drops its weight to about 21 ounces.\n\nThe inside of the headband and the ear cushions are both lined with soft microfiber\u2014if you're familiar with the Lululemon yoga mat towel(Opens in a new window), it's a similar fabric. The headband and the face visor are both easily adjustable to fit a range of head sizes.\n\nThe removable face visor magnetically attaches to the headphones. It took me a few tries to figure out how to snap it on, but once I adjusted it for size, it was easy. When you pull the visor down towards your chin, the air purification and any music you have playing through the headphones automatically stop. You can turn the music back on when the visor is down if you wish, but the air purifier only works when the visor is up.\n\n(Credit: Dyson/Angela Moscaritolo)\n\nThe Zone has two buttons, one on the back of each ear cup. The left button lets you cycle through airflow speeds (Low, Medium, High, Auto, and Off), and the right button is a joystick that lets you control the audio (move it up/down to adjust the volume, left/right to skip tracks, press it to play/pause, or hold it down to activate your smartphone voice assistant (Siri or Google Assistant).\n\nIn Auto air purification mode, the Zone automatically adjusts its fan speed based on movement data captured by a built-in accelerometer. To test this feature, I got up from my seat and started jumping up and down, and the fan speed predictably ramped up on its own. As a side note, I don't necessarily recommend wearing the Zone while engaging in vigorous activity. It should be fine for a brisk walk, but it shifted and felt like it might fall off as I jumped up and down.\n\nTo correctly position the visor in front of your face (so it's covering both your nose and mouth), you may need to move the headband slightly back on your head. When I first started wearing the Zone, I had the headband too far forward on my head, and the visor only covered my mouth, leaving my nose exposed.\n\n(Credit: Angela Moscaritolo)\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to learn that the visor is completely washable with cool water and soap. When it gets dirty, you can take the visor apart (it comprises four pieces), and wash it with the included cleaning brush.\n\nThe Audio Experience\n\nWhile wearing the Zone with air purification enabled, you can hear the motor running. It sounds like a fan, and the volume gets louder as you increase the airflow speed. With music playing, you can only really hear the motor running with the airflow speed set to Medium or High. On the Low airflow speed, your music should drown out the sound of the fans.\n\n(Credit: Damiano Crognali)\n\nDouble-tapping the side of either ear cup switches between noise-cancellation modes (Isolation, which offers the highest level of ANC; Transparency, which amplifies outside sounds so you can be more aware of your surroundings; and Off). To test the ANC, I went out on the balcony, where a large air conditioning unit was running, and Transparency mode almost totally eliminated that background noise.\n\nI'm no audio expert, so I plan to team up with my colleague Tim Gideon, who is in for a full Zone review. That said, music playing through the Zone sounded sufficiently loud and clear to me. Via its companion MyDyson mobile app, you can choose from three equalizer modes: Enhanced, Neutral, and Bass Boost. I didn't hear much of a difference between Enhanced and Neutral, both of which offer a fairly neutral sound signature, but Bass Boost noticeably punched up the audio.\n\n(Credit: Damiano Crognali)\n\nIn terms of availability, the Zone is slated to hit the market in China this month before launching in the US, UK, Hong Kong, and Singapore in March. In the US, it will be available in two colorways: Ultra Blue/Prussian Blue, and a premium Prussian Blue/Bright Copper version. Pricing starts at $949.

{"text": "The Illinois government is pushing for a ban on assault weapons after mass shootings in 2021. On Monday, the state House of Representatives approved a bill prohibiting the possession and sale of semi-automatic weapons, high-capacity magazines and certain other firearms. The vote was 57 votes to 49, with two representatives voting, and the bill is now in the Senate. The bill, introduced by State Rep. Dan Bradley (D-Elgin), would make it illegal to possess semiautomatic weapons with detachable cartridges and the ability to fire multiple rounds quickly. It would also prohibit the sale and transfer of those weapons, as well as the sale of large capacity magazines and certain other firearms. The bill includes exceptions for the possession and sale of weapons used by military personnel, law enforcement officers and members of competitive shooting clubs. Supporters of the bill argue that in order to reduce gun violence in Illinois and other states, it is necessary to ban assault weapons. \"We're just asking for common sense regulations and protections for all Illinoisns,\" said Rep. Bradley, \"that these weapons have been used in many of the deadliest mass shootings in our nation's history. These weapons pose a threat to our communities, and nobody should be able to access them except our military, law enforcement, and race shooting clubs.\" Opponents of the bill argued that it would violate the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens and would do little to prevent crime. They also argued that it would be difficult to enforce and would lead to arbitrary arrests of gun owners. \"This legislation will not make people safer, and is another attempt by anti-gun gun politicians to deprive the Second Amendment of their freedom,\" said Rep. Ryan Sparia (R-Peoria). The House vote comes after the Senate approved the bill last month, and Gov. J.B. Pritzker has said he will sign it if it is passed by both houses. The legislation is part of an effort to strengthen gun control laws following several high-profile mass shootings. In 2021, a gunman killed six people at a bar in Aurora, Illinois, and a mass shooting in Boulder, Colorado left 22 dead. Illinois lawmakers are now looking for other states, such as Colorado and California, that have implemented similar assault weapons bans. \"We must stand up and do everything we can to keep our communities safe,\" said MP Bradley. \"The bill is a step in the right direction. It's time for us to take action to protect citizens and children.\" The House vote comes as President Biden urges Congress to pass legislation expanding background checks and enforcing a national assault weapons ban. If passed and signed into law, Illinois would become the third state to ban assault weapons after California and New Jersey. Critics argue that banning certain types of firearms will do little to reduce gun violence, as criminals are less likely to comply with the law and many states don't have a comprehensive background check system. Still, supporters say the bill is an important step in efforts to reduce gun violence. \"We have to stand together and take action now to protect Illinois citizens from gun violence,\" Rep. Bradley said, adding: \"It's time for this bill to make our community safer.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "\u201cWe Need to Take Away Children\u201d\n\nWhat a superb piece of investigative journalism by Caitlin Dickerson. I hope the detailed history of this sordid story leads readers and voters to be more diligent about watching the way governments, both state and federal, deal with immigration.\n\nRon Kochman\n\nKenilworth, Ill.\n\nExplore the November 2022 Issue Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. View More\n\nCaitlin Dickerson\u2019s breathtaking investigation exposed the malice and incompetence of the Trump administration, as well as the failure of hundreds of government officials to stop a policy that deliberately traumatized thousands of children and parents. It reaffirms why Physicians for Human Rights concluded in 2020 that family separation meets the United Nations\u2019 criteria for torture and enforced disappearance.\n\nAs outlined in the UN\u2019s Convention Against Torture\u2014which the United States ratified in 1994\u2014four elements must be met to legally define acts as torture. Torture (1) causes severe physical or mental pain or suffering; (2) is done intentionally, (3) for the purpose of coercion, punishment, or intimidation; and (4) is conducted by a state official or with state consent or acquiescence. Both Dickerson\u2019s investigation and PHR\u2019s reports on the health consequences of family separation show that all four criteria for torture were met. The trauma from these separations did not disappear when families were finally reunited. As a perpetrator of state torture, the U.S. government is obligated to provide prompt and effective redress to survivors, including psychological rehabilitative services. Despite calling family separation \u201ccriminal\u201d on the campaign trail, Joe Biden has done little for its survivors. Instead, his administration\u2019s Department of Justice is fighting these families in court and defending the abhorrent family-separation policies of the Trump administration.\n\nThank you to The Atlantic for keeping this issue in the public spotlight. The officials who devised family separation or who stood by while this abuse was perpetrated may wish to turn the page and move on, but the thousands of families who were separated cannot do so until the U.S. government acknowledges the harm it inflicted and provides redress.\n\nRanit Mishori\n\nSenior Medical Adviser, Physicians for Human Rights\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nAs a state child-protection caseworker for 30 years and, more simply, as a human being, I was horrified when I first heard of Donald Trump\u2019s family-separation policy several years ago. Caitlin Dickerson\u2019s putting names and faces to that policy gave it a more poignant and personal horror.\n\nI grieve for the America that these leaders are carving out for my children and grandchildren. I feel anger and disgust at the moral bankruptcy and incompetence of the Trump world, and I was brought to outrage and despair by the report that border agents mocked immigrants. How can one possibly conceive of ripping a baby from a mother\u2019s breast while chanting \u201cHave a happy Mother\u2019s Day\u201d? Is this the face of America? May God help us all!\n\nFred Putnam\n\nHoulton, Maine\n\nI could read only a page or two at a time of Caitlin Dickerson\u2019s article. The pain of the families being ripped apart was palpable. Reunification will be merely the first step; healing the rupture of trust will take far longer. Studies of trauma indicate that this pain and its consequences may be passed on for generations. We, the people of the United States, allowed our government to do this. We should hang our heads in shame.\n\nWe can\u2019t heal the immigrants\u2019 trauma or mend the hearts of the perpetrators. What we must do is update and restructure our immigration system, now.\n\nJudith Matson\n\nVista, Calif.\n\nLet Brooklyn Be Loud\n\nThe sound of gentrification is silence, Xochitl Gonzalez wrote in the September issue.\n\nReading Xochitl Gonzalez\u2019s description of the \u201caesthetic\u201d of silence, I realized that it was one I grew up with, was trained to revere and need. I consider noise\u2014whether from a stereo, a car horn, an argument, a racing motorcycle, or a party\u2014an intrusion, a violation of my space and contentment. Why the need for so much quiet? What joy and life does this need snuff out in others and in myself?\n\nI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll succeed, but the next time I\u2019m bothered by another\u2019s shouting, I\u2019ll try to remind myself that life is a loud affair. It was always meant to be, from a baby\u2019s first cry.\n\nJean Cheney\n\nSalt Lake City, Utah\n\nI love quiet. I\u2019m currently in a protracted struggle with my local city council to have high-powered leaf blowers banned. They are an incredible nuisance, disrupting not only every sleeping child and working neighbor for a 10-block radius, but also every bird and bee.\n\nYet I fully agree with the author that we should let our neighbors speak, laugh, cry as loud as they wish\u2014and, yes, even party. I do not want to live in a world subsumed by machine noise, but I most definitely want to hear the sound of people living their lives fully.\n\nI believe that my local city council\u2019s exemption of leaf blowers from our local noise ordinance is racist, or at a minimum classist. Consider, for instance, a lively gathering of people of color being reported for a noise violation and the cops showing up. In contrast, my rich white neighbor can rest at ease knowing that their high-powered leaf blowers remain exempt. The implicit statement is that your party, your friends, your life are less important than your neighbor\u2019s manicured lawn.\n\nElliot Cohen\n\nBoulder, Colo.\n\nBehind the Cover\n\nIn this month\u2019s cover story (\u201c Good Luck, Mr. Rice \u201d), Jake Tapper writes about C. J. Rice, who was sentenced to decades in prison as a teenager and whose experiences reveal the empty promise of the constitutional right to counsel. For the cover, we commissioned the artist Fulton Leroy Washington, known as MR WASH, to paint a portrait of Rice . Washington recognized much of his own story in Rice\u2019s\u2014he spent 21 years in prison for nonviolent drug convictions before having his sentence commuted in 2016 by President Barack Obama. \u201cI realized that C.J. and I were similarly situated,\u201d Washington told me. \u201cHe\u2019s on a journey, on a path, that I have been blessed to make it all the way through.\u201d\n\nAs a child in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles, Washington cultivated an interest in art through jigsaw puzzles. \u201cWe\u2019d sit at the dining-room table, the family looking through the box and trying to find the piece that fits,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI would see the art coming together.\u201d But he truly started honing his craft during his trial, to pass the time. \u201cIn the courtroom, I would draw butterflies and characters, and even little people, in pencil.\u201d\n\nRead: An interview with Fulton Leroy Washington about the November issue cover art\n\nAfter his conviction in 1997\u2014a life sentence without parole\u2014Washington began experimenting with oil paints in prison. He focused on the human form, developing his signature style\u2014photorealistic subjects with large tears featuring smaller portraits within. \u201cI did a thousand eyes on one canvas, a whole bunch of noses, ears from all angles, a whole bunch of smiles,\u201d he said. He continued to create over the course of his incarceration, eventually painting the scene that he believes freed him, a prophetic work titled Emancipation Proclamation. In the painting, which depicts then-President Obama signing Washington\u2019s clemency papers, the artist reimagines Francis Bicknell Carpenter\u2019s First Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation by President Lincoln. Two years later, life imitated art, and Washington was freed.

{"text": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nEven millionaires are noticing that grocery shopping has become really expensive. Just listen to Cardi B.\n\nThe rapper posted an expletive-laden video rant on Twitter asking \u201canybody that is responsible\u201d to lower grocery prices because they\u2019ve recently been \u201ctripling up.\u201d\n\nShe said she noticed the skyrocketing prices from a \u201csummary\u201d of money spent in her home every week, prompting her to ask \u201cwhat the f**k is going on?\u201d So, she said she had to see with her own eyes, and went to a grocery store to see the prices for herself.\n\n\u201cLettuce was like $2 a couple of months ago, and now it\u2019s like f**king $7,\u201d Cardi B said in the minute-long video. \u201cOf course I\u2019m going to say something: The f**k?!\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that sh*t is crazy,\u201d she added, sympathizing with \u201cmiddle-class people or people in the hood\u201d about the increase in grocery prices.\n\nCardi B used her platform, consisting of nearly 30 million followers on Twitter, to ask the higher-ups to \u201cput that sh*t the f**k down.\u201d She added that if those responsible for the high prices were to see her post, they might \u201cput it down.\u201d\n\nHer advice during these times? Budgeting, because if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re \u201cgoing to go broke soon.\u201d\n\nThe video is the latest impromptu economic observation from Cardi B, who has previously focused on the lack of housing inventory and the rising cost of living. A few days ago the rapper, worth at least $40 million, tweeted that \u201cgrocery shopping prices are ridiculous right now \u2026 You might as well eat outside!!\u201d\n\nUS food inflation has sparked a cost-of-living crisis. In the year through November, food got 10.6% more expensive, with grocery prices rising 12% and menu prices jumping 8.5%, not adjusted for seasonal swings, the Bureau of Labor Statistics recently said. In that same period, overall inflation rose 7.1%.\n\nDespite Cardi B\u2019s pleas, food prices are hard to control, since they\u2019re affected by a number of factors including extreme weather, diseases impacting crops and livestock, supply chain complications and geopolitical unrest such as the war in Ukraine. That can make it more difficult for the US government to use tactics like raising interest rates to moderate food prices.\n\nHowever, many big corporations have offset those costs by raising prices on consumers, as lawmakers including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren have frequently highlighted, saying the price hikes are \u201cdriven by corporate greed.\u201d\n\nWhen a Cardi B fan asked if the video will decrease prices, the rapper said: \u201cNot necessarily cause of me, but if we bring enough awareness to inflation you never know.\u201d", "label": "human"}

Although these celebrities are only a one-time appearance, they certainly bring some nostalgia to the show. In the spirit of the 90s, the show's soundtrack will consist of all the hit songs from this era, including Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Blink-182, TLC, Back Street Boys and Spice Girls. The series will also give a nod to the classic scenario comedy by showing subtle nods to its predecessor. For example, the \"Cheesy Tuesday\" special, which is a key part of the original program, will be re-released. Like the original show, The Show of the 90s will focus on the friendship between Eric, Donna and their friends.The series is expected to be a fun review of the story of the 1990s with lots of references, jokes and music from the 1990s. For those who want to relive the 1990s, or for those who have never had a chance to experience it, \"That '90s show\" will take them back to an even simpler time. The show will be watched on Evergreen at its premiere on January 19. Don't miss Nostalgia!", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "John Baker, a 53-year-old college graduate from Long Island, New York, is struggling to solve the growing problem of nearly $47,000 in student loan debt that has been unpayable since he first borrowed it in 1994. Unfortunately, Beck's story is common: Like countless other Americans, after nearly three decades of multiple loans, repayment programs, and forgiveness, he was unable to get promises for cancellation of student loan debt. \"I've been stuck in a 25-year bureaucracy nightmare,\" Baker told Business Insider. \"I can't control what happens. I can't get anyone to help me. I'm trapped and I can't get out.\" John Baker first borrowed money to attend college in 1994. His initial loan came from a private lender called Sallie Mae, but in 2004 his loan was sold to government-sponsored lending service provider Navient. At first, Baker was doing well, being able to pay monthly and maintain the loan balance. In 2010, he took part in an income-oriented repayment program to help him keep up with payments. But the process was difficult and complicated. After many back and forth, due to some minor technical issues, he was eventually denied access to his application for a repayment plan. \"I think I did a good job, but they kept denying me,\" Beck said. Since then, he has been stuck in a never-ending registration and exit cycle across various repayment schemes. His debt has soared to $47,000 that he is unable to make any significant progress on repayments. \"It's like I'm trapped in some kind of purgatory,\" he said. Baker has been stuck in student debt for nearly 30 years, with no sign of an end. Despite numerous attempts to contact Navient for help, he received almost no assistance and did not benefit from the heavy burden of his student loan debt. This is the situation faced by millions of Americans with student loan debt who cannot get promised debt cancellation due to bureaucratic red tape. \"It's like they want me to stay on this edge,\" Beck said. While there are many options that can help students with loan debt to individuals, such as loan consolidation, refinancing and debt cancellation, the process of applying for these options can be complex and daunting. Moreover, after the Covid-19 pandemic, the need for federal programs that provide debt relief - such as PAYE and income-based repayment schemes - is increasing. This process can be slow, so it's difficult for people like Baker to get the debt relief they need. \"I just wanted to be able to pay off my debt without having to deal with this bureaucratic nightmare,\" Baker said. His story highlights the difficulties faced by millions of Americans with student loan debt, as well as the challenges they face in getting their promised cancellations. Unfortunately, stories like his are all too common and highlight the need for better processes, regulations, and policies to ensure that those with student loan debt get the cancellations they need. Baker's story also highlights the urgent need to improve debt relief services. For many, the debt crisis has reached a point of irreversibility, and the longer debt relief policies have to catch up, the more people suffer. \"I just wish I could get my life back,\" he said, \"and I just want to be able to start again.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "As we move into the next year, many of us are eager to open new bottles and try new drinks.But for color mixers, the New Year has a special significance beyond normal. To celebrate 2021, three black blenders - Kimberlyade of Beverly Hills, Amor Sprout of Miami and Ramon Edmundo of Chicago - are showing off their favorite New Year's drink. \"It's important to show love and support to a multicultural community. As women of color in the industry, it's a blessing to be able to create their own brand-based drinks and share them with others,\" said Ed. For Ade, the preferred cocktail is \"Color I'm Vibrant\", a mixture of orange vodka, peach fluid, pineapple juice and mango sugar. \"It's a fruit, delicious and refreshing. A surge of passionate fruits adds the perfect hint of sweetness,\" says Ed, \"and he uses a combination of jelly, juice and cream to present vibrant shades.\" Next up is Sprout, who will launch a festive drink called \"Moon Margarita\" in 2021. The drink is mixed with silver tequila, a mixture of sweet and sour flavors, as well as pineapple juice with salt side. Pine added a beam of lemon and a slice of pepper powder to flavor the taste. \"The idea behind Moon Margarita is to celebrate the incredible progress that the industry has made over the past year, while bringing a positive dynamism to the New Year,\" Sprout said. Finally, there is Edmundo's \"California Martini\", which combines vodka, orange lemon juice, cranberry juice and a beam of blue curacao with orange slices and limestone wedges. \"For me, Martini California is a way to celebrate all the diversity, progress and enthusiasm that New Year brings,\" Edmundo said. All three drinks offer different flavors, from the sweetness of my colored fruit to the bite of Margarita on the moon and the softness of Martini in California. No matter which beverage you choose, it's important to remember what Ade, Sprout and Edmundo all recognize - mixing is a craft that everyone can enjoy. \"My goal is to create delicious, creative drinks that everyone can enjoy,\" says Sprout. \"This is the perfect way to bring 2021 - with a taste, a color and a spirit of hope.\" So whether you're going to make a phone call in the new year, be sure to pour yourself a drink, raise your glass, and take a cup for the future.

{"text": "Cases have surged in China since it dropped its zero-COVID policy in December, and the latest models now suggest that at least 1 million people may die as a result. Many countries have responded by policing their borders: Last week, the CDC announced that anyone entering the United States from China would be required to test negative within two days of departure; the U.K., Canada, and Australia quickly followed suit; and the European Union has urged its member states to do the same. (Taking a more extreme tack, Morocco has said it will ban travelers from China from entering altogether.) At a media briefing on Wednesday, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, \u201cIt is understandable that some countries are taking steps they believe will protect their own citizens.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, a Chinese official denounced some of the new restrictions as having \u201cno scientific basis.\u201d She wasn\u2019t wrong. If the goal is to \u201cslow the spread of COVID\u201d from overseas, as the CDC has stated, there is little evidence to suggest that the restrictions will be effective. More important, it wouldn\u2019t matter if they were: COVID is already spreading unchecked in the U.S. and many of the other countries that have new rules in place, so imported cases wouldn\u2019t make much of a difference. The risk is particularly low given the fact that 95 percent of China\u2019s locally acquired cases are being caused by two Omicron lineages\u2014BA.5.2 and BF.7\u2014that are old news elsewhere. \u201cThe most dangerous new variant at the moment is from New York\u2014XBB.1.5\u2014which the U.S. is now busy exporting to the rest of the world,\u201d Christina Pagel, a mathematician who studies health care at University College London, told me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but this is fucking ridiculous.\u201d\n\nBy now, it\u2019s well known that travel restrictions can\u2019t stop COVID from crossing borders. At best, they slow its entry. When Omicron was first detected, in South Africa in late November 2021, America blocked travel from southern-African countries in an attempt to prevent the variant from spreading; by mid-December, Omicron dominated the United States. Restrictions can delay the spread of a variant only if they are implemented while cases are low and before travelers have had a chance to spread it. Such policies were more effective early in the pandemic: A BMJ Global Health review concluded that the initial ban on all travel into or out of Wuhan, China, in January 2020 significantly reduced the number of cases exported to other countries and delayed outbreaks elsewhere by \u201cup to a few weeks.\u201d Later on, such restrictions lost value. The COVID Border Accountability Project, which tracks travel restrictions around the world, has found that border closures did not reduce COVID spread, at least through April 2021, Mary Shiraef, the project\u2019s principal investigator and a political scientist at Notre Dame University, told me. (According to the study, domestic lockdowns did slow transmission.)\n\nAt this stage of the pandemic, restrictions make sense only under two conditions, Pagel said: The country deploying them must have low levels of spread and good control policies, and the restrictions must be applied to all other nations, as opposed to just one. Neither of these conditions is being met right now by any country deploying travel measures against China. Even if a single-point ban did serve some useful purpose, the rules in place for China don\u2019t add up. Predeparture testing likely won\u2019t catch most infected travelers from China, Adam Kucharski, a professor of infectious-disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told me. A person could test negative one day and then positive a few days later. If the point of restrictions is to slow local transmission, Kucharski said, calculations based on his research suggest that travelers should be tested twice: once before they arrive, then about three or four days afterward. Doing so would catch infected travelers who initially tested negative while limiting their window for spreading disease.\n\nRead: Why America scrapped its travel bans\n\nThe best possible outcome of a travel restriction like the one the U.S. now has in place would be a very small delay before the arrival of a catastrophic new variant that has just emerged in China. In that scenario, any extra time might be used to intensify mitigation strategies and assess the degree to which current vaccines are expected to hold up. Historically, though, the time saved by travel bans has been wasted. After countries restricted travel from South Africa to keep Omicron at bay, governments responded by \u201cnot really doing much at all domestically,\u201d Kucharski said. In any case, as my colleague Katherine J. Wu has pointed out, the virus is able to spread easily in China right now without any further changes to its genome. Population immunity there is modest, owing to the country\u2019s low natural-infection rate and less effective vaccines, so the virus can infect people perfectly well as is.\n\nThe travel restrictions on China will have little impact on the spread of COVID, but they do send a forceful political message. The U.S. measures are meant to pressure China, by slowing its economic rebound, into being transparent about its COVID situation, Stephen Morrison, the director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, told me. China\u2019s alleged official death count, for example\u20145,259 as of January 4\u2014seems way too low to be believable, especially amid reports of overflowing Chinese hospitals and funeral homes. So long as the country isn\u2019t more forthcoming, Morrison said, then Chinese tourists, who have only recently been allowed to travel internationally, will continue to be unwelcome.\n\nExpressing this message through a largely pointless public-health measure comes with a price. When that measure fails to keep COVID spread at bay, faith in public-health institutions could decline, which Pagel said is the \u201cbiggest danger\u201d for the next pandemic. It also stokes the long-standing fear that Chinese people are more likely to carry disease than anyone else, whether foreign or American. \u201cWe are watching this policy so carefully to see if it will once again invite a racial backlash,\u201d Manjusha Kulkarni, a co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate, told me. If a rise in anti-Asian hate and violence comes along with more transparency from China about its COVID situation, the cost of these restrictions hardly seems worth their benefits.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Since the early 20th century, American companies have been owned and operated by individuals, giving them the power to make decisions on behalf of their shareholders. But in recent years there has emerged a new type of investor that is making waves in the corporate world. So-called private equity firms, hedge funds and venture capital firms are buying shares in publicly traded companies for the purpose of profit. These companies force companies to share a large part of their profits each year, sometimes as much as 90%. Blackstone Group, one of the world's largest private equity firms with more than $567 billion in assets under management, is known for its aggressive strategy to acquire businesses and extract value from them. Blackstone usually buys shares in a company, but does not control it, instead playing a passive role and forcing the company to improve its performance. This often involves cutting costs, restructuring debt, and stripping off unprofitable sectors. Once Blackstone is convinced that the company's performance has reached an acceptable level, it will seek cash investment. It then typically asks the company to pay investors at least 90% of its profits each year. In recent years, this type of investment has come under increasing scrutiny because it offers investors a quick return on investment and allows them to leave with large profits, while companies are in a weak position to invest in new projects or reinvest their own business. Critics argue that this type of investment is short-sighted and jeopardizes long-term economic growth and job creation. They argue that these investments are hampering U.S. economic growth because companies cannot invest in new projects or hire new workers. Some companies have begun to take a more shareholder-friendly approach in response to these protests, and they are taking steps to ensure that their profits are reinvested back into the business, not just for investors. Companies like Apple and Microsoft have begun to focus on long-term shareholder returns rather than short-term gains. They are reinvesting profits in research and development, and providing employees with competitive salaries and benefits. These companies take a long-term view and reinvest in their business, which demonstrates that there is a way for businesses to balance the interests of investors and stakeholders.These companies prove that profitability and long-term sustainability are possible. As the corporate landscape continues to change, companies must be aware of the potential risks of providing excessive profits to investors. Companies must find a balance that rewards shareholders while creating value for employees, customers and the economy.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Inflation burned consumers in 2022. Prices rose faster than wages, on average, eroding the typical shopper\u2019s purchasing power. Some things got so expensive buyers simply gave up.\n\nConsumers ought to get some revenge in 2023. Overall inflation has been slowing, from a peak of 9% in June to 7.1% in November. In coming months, there should be disinflation, or a declining rate of inflation, in many categories of goods and services. In some categories there will be deflation, or an outright drop in price levels. In the charts below, these trends show up as a declining rate of year-over-year inflation toward the end of 2022. By the end of 2023, many and perhaps all of those charts will show negative year-over-year inflation, or deflation. Here\u2019s where to watch for important price declines:\n\nReal estate. Forlorn buyers priced out of the housing market during the last two years may perk up in 2023. Home prices have already started to fall on a month-to-month basis, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller index and a variety of other indicators. The Case-Shiller index peaked in June and has since fallen four months in a row, with October prices the latest available. The reasons are well understood. Spiking mortgage rates, driven by the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest-rate hikes, have slashed housing affordability and driven buyers to the sidelines. Crumbling demand has started to bring prices down from the record highs of the COVID pandemic.\n\nSince real-estate repricing has just begun, it could go on for a while. It\u2019s very unlikely home prices will crash as they did after the 2003-2006 housing bubble, when average prices fell by 27% nationally \u2014 and by more in the frothiest regions. But prices have only fallen 3% so far, after a 26% spike from the start of the COVID pandemic to the peak in June. If home prices fell back to the pre-COVID trendline, that would be a drop of 10% or a bit more from current levels, which seems plausible.\n\nThe Fed is likely to slow and then halt its pace of interest rates hikes in 2023, which should allow home prices to stabilize at some lower level. At that point, it would take declining mortgage rates to boost affordability. Some forecasters think rates will be slightly below current levels by the end of the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.\n\nRent. Like real-estate prices, rents are likely to drop as rising interest rates cool demand for property. The Zillow observed-rent index has already dropped for two consecutive months, from September through November. This also seems likely to continue. Rents are still about 25% higher than pre-COVID levels, yet they\u2019ve only fallen by about half-a-percentage point from the 2022 peak. A return to pre-COVID trends implies a further decline of 10% or so. Many renters won\u2019t benefit until they sign a new lease, since rents are normally set for the length of the contract. But the worst of the pain may be over for people who haven\u2019t been able to buy during the last few years and then got stuck paying rent that\u2019s risen by double-digits.\n\n[Follow Rick Newman on Twitter, sign up for his newsletter or sound off.]\n\nCars. The inflation rate for new vehicles peaked at 13% in April 2022. For used cars, it peaked at an insane 41% last February. A semiconductor shortage drove soaring car prices, with manufacturers unable to finish building millions of new cars and frustrated buyers switching to used. The average price of a new vehicle soared to nearly $49,000 during the pandemic, according to Kelley Blue Book. Savvy buyers know how to haggle at the dealership, yet buyers have paid more than the sticker price every single month since January 2021.\n\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.\n\nThis won\u2019t last. The semi shortage is now easing. There\u2019s still pent-up demand for new cars, which means sales could stay strong during the first half of 2023, with prices moderating but not declining. By the second half of the year, however, there could be a glut of new cars, with prices falling back to more normal levels. Used-car prices will fall faster, and by more. Government inflation data show that used-vehicle prices are already 3% lower than a year ago, with bigger declines expected in coming months. Rising rates are denting used-car sales in particular, and repossessions could rise if there\u2019s a recession in 2023, as many economists expect. By the end of the year, used cars could be a fantastic bargain. Rental-car prices could drop this year as well, for similar reasons.\n\nAppliances. These require semiconductors, too, and at the beginning of 2022, shortages pushed the inflation rate for appliances to nearly 9% on a year-over-year basis. Appliance prices moderated toward the end of 2022 and could start to turn negative in 2023.\n\nElectronics. The price of computers, smartphones, and other gizmos normally declines over time, since ongoing gains in computing power consistently produce more bang for the buck. The chip shortage, combined with the work-from-home boom and a surge in demand for gear, pushed the cost of electronics slightly higher at the beginning of 2022. But that trend has now reversed, and drooping demand in 2023 could mean great deals on many tech products.\n\nHotel rooms. The cost of a hotel stay soared as the economy reopened in 2021 and 2022, and the lodging industry struggled to keep up with demand and rehire enough people. Those problems are now largely solved, with prices falling back in line. If there\u2019s a 2023 recession, watch for price cuts. Don\u2019t expect the same for airfares, however. Pilot shortages prevent airlines from putting more planes in the sky and jet fuel costs could stay high indefinitely.\n\nTwo wild cards. Food and energy costs may continue to strain family budgets and keep overall inflation above the Federal Reserve\u2019s target of 2% or so. Food inflation got worse, not better, during the last six months of 2022, and that could continue. Diesel fuel is unusually scarce, raising the cost of operating farm machinery and transporting food. High fertilizer costs are also pushing food prices up, and that\u2019s due in part to a disruption in fertilizer components from Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus, due to the Russian war in Ukraine.\n\nConsumers have gotten a break recently on some forms of energy, with gasoline prices down 35% from the peak in June and essentially unchanged from a year ago. But natural gas prices have been up for most of the year, pushing heating and electricity costs higher, since utilities that use gas normally lock in prices ahead of time. Global energy markets remain tight, which means a small increase in demand from anywhere could push prices up everywhere. That boost in demand could very well come from China, as it reopens following months of strict COVID lockdowns. Tightening sanctions on Russia could also affect energy supplies, especially if Russian President Vladimir Putin decides to cut exports of oil and gas. But there\u2019s always volatility somewhere, and price hikes in some things in 2023 will be offset by price cuts elsewhere.\n\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

The attacks followed a barrage of more than 20 cruise missiles fired across Ukraine on Saturday - and many bombardments earlier.\n\nAs the war drags into its 11th month, Moscow was unprepared for the staunch resistance and billions of dollars in Western weapons that have turned the tide in Ukraine's favour.\n\nRussian troops have been forced out of more than half the territory they took in the first weeks of what Putin calls a \"special military operation\" to \"denazify\" and demilitarise Ukraine. Kyiv and Western allies say Putin's invasion was a land grab.\n\n'FATE OF RUSSIA'\n\nPutin, breaking with tradition by delivering the New Year message flanked by troops rather than the Kremlin's walls, talked sternly and combatively about 2022 as the year that \"clearly separated courage and heroism from betrayal and cowardice.\"\n\nWhile trying to rally support among Russians amid embarrassing battlefield setbacks and growing internal criticism of his military strategy, Putin thanked Russian troops, but he also demanded more from them.\n\n\"The main thing is the fate of Russia,\" Putin, dressed in a dark suit and tie, said. \"Defence of the fatherland is our sacred duty to our ancestors and descendants. Moral, historical righteousness is on our side.\"\n\nRussia had planned a swift operation, but with the war dragging on it has been forced to put society on more of a war footing: calling up more than 300,000 reservists, retooling an economy hurt by Western sanctions and saying publicly that the conflict may be long.\n\nReiterating that the West is supposedly intent on \"destroying Russia\" by using Kyiv, Putin vowed he will never allow that. He signalled once again, that the war, albeit hard, will continue.\n\n\"We have always known, and today we are again convinced that the sovereign, independent, secure future of Russia depends only on us, on our strength and will,\" he said.\n\nANNEXED\n\nZelenskiy promised the return of lands Moscow proclaimed it had annexed in September.\n\n\"It's impossible to forget. And it's impossible to forgive. But it's possible to win,\" he said.\n\nWhile listing Ukraine's successes, Zelenskiy referred to the Crimean Bridge, Moscow's symbol of the annexation of the peninsula that linked it with Russia and that was torn by an explosion in October.\n\nWhile Putin immediately blamed Kyiv for orchestrating the powerful blast, Ukraine had not previously claimed responsibility for it - or any other attacks inside Russia, since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion.\n\n\"This year has struck our hearts. We've cried out all the tears. We've shouted all the prayers,\" Zelenskiy said.\n\n\"We fight and will continue to fight. For the sake of the key word: 'victory'.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Jake Cordell, Nick Starkov, David Ljunggren and Sergiy Karazy; Writing in Melbourne by Lidia Kelly; Editing by Neil Fullick\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Ravens' John Harbaugh on Lamar Jackson\u2019s return: 'I\u2019m just probably going to leave all that stuff alone and focus on the game'\n\nBaltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson missed his 13th straight practice on Wednesday and head coach John Harbaugh opted not to give updates on his status as the team prepares to face the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday in the regular-season finale.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just probably going to leave all that stuff alone and focus on the game and just be ready to coach our guys and have our guys ready for the game,\u201d Harbaugh said Wednesday when asked if Jackson would be ready for the postseason.\n\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.\n\nOn Dec. 4, Jackson left a game against the Denver Broncos early in the second quarter with a knee injury and was later ruled out.\n\nHarbaugh told reporters that the injury, later confirmed to be a PCL sprain, would leave Jackson out for \u201cdays to weeks,\u201d but wouldn\u2019t be season ending.\n\nTwo days later, fans got what seemed to be confirmation that Jackson could return soon, after ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter reported that Jackson\u2019s injury would sideline him for \u201c1-to-3 weeks.\u201d\n\nThen, the outlook appeared to change when The Baltimore Sun reported Jackson's recovery timeline to be \u201cwithin the four-to six-week recovery window as far as team trainers and physicians are concerned, according to a league source.\u201d\n\nNow, exactly a month after Jackson went down, Harbaugh seems annoyed about giving updates on the quarterback's status.\n\nThe Ravens clinched a playoff berth in Week 16 and it\u2019s possible Harbaugh is simply frustrated by the circumstances. Jackson was playing at an MVP-candidate level in October. Having a quarterback of that caliber unavailable for the most important part of the season definitely isn\u2019t ideal.\n\nThe Ravens are 2-2 in Jackson\u2019s absence. The team\u2019s Week 15 loss to the Cleveland Browns, especially, showcased the need for Jackson\u2019s return.\n\nHowever, Harbaugh and the Ravens\u2019 choice not to confirm that Jackson\u2019s recovery is taking longer than expected is strange. The confusion grows when Harbaugh\u2019s response is viewed from the lens of Jackson\u2019s contract situation, which took center stage in most discussions about the Ravens when he reportedly turned down an estimated $250 million offer from the team before the season.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Ravens can still use the franchise tag on Jackson this offseason, but there is likely to be tension over that if Jackson doesn't get a long-term extension.\n\nRegardless of this season not going the way Jackson may have hoped, the 25-year-old would likely still attract a ton of interest as a free agent or in a trade.", "label": "human"}
{"text": ".. After a historic bull market in the first half, both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were their best years since the Great Depression of 2008. Despite major economic events such as the US-China trade war and political unrest in Washington, stocks continued to rise for the rest of the year. Major indices have grown strongly since this year, and even occasional downturns continue to climb. The S&P 500 has risen by more than 20% in the first six months, as does the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The U.S. Congress passed several relief bills in 2020 and early 2021, providing more than $4 trillion in economic relief. The Federal Reserve has also cut interest rates many times to make money cheaper for businesses and consumers. Industries such as technology, biotechnology and banking have all made huge gains from the market because investors are betting on economic recovery and emerging thriving new industries. For example, the tech sector has grown by about 37% this year. Increasing demand for products and services from new technology-driven businesses has also helped tech stocks. There has also been an increase in demand for products like laptops, tablets, and mobile phones, as well as streaming services and cloud computing. In addition to technology stocks, the healthcare sector is also one of the best performing industries in 2022. As demand for medical products and services continues to rise, companies in this sector continue to benefit from the epidemic. The stock market's rise has also led to soaring house prices, with the national average home sales price in the first half at an all-time high. A booming housing market can be attributed to low interest rates, increased consumer confidence and rising wages. Overall, stock market performance in 2022 is a positive sign that the economy is continuing to recover from the 2020 pandemic recession. While there have been some slight swings throughout the year, markets are largely resilient, as evidenced by strong growth in major indices. As investors look ahead to the rest of the year, most experts are cautiously optimistic. The continued economic recovery and growing demand for products and services from emerging tech companies signal that stocks will continue to grow.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "MEXICO CITY (AP) - Scenes of flames and thick black smoke from natural spring wells attracted hundreds of protesters on Tuesday to the outskirts of Mexico City, which experts believe is the first reported case of burning water in Mexico. Residents of the indigenous community Cuajimoloyas, about 120 miles south of Mexico City, woke up Tuesday morning to find their main source of water was a hand-push well that had been swallowed by fire and smoked. \"It's like something in a horror movie,\" said Yolanda Gonzalez, who first saw the flame shortly after sunrise. \"The flame reaches at least 8 feet in the air and you can smell the gas in it.\" Local authorities believe that the well was deliberately set ablaze, and some residents pointed their finger at nearby local oil and gas companies. \"We've had problems with these companies in the past, and I'm sure they have something to do with it,\" said Gonzalez. \"They don't care about us or our environment, they only care about money.\" However, other locals say the well may have caught fire from natural causes, such as underground gas bags. Burning wells highlight Mexico's ongoing water crisis, particularly since the country began to suffer from a prolonged drought in the early 1920s. In rural areas like Cuajimoloyas, access to clean and safe water is often limited to wells, some of which are more than 100 years old. As news of the well spread across Mexico, protests followed. Hundreds of students and activists showed up at the site, many of them shouting slogans like \"Water belongs to the people\"! The crowd stayed in the area until late into the night, despite local authorities preventing the well from being knocked out. The federal government has pledged to investigate the causes of the fires and take steps to ensure that similar incidents are prevented in the future. But environmental experts warn that water pollution remains a serious threat, especially as Mexico's oil and gas industry continues to grow. \"This is a clear reminder of the dangers posed by the oil and gas industry and its operations near water sources,\" said Carlos Fuentes, director of the Mexican Environmental Protection Association. \"Oil spills, chemical spills and other contaminants can put nearby wells and rivers at risk as well as place local communities at risk.\" Residents of Guajimoloyas have asked the government to do more to ensure their water supply is safe. \"This is our lifeblood,\" Gonzalez said, \"the government needs to do more to protect it. This is the least they can do.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "This is another time of year: the holiday season, with packages piled up on the doorsteps and airports crowded with passengers. But during this holiday season, major parcel and freight companies as well as airlines are warning of potentially significant delays. FedEx and United Parcel Service said on Thursday that holiday package delivery could be delayed due to increased expected shipments of the Covid-19, coupled with winter storms expected to hit much of the U.S. in the coming days. The storm is expected to hit parts of the Midwest, mid-Atlantic and north-eastern regions, potentially causing heavy snow, ice and strong winds. This could lead to disruptions in air operations as well as delivery of ground parcels. \"We're making sure we're at the peak of our service commitments to deliver packages on time,\" said James Anderson, a FedEx spokesman. \"We have several contingency plans in place and additional resources are being made available to our operational teams to ensure that our customers enjoy their holidays as happy and bright as possible.\" American Airlines cancelled more than 1,000 flights on Thursday, with Southwest Airways, United Airlines and JetBlue canceling more than 400 flights each as the storm approached. Delta said it expects to cancel about 550 flights on Friday, with many more likely to happen. \"The number and scale of expected cancellations will depend on the weather and how the storm evolves,\" said Alex Rabinowitz, a Delta spokesperson. \"We expect that the current winter storm will have an impact on operations over the weekend, especially in certain hubs and markets.\" The storm is likely to cause further trouble for cargo owners and freight forwards, with the company's aviation unit FederalExpress as well as UPS potentially affected. This could lead to a reduction in the capacity of commercial aircraft transporting packages, thus increasing the time it takes customers to receive goods. \"We don't expect any significant delays in ground operations,\" said UPS spokesman Steve Gaut, adding: \"As far as air transportation is concerned, the anticipated winter storm could affect airlift capacity.\" Gault said UPS is preparing for the storm and has plans in place to minimize service disruptions, but he said it's too early to know exactly how much impact the storm will have on delivery. Meanwhile, FedEx spokesman Anderson said the company is monitoring weather conditions and ready to adjust its delivery process as needed. \"We are committed to delivering holidays as smoothly as possible, and we will be ready to adjust our processes so that customers can get their gifts, cards and other packages as quickly as possible,\" said Anderson. As for airlines, if the weather is severe enough, many airlines allow customers to change their flight plans without penalty. If a flight is affected by a storm, this may give passengers some breathing space. \"Our mission is to ensure that our customers reach their destinations safely and healthily, and airlines are doing everything they can to achieve this,\" said Rabinowitz of Delta Airways. But as the storm is expected to continue through the weekend, many travelers and holiday shoppers may have to prepare for possible delays.", "label": "machine"}

The party allows no direct criticism and imposes strict limits on free speech.\n\nThe company \"will continue to increase the investigation and cleanup of all kinds of illegal content, and create a harmonious and friendly community environment for the majority of users,\" Sina Weibo said in a statement dated Thursday.\n\nCriticism has largely focused on open-ended travel restrictions that saw people confined to their homes for weeks, sometimes without adequate food or medical care. Anger was also vented over the requirement that anyone who potentially tested positive or had been in contact with such a person be confined for observation in a field hospital, where overcrowding, poor food and hygiene were commonly cited.\n\nThe social and economic costs eventually prompted rare street protests in Beijing and other cities, possibly influencing the party's decision to swiftly ease the strictest measures.\n\nChina is now facing a surge in cases and hospitalizations in major cities and is bracing for a further spread into less developed areas with the start of the Lunar New Year travel rush, set to get underway in coming days. While international flights are still reduced, authorities say they expect domestic rail and air journeys will double over the same period last year, bringing overall numbers close to those of the 2019 holiday period before the pandemic hit.\n\nThe Transportation Ministry on Friday called on travelers to reduce trips and gatherings, particularly if they involve elderly people, pregnant women, small children and those with underlying conditions.\n\nPeople using public transport are also urged to wear masks and pay special attention to their health and personal hygiene, Vice Minister Xu Chengguang told reporters at a briefing.\n\nNonetheless, China is forging ahead with a plan to end mandatory quarantines for people arriving from abroad beginning on Sunday.\n\nBeijing also plans to drop a requirement for students at city schools to have a negative COVID-19 test to enter campus when classes resume Feb. 13 after the holiday break. While schools will be allowed to move classes online in the event of new outbreaks, they must return to in-person instruction as soon as possible, the city education bureau said in a statement Friday.\n\nHowever, the end to mass testing, a highly limited amount of basic data such as the number of deaths, infections and severe cases, and the potential emergence of new variants have prompted governments elsewhere to institute virus testing requirements for travelers from China.\n\nThe World Health Organization has also expressed concern about the lack of data from China, while the U.S. is requiring a negative test result for travelers from China within 48 hours of departure.\n\nChinese health authorities publish a daily count of new cases, severe cases and deaths, but those numbers include only officially confirmed cases and use a very narrow definition of COVID-related deaths.\n\nAuthorities say that since the government ended compulsory testing and permitted people with mild symptoms to test themselves and convalesce at home, it can no longer provide a full picture of the state of the latest outbreak.\n\nOn Sunday, the National Health Commission reported 10,681 new domestic cases, bringing the country's total number of confirmed cases to 482,057. Three new deaths were also reported over the previous 24 hours, bringing the total to 5,267.\n\nThe numbers are a fraction of those announced by the U.S., which has put its death toll at more than 1 million among some 101 million cases.\n\nBut they're also much smaller than the estimates being released by some local governments. Zhejiang, a province on the east coast, said Tuesday it was seeing about 1 million new cases a day.\n\nChina has said the testing requirements being imposed by foreign governments \u2014 most recently Germany and Sweden \u2014 aren't science-based and has threatened unspecified countermeasures. Its spokespeople have said the situation is under control, and reject accusations of a lack of preparation for reopening.\n\nIf a variant emerges in an outbreak, it is found through genetic sequencing of the virus.\n\nSince the pandemic started, China has shared 4,144 sequences with GISAID, a global platform for coronavirus data. That's only 0.04% of its reported number of cases \u2014 a rate more than 100 times less than the United States and nearly four times less than neighboring Mongolia.\n\nMeanwhile, Hong Kong also plans to reopen some of its border crossings with mainland China on Sunday and allow tens of thousands of people to cross every day without being quarantined.\n\nThe semi-autonomous southern Chinese city has been hard-hit by the virus and its land and sea border checkpoints with the mainland have been largely closed for almost three years. Despite the risk, the reopening is expected to provide a much-needed boost to Hong Kong's tourism and retail sectors.", "label": "human"}
{"text": ".. TEHRAN (Reuters) - Israel's central bank on Thursday raised its main interest rate for more than three years and said it would seek fiscal restraint from the government in the coming months. Bank of Israel, led by Bank of Israel Governor Amir Yaron, raised its benchmark rate from 0.10% to 0.25%, a move widely expected. This decision marks the first hike since 2016. \"The decision to raise interest rates is aimed at ensuring that inflation stays close to the target and enables monetary policy to take preemptive action and continue to support economic growth over time,\" Aaron said in a statement. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and opposition leader Benny Gantz both scrambled to form a governing coalition after the last national election in March. The two sides have so far failed to agree on forming a government, opening up the possibility of another election this summer. Mr Aaron said the government's fiscal policy must be cautious and prudent, even in the face of uncertain economic growth and high debt levels. \"This policy will continue to be carried out on the basis of prudent and prudent fiscal policies in order to promote growth, stability and increase employment,\" he said. Aaron has been critical of Netanyahu's expansionary fiscal policies in recent years, warning that this could lead to high levels of government debt. The central bank's governor said the government must also pursue structural reforms, including labor markets, to open up the economy to competition and promote competition in order to achieve maximum growth. The Israeli economy grew 3.3 percent in 2019, well above the average of advanced economies, and is expected to grow 4.2 percent by 2020, although the government budget deficit is expected to reach 5 percent of GDP. The Bank of Israel raised its 2020 growth forecast to 3.4% from 3.3% in March, but lowered its 2021 forecast to 3.5% from 4.1%. Aaron said it was important to manage the economy prudently in the \"complex and volatile environment\" of the coronavirus crisis, as well as amid possible changes in government. \"The macroeconomic environment has changed significantly, and the responsibility and challenge of public policy today is how to get out of the crisis and promote growth,\" he said. In addition to raising key interest rates, the Bank of Israel has said it will extend its credit-easing program for one year until mid-2024 and expand its scope to include small businesses. The World Bank has also announced a plan to increase liquidity in local debt markets, as well as a special plan to support small and medium-sized enterprises during the coronavirus crisis. The bank also said it would buy government bonds in the secondary market for up to 10 billion shekels ($2.87 billion) in the coming months. Bank of Israel took a number of steps to support the economy during the crisis, including two reductions in benchmark interest rates since the outbreak began and the launch of an emergency bond purchase program. The central bank also supports the government to help the economy by extending credit easing programs, reducing restrictions on buying government bonds and taking steps to support banks and increase liquidity.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Once considered the stuff of science fiction, Bank of America says self-driving cars now have \"real-world visibility.\" The \"feasibility\" of autonomous vehicles has risen significantly in the past decade, thanks to a \"multi-billion investment cycle\"; 5G networks; advancements in big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning; and a more conducive regulatory environment, Bank of America's Justin Post said in a note on Dec. 8. He added that full autonomous capabilities will take some time to be developed, but the groundwork is being laid with \"Level Four\" autonomy \u2014 largely seen as the final stage of development before a vehicle becomes fully autonomous. The bank said it expects 2.2 million autonomous vehicles to be on the roads by 2028, citing research by consultancy firm Berg Insights. In November, UBS estimated that China's autonomous driving-related market could reach $100 billion by 2030 . Internet companies Bank of America said this ramp-up in autonomous vehicles has \"broad implications\" for internet companies. \"Alphabet 's Waymo is expected to be a key supplier of AV technology and potential mobility competitor while Uber , Lyft and even DoorDash are likely to integrate AVs into their networks to reduce driver costs,\" Post said. \"Simultaneously, Amazon , Walmart , UPS , and others, are expected to modernize supply chain logistics with autonomous trucking,\" he added. Bank of America estimates that Amazon could enjoy up to $4.5 billion in cost savings if it used autonomous vehicles for delivery now, and more could be saved as volumes grow. The bank has a price target of $137 on Amazon, which represents a 53.9% potential upside to its closing price on Dec. 9. Ride-hailing firms Uber and Lyft could benefit from lower operating costs per mile, according to Bank of America's forecasts, although the cost savings are expected to be significantly lower than Amazon's. The bank added that getting the cost of autonomous vehicles down to the level of conventional autos will be key to their transition. Bank of America has a price target of $43 on Uber, giving the stock potential upside of 59.3%. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un issued an ultimatum on Tuesday calling for a substantial increase in the country's nuclear arsenal. \"We must increase the number of nuclear weapons we have, I mean exponentially,\" Kim said at a plenary meeting of the ruling North Korean Workers' Party. \"This is critical to protecting our country and its future.\" He noted that US-led coalitions such as Japan and South Korea are building their own nuclear arsenals, a threat that is growing. \"We have to be able to match them in terms of scale and capabilities,\" he said. Kim's call for a nuclear arsenal is nothing new, as North Korea has been pushing aggressive weapons since 2017. But his warning has a special weight, as the United States is negotiating with North Korea over its nuclear program. The United States is pushing for the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, which Kim has repeatedly refused to do, saying only concessions can be made by the United States. The United States has also called on North Korea to drastically reduce its nuclear weapons, a demand that Kim has so far rejected. In his speech, Kim spoke of the talks, saying that the United States needs to come up with \"concrete and meaningful steps\" before any compromise is made by North Korea. \"The United States must make sufficient efforts to provide North Korea with the security assurances it needs before any action can be taken to reduce its nuclear arsenal,\" he said. In response, the U.S. State Department said in a statement that it \"remains committed to finding a peaceful diplomatic solution to the North Korean nuclear issue.\" \"Our goal remains the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula in a verifiable and irreversible manner,\" it said. It also said the United States would not negotiate with North Korea until it took \"concrete steps\" to reduce its nuclear arsenal. South Korea also responded, with the foreign ministry expressing \"serious concern\" over North Korea's call for an increase in its nuclear arsenal. The ministry urged North Korea to \"immediately stop any development or acquisition of nuclear weapons\" and return to the negotiating table. But Kim has shown no signs of concession, vowing that whatever the United States does, he will seek to strengthen North Korea's nuclear arsenal. \"We will continue to take the necessary steps to ensure that we have established sufficient nuclear deterrents against aggressors,\" he said. Kim also hinted at a possible military build-up, saying the military must be prepared to protect the country from threats. \"The military must remain vigilant and ready to carry out its responsibility to protect our beloved country,\" he said. North Korea has been conducting a series of military exercises in recent months as tensions between the United States and North Korea remain high. Since the talks broke down in February 2019, there have been no negotiations between the United States and North Korea. Since then, the United States has been imposing severe economic sanctions on North Korea to force the regime to abandon its nuclear program. But so far, Kim has remained stubborn and his latest comments suggest he is not giving up on his nuclear ambitions. The only way for the U.S. and North Korea to reach an agreement is for both sides to sit down and negotiate, something they have avoided over the past three years. As long as Kim continues to push for the expansion of North Korea's nuclear program, peace and security on the Korean peninsula will remain a distant dream.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "God of War fans, rejoice - the latest part of a big franchise is here, as it emerges with the possibility of a new generation of character dressing up. The game itself, known as the God of War Ragnarok, aims to bring Kratos back to the forefront of console gaming. As players look for adventure and challenges, they will be able to explore a vast world inspired by Nordic mythology. For those who want to dress up as Kratos and his family from the game, it means an opportunity to bring characters into life with all the new accessories, props and clothes in full Cosplay details. First of all, it is important to mention the variety of costumes that Kratos wears in the game. In the game, Kratos wears a long coat with a dark brown fur lining and gray accent, as well as a brown belt and a white T-shirt below. The shirt is covered with various tribal tattoos, which are Anger in Cosplay. The coat itself can be reproduced by a combination of leather and fur fabric, as well as various accessories such as belts and straps. It is best to copy the fur lining with fur fabric, or use a combination of brown and white fur fabric if more accurate appearance is required. T-shirts can be made of white fabric, tattoos can be reproduced using fabric markers, air brushes or iron patches. Other accessories, such as Kratos' iconic Spartan shield and sword can also be found in the clothing store. These props can be made from a variety of materials, such as plastic, wood or foam. Kratos is also wearing leather gloves on his left arm, which can be copied using leather fabric or artificial leather fabric. His family can also play together, and his son Atrus has a complete set of clothes to copy. Atlus wears underwear made of green fur cloth, with belts and leather ropes. On the other hand, his iconic leather fixtures are best reproduced using Schud fabric because they are relatively crude in texture. In addition to a pair of leather gloves and a leather cap, these straps are essential for Atrous to look right. The world of the gods of war is filled with magical creatures, such as giant serpents of the world, and amulets can make their own amulets. A amulet requires a large piece of fabric for its body, various lines of fabric for its scale, and multiple moving parts for the head, tail and other body parts. For more ambitious amulets, an entire set of armor, such as Kratos \"or Atlas\", can also be made. God of War Ragnarok brings new characters and a new world, giving players around the world a whole new set of characters. With a variety of clothing, props and accessories to choose from, this is a great opportunity for players to express their creativity and show appreciation for the game in their own unique way.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "After a year of blockades and travel restrictions, Chinese travellers and tourists are looking forward to new freedom of movement due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Chinese government announced last week that it was relaxing travel restrictions, which means domestic and international tourism may soon return to normal. The Chinese government's move is good news for many of Asia's heavily affected tourist hotspots. Regional countries such as Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam, Japan and the Philippines have all reported a sharp decline in tourism since the outbreak began, but the new policy could mean an increase in visitor numbers. The relaxation of COVID-19 travel restrictions means that people from outside China will eventually be able to enter the country, sparking a new wave of enthusiasm among local and international tourism players. Tour operators, airlines and hotels have welcomed the news and are now preparing to significantly upgrade their operations. According to Chinese officials, Beijing and Shanghai will be the first cities open to international visitors, while other cities are expected to follow suit. As part of the new policy, tourists visiting China will be allowed to stay for up to a month. The Chinese government has also said that it will provide subsidies to tour operators who can attract and receive more foreign tourists, which has led to an increase in tourism investment and activity as businesses look to take advantage of this opportunity to attract more visitors. People who come to China must comply with strict health and safety regulations, including two weeks of quarantine and regular COVID-19 testing. Moreover, foreign tourists can only be allowed to visit certain parts of the country, they need to register online in order to visit. Still, many people are eager to see the tourism industry recover in the coming months. As the Chinese government continues to ease travel restrictions and take steps to promote its development, more people may be encouraged to take advantage of this opportunity to explore China. In Thailand, for example, the Ministry of Tourism encourages hotels and tour operators to be prepared to receive more visitors from China. Similarly, in Indonesia, the government reportedly offers more incentives to foreign tourists, including visas and hotel accommodation discounts. Meanwhile, Japan's government is preparing for a surge in Chinese tourism. Japanese officials say they are now ready to welcome more tourists from the mainland and have taken the necessary steps to ensure their safety. Overall, the Chinese government's relaxation of travel restrictions seems to be good news for Asia's tourism industry.

Robert Garcia\n\nA new Democratic member of Congress from California, who is the first out gay immigrant elected to the body, will be sworn in on a rare first-edition Superman comic, sentimental personal items, and the Constitution once Republicans manage to elect a new speaker of the House.\n\nRobert Garcia, who was mayor of Long Beach before November\u2019s election, announced on Tuesday that he would be sworn in with items of personal significance.\n\n\u201cWill be proudly sworn-in to Congress on the U.S. Constitution. Underneath the Constitution will be 3 items that mean a lot to me personally.

Most recently, days after his election, the incoming lawmaker tweeted his amazement at the collection of comic books in the Library of Congress collection.\n\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.\n\nIn November, he tweeted, \u201cOk y\u2019all I\u2019m freaking out. This is the Congressional members reading room in the Library of Congress. I can pull any comic book from what is the largest public comic collection in the country and read them here. Let\u2019s go!\u201d\n\nAlthough many lawmakers traditionally have brought a Bible to swearing-in ceremonies, there is no such requirement. In fact, the Constitution spells out in Article VI that \u201cno religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the comic book, Garcia will have his certification of citizenship and photos of his parents with him for the big moment.\n\nGarcia immigrated to the United States as a 5-year-old from Peru and subsequently earned his U.S. citizenship. Garcia\u2019s election is significant since he is the first immigrant who is also an out member of the LGBTQ+ community to join Congress.\n\nIn July 2020, while battling the COVID pandemic as the chief executive in Long Beach, Garcia lost his mother, a health care worker, to the virus. Then, in early August, his stepfather died of complications from the virus.\n\nStory continues\n\nGarcia is one of the new congressional Democrats who have made a splash in advance of their official assumption of office.\n\nMost notably, Garcia has his mind set on giving Georgia\u2019s far-right, anti-LGBTQ+ Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene a run for her money and has relentlessly trolled the extremist congresswoman.\n\nIn November, Garcia told The Advocate that as far as Greene is concerned, \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019s not going to like me very much.\u201d", "label": "human"}
{"text": ".. Dubai has just eliminated a 30% tax on alcohol - a move that could provide a huge boost to its hospitality industry. The decision was announced by the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President of the United Arab Emirates. The tax cut means that a bottle of wine, which used to cost Dh230 ($62.80) in the city, will now cost Dh163 ($44.50) - an effective savings of Dh67 ($18.30) per bottle. Sheikh Mohammed said in a statement: \"We are working to reduce the cost of living for UAE citizens, expatriates and tourists, including taxes that people have to pay for goods and services. The tax cuts will take effect immediately and will apply to all alcohol purchased in Dubai stores and supermarkets.Restaurants, bars and hotels will also benefit as they are able to pass on the saved costs to customers. The move is expected to have a positive impact on the hospitality industry, which has been hit hard by the global epidemic. The Dubai Department of Tourism and Business Marketing (DTCM) said in a tweet that the tax cuts \"are expected to contribute to the long-term recovery of the hospitality industry\" and \"improve its competitiveness in the global market.\" A DTCM spokesperson said: \"Dubai is one of the most sought after destinations for tourists and visitors around the world, in a move designed to ensure they get the best possible experience in the city. Mohammed Juma Bin Driq, chairman of the Dubai Economic Council, said that reducing alcohol taxes would \"help hotels and tourism by providing them with a competitive edge and encouraging tourists to come to Dubai.\" \"This is part of our overall strategy to strengthen the UAE economy and make it more competitive, which is a welcome development,\" he said. This is not the first time that Dubai has taken such measures. Last year, in order to revive its tourism industry, it cut taxes on hotel accommodation, car rental and private yacht chartering. The city also announced plans to spend AED 47 billion ($12.85 billion) on stimulus programs to help businesses deal with the economic impact of Covid-19. Dubai also attracts new businesses and investors by offering tax incentives and other benefits, such as free office space and discounted electricity bills. The city hopes its latest moves will help boost its hospitality industry, attract more visitors to the city and pave the way for a strong recovery in the coming years.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".. On Monday, Barclays downgraded Ally Financial Inc. from \"overweight\" to \"equivalent weight,\" amid concerns about the company's vulnerability in 2023. In a report to clients, Barclays Bank analyst Arun Melman said the Detroit-based bank was \"in a good position\" to benefit from improvements in the economic recovery, but that prospects for 2023 and beyond were less certain. \"Given the recent deterioration in credit prospects, and our belief that the economic recovery may be slower than initially anticipated, we believe Avery will be more vulnerable to adverse business conditions in 2023,\" Melman wrote. He added that Ally's \"solid capitalization\" would allow it to maintain its current credit rating, but pointed out that if the economic recovery slowed or there was another downturn, it would be at risk of a downgrade. In addition to the downgrade, Melman also lowered the bank's price target from $43 to $37, calling enhanced regulatory scrutiny a key risk. He said Ailey's high share of short-term debt and less liquid assets could make it a target for regulators. Analysts also noted that Ally's lending growth over the past year has outpaced industry peers, a trend that could lead to higher credit costs. He added that as the industry normalizes, Ally's higher loan growth may cause investors to reassess their risk tolerance. Despite these concerns, Melman said that Avery's \"positive\" operating environment and higher-than-peer loan growth should help it remain attractive to investors. He also noted that the bank's \"steady\" online deposit growth and low cost of capital could make it attractive to depositors, even with the possibility of further regulatory scrutiny. Overall, the analyst said that investors should take a \"cautious\" approach to Ally in light of increased uncertainty about the economic environment in 2023 and the risk of regulatory review. He added that before making long-term commitments, investors should look for signs of improving their operating environment. In response to the downgrade, Ally's stock fell 2.3% on Monday morning trading and has already lost 13% in the past three months. The downgrade comes after a turbulent period in which banks faced the adverse effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier this year, Unilever was forced to lay off more than 1,600 employees, and its profits fell by 24% in the third quarter due to an increase in loan loss reserves. Despite the challenges, Ally continued to maintain strong lending and deposit growth. The bank reported a 19% year-on-year increase in loans during the third quarter, with deposits increasing by 24%. While the company has successfully weathered the pandemic, it is likely to continue under pressure as the economy recovers in 2023. Given the new Barclays downgrade, investors should be cautious about stocks.", "label": "machine"}

Skydance Media, the film studio behind \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" counts RedBird as an investor. CEO and founder Gerry Cardinale has been in the New York Yankees' corner for 20 years, helping the baseball team form its regional sports network, YES, sell a 49% stake at a valuation of more than $3 billion, and buy it back.\n\nBut behind the scenes, RedBird is quietly building a financial services arm, investing more than $1 billion in the past four years, according to a source familiar with the firm. A quarter of the $7.5 billion firm's business comes from asset management and insurance. Finance bets include MainStreet Advisors, Paul Wachter's investment and financial advisory firm known for boldface-name clients like NBA star LeBron James, as well as asset manager Aquarian.\n\nRedBird has raised close to $2.5 billion over the past 12 months, and is already deploying capital from its fourth fund to execute roll-up mergers in financial services, the source added. The fund is expected to close by midyear 2023.\n\nThe firm's philosophies for financial services and sports are one and the same: taking advantage of fragmented environments with firms that have long-term recurring cash flow. But RedBird doesn't have the same cache in financial services that it does in sports, so Cardinale is willing to acquire smaller firms and go to \"hand-to-hand combat.\"\n\n\"At our core, we are grinders,\" Cardinale told Insider. \"It's a lot of bottoms-up and top-down work. But that's the way our firm is set up. Don't be fooled by the sizzle of 'Top Gun' and the sports stuff. It's all the same thing.\"\n\nThis past summer RedBird poached Alex. Brown president Haig Ariyan, who presided over its sale to Raymond James from Deutsche Bank, to build out a new asset and wealth manager, Arax Investment Partners.\n\nThe firm has already had a major win with its buy-and-build strategy. It bought nine specialty insurance brokers over two years to build Constellation, which it sold to Truist for more than $900 million in 2021.\n\nRedBird has also made growth equity investments in fintech and insurance tech startups such as Covered Insurance Solutions, a digital marketplace for homeowners insurance, according to the source.\n\nThe rise of sports investing\n\nDiversifying away from sports and media is a good move for RedBird, said Don Gogel, the chairman of the private-equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice. Sports investing, in particular, is awash in private equity capital with firms spending $51 billion on sports transactions last year, according to PitchBook. Despite harbingers of an economic downturn, valuations are soaring, and many professional sports teams are up for sale, including soccer clubs Liverpool, Manchester United, and Paris Saint-Germain.\n\n\"There's a lot of capital that gets invested in sports. It's an attractive area that people think they know something about \u2014 whether they do or don't,\" said Gogel.\n\nCardinale, who started investing in sports at Goldman Sachs, is also cautious about this the influx of new investors.\n\n\"People need to calm down a little bit about sports,\" he said. \"This euphoria around sports scares me because it suggests a bubble environment and a caveat to beware.\"", "label": "human"}
{"text": "One of the most prominent figures in the cryptocurrency industry, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), is about to be charged with fraud related to a trading platform called FTX. Bankman-Fried, CEO of Alameda Research and founder and CEO of FOX, is expected to plead not guilty to the charges in the coming weeks. The allegations stem from the U.S. Department of Justice's ongoing investigation into Bankman-Fried's alleged involvement in FTX fraud, a derivative and cryptocurrency exchange that has been operating since 2019. Bankman-Fried is accused of engaging in fraudulent activities related to the platform's trading services, including price manipulation and reshuffle transactions. The charges against Bankman-Fried are serious, and if found guilty, he could face up to 10 years in prison and a possible fine of $250,000 or more. Given the high profile of the defendants, the Justice Department is not expected to show leniency in the case. The news has shocked the crypto community, which has been surrounding Bankman-Fried ever since its rise. While many are skeptical of the allegations, some believe they may be more serious than what initially appeared.The cryptocurrency industry is a rapidly evolving industry and bankers-Fried may violate certain regulations or laws relating to the trading services it provides. The case against Bankman-Fried is likely to develop rapidly, as the Justice Department is expected to file charges in the coming weeks. Bankman-Fried is expected to plead not guilty to the charges, and his legal team is already preparing for a rigorous defense.

Kennedy International Airport so they could manipulate the line and charge drivers for access to the front of the queue, federal prosecutors said Tuesday.\n\nDaniel Abayev and Peter Leyman, both 48, were taken into custody on Tuesday morning in Queens and charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, prosecutors from the Southern District of New York announced.\n\nBeginning in 2019, the two allegedly worked with hackers based in Russia to infiltrate JFK's taxi dispatch system by bribing someone to install malware on computers connected to the system, stealing computer tablets and using Wi-Fi to break in, prosecutors alleged.\n\n\"I know that the Pentagon is being hacked\u2026 so can't we hack the taxi industry[?]\" Abayev allegedly texted one of the hackers in November 2019, according to the indictment against him.\n\nOnce the hackers successfully gained access to the dispatch system, Abayev and Leyman were able to move specific taxis to the front of the line and began charging drivers $10 to skip the queue, prosecutors alleged.\n\nTypically, taxi drivers looking to pick up travelers at JFK wait in a holding lot before they're dispatched to a specific terminal in the order in which they arrived.

{"text": "Samsung Electronics Co Ltd will provide its fourth quarter earnings guidance on Tuesday, and analysts expect the South Korean tech giant to have lower operating margins during this period, dragged down by the price of storage chips. According to a Reuters survey of 35 analysts, Samsung, the world's largest smartphone, chip and flat-screen TV manufacturer, had an operating profit of 8.1 trillion won ($7.5 billion) in the October-December quarter, down 5 percent from 8.5 trillion won a year ago. The median forecast of 17 analysts is that the company will report an operating profit of 8.3 trillion won. That would be the lowest quarterly profit since the fourth quarter of 2017, when Samsung reported an operating profit of 7.4 trillion won. The consensus for operating income in the third quarter was 6.6 trillion won. One of the main reasons for the expected decline is the falling price of memory chips, which are a key source of profits for Samsung. For most of the year, especially in Q3, Samsung felt the impact of lower prices for storage chips. At the end of Q3, Samsung's operating profit fell 21.7% year-on-year, the largest quarterly decline since the beginning of 2017. Analysts said that the trend of lower chip prices in the fourth quarter is likely to continue, especially due to a slowdown in the global economy and weakening demand for switching from PCs and laptops. The good news is that the decline in profits is expected to be relatively small compared with the third quarter, partly due to a seasonal rally in the semiconductor sector. Analysts say the fourth quarter earnings guidance will be important because it will provide investors with an indication of potential trends in Samsung's chip sector. The outlook for Samsung's mobile division is expected to remain weak in the fourth quarter, as the market for high-end smartphones may remain sluggish. Analysts also said that the semiconductor sector, which accounts for a major portion of Samsung's overall operating profits, is facing challenges from Chinese manufacturers as well as US-China trade tensions. Samsung's mobile and semiconductor segments together account for about three quarters of its total operating profit. Investors will look for any signs of a recovery in the mobile and semiconductor sectors. They will also be keen to hear Samsung's views on the prospects for its display panel business, which has been weak due to falling prices of liquid crystal display (LCD) panels and increasing popularity of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels. The company is expected to provide earnings guidance on Tuesday, with a fourth-quarter earnings announcement on Jan. 30. Analysts said that while Samsung's fourth quarter earnings forecast may be disappointing, they remain confident in its long-term outlook and the company's ability to navigate the current business environment. Looking ahead, analysts expect the semiconductor market to improve under the global 5G rollout. In addition, Samsung is expected to benefit from strong demand for memory chips in data centers, which will help offset the decline in the personal computer sector. Analysts also said that Samsung may benefit from diversifying its product portfolio, with the company investing heavily in non-memory chips for 5G and AI applications. Analysts added that the company could also benefit from the launch of new 5G smartphones in 2020. Overall, analysts said that despite the headwinds in the fourth quarter, investors should be optimistic about Samsung's long-term outlook.", "label": "machine"}

The move could radically change urban transportation, as the two companies aim to start commercial operations by 2029. Founded in 2021 through the merger of PSA and Fiat Chrysler, Stellantis has a foothold in the future of the automotive world, owning shares in self-driving car company Waymo and an electric vehicle joint venture with French company Groupe PSA. Now, the company is turning its eyes to the sky by working with Archer.The two companies plan to develop electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft that can serve as air taxis on demand. The new service, called \"SkyTaxi,\" will provide passengers with reliable and affordable air travel that could revolutionize urban mobility by providing a faster and safer alternative to road travel. The project will draw on Stellantis' expertise in engineering, manufacturing and maintenance as well as Archer's experience in aerospace technology. The US company, founded in 2017, already has an impressive track record. It recently completed a successful test flight of its all-electric aircraft and recently raised more than $1 billion in funding. Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares said the partnership is a \"great opportunity\" for the company to enter the aerospace sector. \"At Stellanis, we firmly believe that in order to stay ahead of the automotive industry, we need to move beyond cars. We are excited to partner with Archer and explore new ways to make transportation safer, faster and more cost effective for everyone,\" Tavares said in a statement. The two companies plan to develop a range of aircraft, from single-person taxis to large planes that can accommodate up to 20 passengers. The aircraft will be powered by electric motors and batteries, a combination that the two companies say will allow them to reach speeds of up to 200 miles per hour. The two companies hope to launch the service in multiple cities, starting in Los Angeles in 2029. Archer CEO Brett Adcock praised the move as an important step forward for the aerospace industry. \"We're excited to be working with Stellaantis to create a whole new way to move people and goods,\" Adcock said. \"With SkyTaxi, we bring together two world-class companies to revolutionize urban mobility. We look forward to the future of faster, more affordable and more sustainable air travel.\" In addition to the partnership with Stellaantis, Archer also announced plans to establish a venture capital fund to support startups in the eVTOL sector. The company said the fund will invest in a variety of projects in the industry, from battery technology to autonomous flight systems. For its part, Stellantis plans to continue exploring the future of mobility and is planning to invest in new projects such as on-demand automated shuttles and air services. The car giant is well aware of the big changes in the future of the automotive industry, with electric vehicles and self-driving cars to dominate the market over the next few years.

{"text": "BANGKOK/SINGAPORE/SYDNEY, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Asian countries are bracing for an influx of Chinese tourists as COVID restrictions are dismantled, and while some are wary, operators in others are preparing packages such as hotpot buffets to cash in on the expected spike in travel.\n\nChinese tourists will no longer need to quarantine on return home starting Jan. 8, the government announced this week, a move that spurred a surge in bookings from what was the world's largest outbound travel market in 2019.\n\nThe once $255 billion a year in global spending by Chinese tourists ground to a virtual halt during the pandemic, leaving a gaping hole in the Asian market, where countries from Thailand to Japan had depended on China as the largest source of foreign visitors.\n\nInternational flights to and from China are at just 8% of pre-pandemic levels, VariFlight data shows, but carriers are looking to ramp up capacity as authorities ease COVID-driven limits on the number of flights.\n\n\"There is little doubt mainland Chinese are the spark plug for Thailand's tourism recovery,\" said Bill Barnett, managing director of hospitality consultancy C9 Hotelworks. \"It's not a question of if it will happen, it's now just a matter of how many and how fast.\"\n\nMalaysia Airlines and Vietnamese budget carrier VietJet Aviation (VJC.HM) said they hope to restore China flights to pre-pandemic levels by June 2023, while others such as Singapore Airlines (SIAL.SI) and Australia's Qantas Airways (QAN.AX) declined to provide detailed targets as the situation evolves.\n\nChinese airlines are likely to make significant increases to capacity from the end of March, coinciding with the start of the summer scheduling season, Morningstar analyst Cheng Weng told clients in a note.\n\nREBOUND \"WITH A VENGEANCE\"\n\nThe prospect of cash-rich Chinese flocking to shopping streets across the world boosted luxury stocks this week, as China accounts for 21% of the world's 350 billion euro ($371.91 billion) luxury goods market.\n\nAs the Lunar New Year holiday - typically a peak travel period for Chinese tourists - starts on Jan. 21, some businesses are already gearing up.\n\nSofitel Sentosa in Singapore is creating Lunar New Year packages aimed at Chinese visitors, including a hotpot buffet and romantic packages for couples, said Cavaliere Giovanni Viterale, general manager of that hotel and the upcoming Raffles Sentosa, as the company bets that a travel rebound will come \"with a vengeance\".\n\nIn Japan, tour bus firm Hato Bus says next month it will try out Chinese-language tours it had halted during the pandemic, with the aim of a full resumption by the spring, a spokesperson said.\n\nJapan, however, is being cautious about Chinese tourism due to the rapid spread of the virus in China. It is requiring a negative COVID-19 test on arrival from Chinese visitors, and those who test positive must quarantine for seven days under new border measures taking effect on Dec. 30.\n\nThe United States said it would impose mandatory COVID tests on travellers from China, joining India, Italy and Taiwan in taking new measures, while the Philippines is considering a testing requirement.\n\nAustralia, Germany, Thailand and others, however, said they would not impose additional rules on Chinese travel for now, with France taking to social media platform Sina Weibo to emphasise it welcomed Chinese friends \"with open arms\".\n\nIn Vietnam, where tourist visas for Chinese are not yet being issued, Saigon Halong Hotel in Halong Bay expects it will receive Chinese arrivals from the second quarter of next year.\n\nAny hopes of a massive rebound in Chinese travel to Australia during the Lunar New Year holiday are probably misplaced, James Shen, general manager of Melbourne-based tour agency Odyssey Travel said, citing sky-high airfares.\n\n\"There are still very few flights and they would be booking very last minute,\" he said. \"I suspect any meaningful rebound will have to wait until the travel boom in June or July next year.\"\n\n($1 = 0.9411 euros)\n\nAdditional reporting by Isabel Kua in Singapore, Mariko Katsumara in Tokyo, Francesco Guarascio and Khanh Vu in Hanoi, Neil Jerome Morales in Manila, Mei Mei Chu in Kuala Lumpur; Writing by Jamie Freed; Editing by Anne Marie Roantree and Gerry Doyle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The Japanese government announced Monday that, as a sign of the huge pressure on Tokyo's overcrowding, it will pay families to move from the capital to less populated areas. The incentive is part of the government's \"Tokyo Relocation\" program, aimed at easing the burden of overcrowding in Japan's largest city, which has a population of more than 9 million and is expected to reach 10 million by 2045. \"Tokyo is facing a serious problem of overcrowding, which is expected to only get worse in the coming years,\" Chief Cabinet Secretary Toshiro Takeda said at a press conference announcing the plan. \"The plan aims to address this issue by encouraging people to move to areas with more resources and space.\" Under the new plan, eligible families who agree to move to cities other than Tokyo will receive up to 3 million yen ($26,400) in moving and other expenses. The money will be paid in two instalments - one at the beginning of the move and the other after it is completed. These sums will be deposited into the family's bank account, which can be used to spend or further invest. Tokyo's relocation plan is part of a larger effort by the Japanese government to encourage people to leave the capital. In 2017, Japan launched its \"Regional Renewal\" program to provide funding for local governments that have developed plans to attract new residents. The idea is to address Japan's declining birth rate, which has been shrinking for decades and is now at an all-time low. The government hopes that by providing incentives to move people to more rural areas, it will help support the local economy and encourage more people to stay and start families. The plan also aims to ease the pressure on Tokyo's infrastructure and housing markets, which are overburdened by too many people living in the city. But some experts question the effectiveness of the relocation plan, saying it could have an unexpected \"brain drain\" effect - encouraging the most skilled workers to leave Tokyo and depriving the city of vital human capital. \"We need to be careful not to lose people who might have stayed in Tokyo,\" said Yuuki Suzuki, a professor of economics at the University of Tokyo. \"It's not just about getting people moving, it's about making policies that attract more people into the city.\" Others worry that the relocation plan could contribute to the expansion of Tokyo's massive metropolis. As people move from the capital to the suburbs, the government may be encouraging new housing and other infrastructure construction, which could exacerbate the city's problems. Nevertheless, the government remains optimistic that the relocation plan will help alleviate some of Tokyo's overcrowding problems and make it a more sustainable long-term place to live. \"We believe this plan will help reduce Tokyo's population density and create more opportunities for people to live better lives in other parts of the country,\" Takeda said.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "On December 23, 2022, the UK's largest mini-newspaper The Sun issued an apology to former editor Jeremy Clarkson for a provocative column about Margaret Meghan of Sussex. The column was widely criticized for its tone and inflammatory language, and the newspaper has also been pressured by its staff and activists to apologize and withdraw the column.In a statement released today, the paper said: The Sun apologizes unreservedly to the Duchess of Sussex for the tone and content of Jeremy Clarkson's column, which was published on December 13, 2022. We now understand that Mr Clarkson's comments in his column are offensive, hurtful, and wrong. We regret publishing the column and understand why it caused pain and harm. We sincerely apologize for our misjudgment as well as any injury or violation resulting from its publication. The apology came after criticism from staff and readers who described the column as \"evil and incendiary\" and \"racist.\" The column sparked a heated debate on social media, with many calling for the newspaper to apologize and withdraw the column. One user wrote: \"I am disgusted by Jeremy Clarkson's sun ugly and racist column about Megan. This is an example of racism that still plagues Britain today.\" In a statement, the celebrities wrote: \"As individuals with a shared commitment to equality and justice, we believe that the language and tone of Jeremy Clarkson's column on the Duchess of Sussex is unacceptable and offensive. We urge The Sun to immediately apologize and withdraw the column, and make an unequivocal commitment against all forms of racism and prejudice.\" The newspaper's editor Tony Gallagher initially defended the column, writing in a tweet that it was \"not racist\". However, he has since deviated from his own statement and issued an apology on behalf of the newspaper. The apology was welcomed by many, but far from enough for some. Meghan's supporters point out that the apology was only issued after a public protest, arguing that newspapers should take responsibility for the column and not be ashamed of it. The debate highlighted the need for a more responsible media, particularly with regard to reporting on minorities. It also sparked a debate about UK news regulation, which many argued needed stronger regulation to protect individuals from inflammatory and offensive language. After an apology, it remains to be seen what the Sun will do to ensure that similar events don't happen in the future. However, this debate reveals how racism and prejudice still exist in Britain, and more needs to be done by both the media and the public to challenge it.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "On a cold and dark Saturday in Atlanta, the Georgia Bulls showed why they should get the highest ranking by beating Ohio State Buckeyes 27-19 in their college football postseason semifinal match to secure a place at the CFP tournament. The Bulls, the second seed in the playoffs and also the highest ranked team in the game, started off strong and entered the locker room in midfield, leading 20-10. In the second half, Buckeyes defeated the Bulldogs 9-7. However, in the tank they had enough power to win a victory of 27-19 and get the right to compete in the championship. The Bulls were defensively dominated, forcing three transfers throughout the game and helping to keep the offense ahead of an attack at Ohio State University. Georgia was also able to rely on a strong defender D'Andre Swift to carry the weight, as he made two touchdowns and 137 yards in 22 attempts. As quarterback Jack Fromm struggled to find an open target, the Bulldog was unable to build a passing attack on Buckeyes and only passed 130 yards in 18 attempts without touching ground. However, the offensive line allowed Froome enough time to read the defense and keep his offense in front of Buckeyes. Although quarterback Justin Fields had some success in passing, he was held for 225 yards without touching the ground and three interceptions. The Ohio game could not be played either, with a ground attack of only 110 yards. There were some interesting moments in the game, with two Ohio goals in the second half being taken away by a penalty. While Buckeyes still played some games in the race, the defense of Georgia managed to maintain their lead, especially in the final minutes of the fourth quarter when their fourth match and goal stopped. In Miami's CFP Championship, the Bulls will face CFP's top seed, the Clemson Tigers. They beat the Oklahoma Clippers 37-17 in another half-final and will give the Bulls a tough game. Georgia needs to improve their passes in order to be able to keep up with Clemson's explosive offensive - led by Heisman trophy winner Trevor Lawrence. But with a defense as talented and experienced as a bulldog, they can still fight. It will be an exciting match, and fans can't wait to see the top two teams of college football face to face. The Bulls won a place in the championship game and will have the opportunity to prove that they are the best team in the country.", "label": "machine"}

The company has introduced RTX 40 GPUs for laptops that promise large leaps in performance, even in lower-end systems. The flagship RTX 4080 and 4090 GPUs are reportedly powerful enough to play games across three 4K monitors at 60 frames per second \u2014 you might not need a desktop to immerse yourself in a flight or racing sim.\n\nEven the mainstream GeForce RTX 4050, 4060 and 4070 chips are billed as faster than the outgoing RTX 3080. They're quick enough to deliver 1440p gaming at up to 80FPS, and are supposedly up to twice as fast as a PlayStation 5. They also make it more practical to handle pro tasks like 3D modelling and AI-based media editing on 14-inch laptops, according to NVIDIA.\n\nThe RTX 40 architecture is notoriously power-hungry on desktops, but NVIDIA claims it's keeping energy efficiency in check with the laptop variants. DLSS 3 AI upscaling is now optimized for mobile use, while finer-grained \"tri-speed\" memory control lets the GPU drop to lower-power RAM states. On-chip memory tweaks(such as doubled bandwidth) and low-voltage GDDR6 RAM also help wring the most out of the video hardware.\n\nTurn on browser notifications to receive breaking news alerts from Engadget You can disable notifications at any time in your settings menu.

{"text": "The announcement on Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin was sending a warship equipped with hypersonic cruise missiles to the Atlantic is alarming in both Europe and the United States. This is the latest in a series of aggressive and provocative actions by Russia over the past few months, including close contacts with NATO forces in the Black Sea and the deployment of nuclear missiles into Belarus. The Russian warship Admiral Gorshkov is an advanced missile frigate capable of launching various cruise missiles. According to the Russian Navy, Gorshkov possesses Kalib-NK and Zircon hypersonic cruise missiles that fly at speeds as high as Mach 9, or about nine times the speed of sound. The move has heightened tensions between Russia and the United States and its allies, particularly in the Baltic region. It is expected that Russian frigates will enter the North Atlantic through the Danish Strait, within the impact range of the eastern coast of the United States. In response to this development, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg issued a statement calling on Russia to respect international law and refrain from provocative actions. He also urged Russia to \"stop further destabilizing acts\" and continue its \"constructive dialogue\" with NATO and other international partners. The Pentagon also issued a statement condemning the move as a \"dangerous escalation\" and expressing deep concern about Russia's \"continuance of violations of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty,\" a Cold War-era agreement that the United States and Russia have been accusing each other of over the past few months. The move was strongly echoed by NATO members and international experts, who warned it could lead to a dangerous escalation of tensions between the two nuclear superpowers. However, some observers see the move as part of a carefully orchestrated effort by the Russian government to show its discontent with the recent policies of the United States and its allies. There are also reports that the frigate will be joined by two other Russian warships. It is not clear whether they are equipped with the same type of hypersonic cruise missiles, but it is possible to use them in a similar way. Currently, the United States and its allies are closely monitoring the situation to ensure that Russian warships comply with all maritime security protocols. The U.S. Navy has reportedly deployed its own warships to patrol the North Atlantic, and is asking NATO countries to do the same. The deployment of Russian warships and their missiles marks an extremely dangerous new phase in the stalemate between the United States and Russia, and highlights the fact that both countries are now actively preparing for a possible conflict. The United States and its allies must remain vigilant and united to deter any hostile intentions by Russia and protect vital interests in the West.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "A small group of black-dressed roaring ducks landed on a calm lake near the Texas border town of La Joya. When a lucky photographer captures this amazing moment, the world is about to be introduced into a confusing mystery. A picture of a group of ducks immediately attracted the world, and soon it became popular. Bird lovers from all over the world immediately recognized the species of duck, but it was the strangeness of this place that really excited their interest. In South America and Central America, black roar ducks are commonly seen. In the United States, they are usually visible south of Texas and New Mexico. This is a very rare sight north of the Rio Grande River. As the problem piled up, a team of researchers went to La Joya with financial support from several nature conservation organizations to investigate. What they found shocked them. The lake is filled with other exotic birds, including spoons and several types of Ibis. There are also plenty of fish and other wildlife. But what's even more striking is the way wildlife and habitat coexist in harmony. It's an ecological paradise that can't be explained. Researchers can't help but ask how this unexpected nature was formed. This unique ecosystem seems unlikely to survive in the middle of a desert region. Even more puzzling is the fact that no one seems to know the origins of black whistle ducks. They have lived for years in this little pocket in the Texas desert, but nobody knows where they came from. The only clue lies in some local legends. According to one story, a long-forgotten missionary has been keeping an exotic flock of birds. This mysterious benefactor hides these birds deep in the desert, away from the screaming eyes. Unfortunately, this is the only clue that researchers have at their disposal.The local villagers were unable to provide any further details. The search for answers led the researchers to other parts of the region, where they discovered a network of underground waterways and abandoned settlements. They also learned about ancient civilizations that lived in the area for thousands of years. These incredible findings have led researchers to a startling conclusion: these black dogs are not from South America or Central America. Rather, they are descendants of exotic species that once belonged to the region. The incredible story of the La Jolla duck population has drawn the world's attention. Scientists and bird watchers from all over the world come together to explore this unique ecosystem and work together to protect it for future generations. This incredible photo of a black-clothed barber duck group opens the door to a mysterious world that may never be fully understood. But, as the old saying goes, this is why life is so interesting.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".. In the summer of 2020, I read Chris Voss and Tahl Raz's book Never Distinguish Differentials: Negotiating Like Your Life Depends on It, which has forever changed my life and how I do business. Here are five ways to help me become a more confident negotiator. First of all, this book teaches me how important it is to be prepared. Before any negotiation, you must first understand your own needs and deeply understand the needs of your negotiating partner. By understanding my own needs, I can better identify potential pitfalls; by knowing each other, I can predict potential outcomes and negotiate with confidence. I've learned that the best deal is to feel as if they were negotiating successfully when both sides leave, rather than when one side wins and the other loses. This helps create an atmosphere of cooperation and understanding that allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Voss and Raz's strategy helps me stay focused and avoid giving in to their demands. For example, they suggest reflecting each other's language and repeating the same point of view until they understand you. The book asks me to think outside the box and come up with creative solutions for difficult negotiations. This strategy not only allows me to complete previously deadlocked deals, but also enables me to build better relationships with my partners. Finally, this book teaches me the power of psychology. Voss and Raz provide valuable insights into how people think and how to use that understanding to win negotiations. They outline just how much impact small adjustments in your approach can have on negotiation. But thanks to Chris Voss and Tahl Raz, I've gained the skills and confidence to handle any negotiation. The strategy outlined in Never Distinguish Differentials: Negotiating Like Your Life Depends on It is a valuable part of my journey as a successful entrepreneur.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nRepublicans\u2019 take over of the House this week will usher in a two-year political era that threatens to bring governing showdowns and shutdowns as a GOP speaker and Democratic president try to wield power from opposite ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nThe unprecedented possibility that former President Donald Trump, who\u2019s already launched another bid for the White House, could face indictment could tear the nation further apart at a moment when American democracy remains under grave strain. The already stirring 2024 presidential campaign, meanwhile, will stir more political toxins as both parties sense the White House and control of Congress are up for grabs after the closely fought midterms.\n\nAbroad, the war in Ukraine brings the constant, alarming possibility of spillover into a NATO-Russia conflict and will test the willingness of American taxpayers to keep sending billions of dollars to sustain foreigners\u2019 dreams of freedom. As he leads the West in this crisis, President Joe Biden faces ever more overt challenges from rising superpower China and alarming advances in the nuclear programs of Iran and North Korea.\n\nIf 2022 was a tumultuous and dangerous year, 2023 could be just as fraught.\n\nWashington power shift\n\nWashington is bracing for a sharp shock. Since November, the big story has been about the red wave that didn\u2019t arrive. But the reality of divided government will finally dawn this week. A House Republican majority, in which radical conservatives now have disproportionate influence, will take over one half of Capitol Hill. Republicans will fling investigations, obstruction and possible impeachments at the White House, designed to throttle Biden\u2019s presidency and ruin his reelection hopes.\n\nIronically, voters who disdained Trump-style circus politics and election denialism will get more of it since the smaller-than-expected GOP majority means acolytes of the ex-president, like expected House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan of Ohio and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, will have significant sway. The new Republican-run House represents, in effect, a return to power of Trumpism in a powerful corner of Washington. If House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy wins his desperate struggle against his party\u2019s hardliners to secure the speakership, he\u2019ll be at constant risk of walking the plank after making multiple concessions to extreme right-wingers.\n\nA weak speaker and a nihilistic pro-Trump faction in the wider GOP threaten to produce a series of spending showdowns with the White House \u2013 most dangerously over the need to raise the government\u2019s borrowing authority by the middle of the year, which could throw the US into default if it\u2019s not done.\n\nAs Democrats head into the minority under a new generation of leaders, government shutdowns are more likely than bipartisanship. The GOP is vowing to investigate the business ties of the president\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, and the crisis at the southern border. The GOP could suffer, however, if voters think they overreached \u2013 a factor Biden will use as he eyes a second term.\n\nIn the Senate, Democrats are still celebrating the expansion of their tiny majority in the midterms. (After two years split at 50-50, the chamber is now 51-49 in their favor). Wasting no time in seeking to carve out a reputation among voters as a force for bipartisanship and effective governance, the president will travel to Kentucky this week. He\u2019ll take part in an event also featuring Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, to highlight the infrastructure package that passed with bipartisan support in 2021.\n\nThe potential earthquake of a Trump indictment\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland could shortly face one of the most fateful decisions in modern politics: whether to indict Trump over his attempt to steal the 2020 election and over his hoarding of classified documents.\n\nA criminal prosecution of an ex-president and current presidential candidate by the administration that succeeded him would subject the country\u2019s political and judicial institutions to more extreme strain than even Trump has yet managed. The ex-president has already claimed persecution over investigations he faces \u2013 and an early declaration of his 2024 campaign has given him the chance to frame them as politicized.\n\nIf Trump were indicted, the uproar could be so corrosive that it\u2019s fair to ask whether such an action would be truly in the national interest \u2013 assuming special counsel Jack Smith assembles a case that would have a reasonable chance of success in court.\n\nYet if Trump did indeed break the law \u2013 and given the strength of the evidence of insurrection against him presented in the House January 6 committee\u2019s criminal referrals \u2013 his case also creates an even more profound dilemma. A failure to prosecute him would set a precedent that puts ex-presidents above the law.\n\n\u201cIf a president can incite an insurrection and not be held accountable, then really there\u2019s no limit to what a president can do or can\u2019t do,\u201d outgoing Illinois GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a member of the select committee, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s not guilty of a crime, then I, frankly, fear for the future of his country because now every future president can say, \u2018Hey, here\u2019s the bar.\u2019 And the bar is, do everything you can to stay in power.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s already 2024\n\nLike it or not, with his November announcement, Trump has pitched America into the next presidential campaign. But unusual doubts cloud his future after seven years dominating the Republican Party. His limp campaign launch, bleating over his 2020 election loss and the poor track record of his hand-picked election-denying candidates in the midterms have dented Trump\u2019s aura.\n\nPotential alternative figureheads for his populist, nationalist culture war politics, like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, are emerging who could test the ex-president\u2019s bond with his adoring conservative base. Even as he fends off multiple investigations, Trump must urgently show he\u2019s still the GOP top dog as more and more Republicans consider him a national liability.\n\nBiden is edging closer to giving Americans a new piece of history \u2013 a reelection campaign from a president who is over 80. His success in staving off a Republican landslide in the midterms has quelled some anxiety among Democrats about a possible reelection run. And Biden\u2019s strongest card is that he\u2019s already beaten Trump once. Still, he wouldn\u2019t be able to play that card if Trump fades and another potential GOP nominee emerges. DeSantis, for example, is roughly half the current president\u2019s age.\n\nAs 2023 opens, a repeat White House duel between Trump and Biden \u2013 which polls show voters do not want \u2013 is the best bet. But shifting politics, the momentous events in the months to come and the vagaries of fate means there\u2019s no guarantee this will be the case come the end of the year.\n\nThe world is getting more dangerous\n\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last year showed how outside, global events can redefine a presidency. Biden\u2019s leadership of the West against Moscow\u2019s unprovoked aggression will be an impressive centerpiece of his legacy. But Russian President Vladimir Putin shows every sign of fighting on for years. Ukraine says it won\u2019t stop until all his forces are driven out. So Biden\u2019s capacity to stop the war from spilling over into a disastrous Russia-NATO clash will be constantly tested.\n\nAnd who knows how long US and European voters will stomach high energy prices and sending billions of taxpayer cash to arm Ukraine if Western economies dip into recession this year.\n\nBiden has his hands full elsewhere. An alarming airborne near miss between a Chinese jet and US military jet over the South China Sea over the holiday hints at how tensions in the region, especially over Taiwan, could trigger another superpower standoff. Biden also faces burgeoning nuclear crises with Iran and North Korea, which, along with Russia\u2019s nuclear saber rattling, suggests the beginning of a dangerous new era of global conflict and risk.\n\nThe economy on the brink\n\nRarely has an economy been so hard to judge. In 2022, 40-year-high inflation and tumbling stock markets coincided with historically low unemployment rates, which created an odd simultaneous sensation of economic anxiety and wellbeing. The key question for 2023 will be whether the Federal Reserve\u2019s harsh interest rate medicine \u2013 designed to bring down the cost of living \u2013 can bring about a soft landing without triggering a recession that many analysts believe is on the way.\n\nWashington spending showdowns and potential government shutdowns could also pose new threats to growth. The economy will be outside any political leader\u2019s capacity to control, but its state at the end of the year will play a vital role in an election that will define America, domestically and globally after 2024.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "When 37-year-old Mitchell Stevens first walked home in the Colonel's car, he didn't know what situation he was in. Six months later, he lives in a 30-foot long 1984 Blue Bird school bus known as \"Big Blue\" in the RVs, parked in the backyard of a friend's property in Wasson, Washington. Stevens is one of 44 million Americans with student loan debt, which in his case totaled $108,100. It is hard to imagine that less than a year ago, he lived in Seattle and worked two jobs to pay rents and bills. In both of these jobs, he and his partner earned nearly $80,000 per year, but they still struggled to make ends meet after paying the rent, utilities and other bills. \"At the end of the month, we might have $200-300 in the bank and that eventually prompted me to sell my stuff and get into the bus,\" Stevens told Business Insider. At the time, his partner - who did not want to reveal his name - was working as a graphic designer at home, and Stevens decided to spend as much of their budget on other expenses as possible. \"I've been thinking about long-term issues and doing everything I can to support myself and my partner,\" he said. He sold his furniture and most of the property, and began to live in a friend's spare room. But it didn't last long. With room rent rising, the couple eventually decided to move into the bus. It had been sitting behind the property of a friend of Stevens for some time.Stevens took it to a store to repair, and he and his partner moved in within a few months. Life on the bus has its advantages and disadvantages. \"Winter is really cold, but summer is perfect,\" says Stevens. He and his partner have limited space, but they both work from home and need their own area to work. To make it work, they shut down the larger working space that can be used all day long. \"This is an incredible way to save money while enjoying the lifestyle I'm used to. We can go to restaurants and movie theaters, we can still make money and invest in it. It's not always easy, but it works.\" Living on the bus is also a good way to make statements about student loan debt. \"The student loan debt is by far my biggest regret,\" says Stevens. He took out his student loan to pay for the tuition fees at Seattle Law School, but he left the program without getting a degree. \"I think it's important to talk about the dilemma of student loan debt and its impact on people,\" he said. \"We need to talk about why it's hard for people to pay off their student loans, and how this affects their ability to enjoy the rest of life.\" For Stevens, living on the bus is more than just a statement - it's a way of life. He knows his student debt cannot be wiped out, so staying on the bus is the best way to free up as much budget as possible. Although he struggled with student debt, he was satisfied with his current lifestyle. \"It may not be the way I imagined it to be, but I also learned a lot and gained amazing experiences.

{"text": "Hungarian-born US investor and philanthropist George Soros answers to questions after delivering a speech on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos on May 24, 2022. Fabrice Coffrini | AFP | Getty Images\n\nA nonprofit financed by billionaire George Soros quietly donated $140 million to advocacy organizations and ballot initiatives in 2021, plus another $60 million to likeminded charities. Soros, who personally donated $170 million during the 2022 midterms to Democratic candidates and campaigns on top of that, spread the additional largess through the Open Society Policy Center \u2014 a 501(c)(4) nonprofit that falls under the Soros-funded Open Society Foundations network, according to a copy of its 2021 tax filing, which was obtained by CNBC and is the most recent data available. The Open Society Policy Center also doled out $138 million to advocacy groups and causes in 2020. Two of Soros' children sit on its board, the tax filings and its website shows. The donations bring Soros' contributions to political campaigns and causes since January 2020 to roughly half a billion dollars \u2014 at the least \u2014 most of it steered through dark money nonprofit groups and going largely toward political causes aligned with Democratic Party. Soros' nonprofit donations don't always go directly to political causes. The funds sometimes flow from one of his nonprofits, then to another, before being spent on the advertising, organizing and social media campaigns that directly reach voters. Many of the Open Society Policy Center's 2021 donations weren't necessarily earmarked to help sway the midterm elections, according to the foundation's website. At the same time, Tom Watson, an editorial director at the Open Society Foundations, conceded in an email to CNBC that \"there are definitely some OSPC grants that went to organizations working to combat voter suppression, support voter registration and expand civic participation.\" Those are all core Democratic principals.\n\nComplex network of nonprofits\n\nThe foundation network includes several affiliated 501(c)(4) groups, a type of nonprofit under the U.S. tax code that's allowed to engage in political activities, as well as more traditional 501(c)(3) charitable organizations, its website and tax filing show. All of the nonprofits fall under Soros' Open Society Foundations network, which spans the globe. It describes itself as \"the world's largest private funder of independent groups working for justice, democratic governance, and human rights,\" and it has dozens of offices in the U.S., Europe, Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East. It additionally runs the Open Society University Network, which includes more than two dozen colleges across the world, sponsoring research projects through its Democracy Institute, among other initiatives. While not illegal, the complex network of related nonprofits, research funding and charities financed by Soros obfuscates the original origin of the donations. Through the network, Soros has donated more than $32 billion over the years, according to its website. It says it gives \"thousands of grants every year toward building inclusive and vibrant democracies,\" with active projects in more than 120 countries.\n\nWealthy special interests\n\n\"Wealthy special interests and individuals try to hide their influence in elections, including by funding politically active nonprofits, because they know that the messenger matters,\" Aaron McKean, an attorney at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center said. \"Voters have a right to know who is trying to influence elections so that they can make informed choices when filling out their ballot.\" The Open Society Policy Center's budget in 2021 was funded by a single $196 million donation from the Open Society Foundation network, according to foundation officials. An affiliated 501(c)(3) charitable group called the Open Society Institute received a $1.78 billion donation in QECL shares from the Foundation to Promote Open Society, which was founded and is funded by the billionaire businessman. In the U.S., the Open Society Policy Center donated to a variety of politically active groups and causes since the start of the 2020 election cycle, including $4.5 million in September to Reproductive Freedom for All, according to data from the nonpartisan watchdog OpenSecrets. The campaign backed Michigan's successful ballot initiative called Proposition 3 that enshrined abortion rights into the state's constitution. The group also gave $1 million in 2020 toward a campaign that supported an Oklahoma prison sentencing ballot measure titled Yes on 805. The ballot initiative would have ended repeat sentence penalties for nonviolent offenses in the state; it failed to pass during the 2020 election.\n\nHelping Democrats\n\nThe vast majority of Soros' personal donations during the 2022 cycle went to two super PACs: Democracy PAC and Democracy PAC II, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Both of those groups are run by the billionaire's son Alexander Soros, who also sits on the boards of the Open Society Institute and Open Society Policy Center. Politico reported that these PACs were meant to help Democratic candidates and groups in 2022, and in future election cycles. Records show that the Democracy PACs, which by law can raise and spend an unlimited amount of money, donated millions of dollars in the midterms to organizations that actively helped Democrats running for office, including support for the Senate Majority PAC and the House Majority PAC.

By the time of the Apollo 11 moon landing two years prior, the longest time humans spent in space was only about two weeks.\n\nThis Soviet crew had spent 23 days in space, setting a new record for human space flight endurance, and were finally coming home.\n\nAs the ship made its reentry, one crew communicator back in Yevpatoriya expressed concerns about the lack of reports from the cosmonauts.\n\n\"We asked Dobrovolskiy the whole time to give us a running commentary as soon as the Descent Module enters our coverage zone, but he hasn't said a word,\" crew communicator Aleksei Yeliseyev said, according to Boris Chertok, a space engineer who recounted the mission in his four-volume memoir \"Rockets and People.\" \"It's strange that Volkov is quiet. During the last session, he was very talkative.\"\n\nThe module carrying the men landed around 2 a.m., about 56 miles southwest of the town of Karazhal. A rescue team was immediately dispatched.\n\nChertok recalled there were another 20 minutes of silence when the team received no reports.\n\nFinally, one lead Soviet engineer, with a disturbed expression on his face, would break the news he received from Moscow: Seated \"in tranquil poses,\" Chertok wrote, the three cosmonauts were found dead inside the ship.\n\nAfter the moon race\n\nRussians watch a few-days-delayed broadcasting of the Apollo 11 moon landing in July 1969. Ullstein Bild/AP\n\nThe Soyuz 11 mission launched as the public's interest in the space arena waned.\n\nBy then, Apollo 11 landed on the moon in 1969, which many historians argue was the hallmark event that settled the Great Space Race between the US and the Soviet Union.\n\n\"I think there was a kind of fascination in the '60s with space, and this presented all sorts of cultural things like 'Star Trek,'\" Asif A. Siddiqi, a Fordham University history professor who wrote extensively on the Soviet space program and edited Chertok's memoirs, said in an interview with Insider. \"But I think after the moon race, people just lost interest. People were saying that there's deeper problems at home that we should be devoting our money to.\"\n\nStill, there was much to explore about space and many milestones yet to be broken.\n\nScientists had limited knowledge of the impacts of prolonged weightlessness on the human body, for example. The longest humans had spent in space by the time of the landmark moon landing was about two weeks.\n\n\"The Soviets were always interested in the long-term effects of human beings in space,\" Siddiqi said. \"You couldn't really think about going anywhere, like Mars, unless you really understood how the human body would react.\"\n\nTo recoup the loss of the moon race, the Soviets quickly pivoted to a space station program. They gathered existing equipment and hastily put together a space station that was launched on April 19, 1971. The ship was named Salyut 1 and was the world's first space station to orbit the Earth.\n\nThe first attempt to send cosmonauts to the ship occurred merely three days after Salyut 1's launch. But the four-man crew failed to dock and returned to Earth in less than two days.\n\nThe next attempt came during a notably \"perfect\" June in southern Kazakhstan, Chertok wrote.\n\n\"It had rained recently, accompanied by an unusually cold wind for that time of year,\" he recalled. \"As one might expect, the Tyuratam old-timers tried to convince us that they couldn't recall such a pleasant early June.\"\n\nThree men were assigned to Soyuz 11. However, just two days before the scheduled launch, the discovery of a spot \"the size of a chicken egg\" inside a flight engineer's right lung would alter the fate of the cosmonauts, according to Chertok.\n\nA backup crew consisting of Dobrovolsky, the commander, Volkov, the flight engineer, and Patasayev, a research engineer, would replace the primary team. One engineer rationalized: A \"new crew that hasn't worked together will be worse than the backup crew,\" Chertok wrote.\n\nAnother leap for mankind\n\nThe interior of Salyut 1 space station with the hatchway leading to the Soyuz 11 spacecraft. Sovfoto/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n\nSoyuz 11 launched on June 6, 1971. The three cosmonauts would make a landmark achievement by successfully docking onto Salyut 1 the very next day.\n\nThe space station was of modest size \u2014 comparable to a two or three-bedroom apartment, according to Siddiqi. A lot of the research conducted inside Salyut 1 was related to biomedicine, but the crew performed a wide range of experiments.\n\nAccording to NASA, Patsayev was the first to operate a telescope in space. Inside the oasis chamber, the cosmonauts grew Chinese cabbage and onions. Patsayev became the first person to celebrate their birthday in space, and the men cast their ballots for the Soviet elections.\n\nScientists also wanted to closely monitor the impacts of space on the human body. A treadmill was installed on the Salyut 1 and the cosmonauts forwent their space suits in the space station and Soyuz.\n\n\"One of the things that they were envisioning is that they wanted to get rid of the space suits because they were trying to secure the spacecraft so that you wouldn't need space suits,\" Siddiqi said. \"It was a concession made in the early days when you weren't sure if the spaceships themselves were secure and safe. So they moved the safety consideration from the suit to the ship \u2026 And without the suits, you could put in more stuff, because it becomes spacious inside.\"\n\nThe cosmonauts experienced setbacks including a small fire on board as well as \"personality conflicts,\" according to Siddiqi, but the crew successfully breached an 18-day record also set by the Soviets in 1970.\n\nIn total, they spent about 22 days docked at the station. Chertok, the space engineer and author of \"Rockets and People,\" recalled the day the cosmonauts reached the milestone in his memoir with little fanfare.\n\n\"We departed from the Crimea after agreeing that Dobrovolskiy's crew should set a new record for time spent in space. A preliminary landing date of 30 June was set,\" he wrote.\n\nTragedy inside Soyuz 11\n\nDobrovolsky, Volkov, and Patsaev inside Soyuz 11. Keystone/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nAlmost everything about the Soyuz 11 spacecraft functioned as intended.\n\n\"The Soyuz spacecraft is a very automated ship, so you don't have to do much,\" Siddiqi said. \"The program to return the Soyuz just kept operating and it operated perfectly.\"\n\nThe descent module that carried the three men oriented itself, the parachute deployed, and in the early hours of June 30, 1971, the ship landed softly in the steppes of Kazakhstan. According to Chertok's memoir, a report also stated that the cosmonauts were in good physical condition in the last few days of their journey.\n\nBut a few missteps on the ship and by the Soviet space program led to the tragic deaths of the cosmonauts. Michael Smith, a Cold War historian at Purdue University who studied the Soviet space program, told Insider that he teaches Soyuz 11 \"as a case study in risk planning.\"\n\nSoyuz 11 consisted of three modules. At the front of the ship is a module that operates like the crew's workspace; in the middle is the cabin for the three men; and behind is the service module that carries the engine and power source.\n\nIn order to split the modules, small cartridges containing tiny explosives set off at a precise moment in a sequence. However, according to prevailing theory, the cartridges fired off at the same time, Siddiqi said.\n\nThe shock of the explosion caused a valve in the cabin to open while the ship was at a lethal altitude. The module quickly decompressed, and in a matter of seconds, the cosmonauts lost consciousness.\n\n\"Without space suits and emergency oxygen to protect them, the cosmonauts perished,\" Smith said.\n\nJust two minutes after landing, a rescue team in a helicopter made contact with the module lying on its side. Chertok recalled a report he heard from Kerim Kerimov, one of the key founders of the Soviet space program:\n\n\"They quickly opened the hatch. All three were sitting in their seats in tranquil poses. There were dark blue spots on their faces. Blood was running from the nose and ears. They pulled them out of the Descent Module. Dobrovolsky was still warm. Doctors continued to perform artificial resuscitation. According to their reports from the landing site, death was the result of asphyxiation.\"\n\nAn autopsy report conducted afterward made a \"harrowing impression,\" Chertok wrote:\n\n\"Mentally placing themselves into the Descent Module, everyone tried to imagine how the cosmonauts felt during those first seconds. The excruciating pain throughout their bodies prevented them from thinking and comprehending. Certainly, they heard the whistle of escaping air, but their eardrums quickly burst, and silence set in. Judging by the speed of the drop in pressure, they were able to actively move and attempt to do something for perhaps the first 15 to 20 seconds.\"\n\nThe valve opened at about a 105-mile altitude, above the Karman line \u2014 an imaginary boundary often used to determine when space flight is reached.\n\nDobrovolsky, Volkov, and Patsayev are the only humans to date to have died beyond that line.\n\nHad the cosmonauts been wearing space suits, the three men certainly could have survived the event of depressurization, Siddiqi said. However, another pitfall of the mission was insufficient testing, which was partly due to the haste created by the space race.\n\n\"A lot of failures in the spaceship don't appear immediately,\" Siddiqi said. \"You have to sometimes test it 50 times before something shows up. So they didn't fly these things enough to really know how it would react.\"\n\nWorld nations mourn\n\nCrowds march through Red Square in Moscow to mourn the death of the three cosmonauts. Keystone/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nA day of national mourning was held along with a massive state funeral, according to Time magazine. Condolences from Soviet leaders were extended to the men's families.\n\nIn a message to Nikolai Podgorny, the head of state of the Soviet Union at the time, President Richard Nixon wrote: \"The American people join me in expressing to you and the Soviet people our deepest sympathy on the tragic death of the three Soviet cosmonauts. The whole world followed the exploits of these courageous explorers of the unknown and shares the anguish of their tragedy. But the achievement of cosmonauts Dobrovolsky, Volkov, and Patsayev remains.\"\n\nAccording to Siddiqi, the death of the three cosmonauts had a lasting impact on the Soviet space program afterward. Another flight attempt wasn't made for more than two years.\n\n\"In retrospect, you don't want people to die, but it may have been the one thing that allowed the designers to stop and take a deep breath,\" he said.\n\nBy the late 1970s, there were no more fatalities. The Soviets launched the Salyut 6 space station in 1977 and was an indisputable success. Multiple large crews docked and undocked with the station, and the duration of the missions steadily increased from three months to six months.\n\n\"On a happier note, the subsequent Soviet redesigns and improvements to the Soyuz capsules (including space suits for ascent and descent) have been remarkably durable,\" Smith said. \"Soyuz 11 was that last fatal space disaster for the Soviet Union and Russian Federation.\"", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The Devil Slides in California - A father has been jailed for deliberately driving his Tesla from a notorious scam on the morning of January 3. The driver's identity has not yet been revealed, and he has been charged with multiple vehicle killings and reckless dangerous offenses. The incident began when the father and his teenage daughter were driving along a Devil's Slide area in northern California, known for its narrow bypass roads, steep sinking and dangerous conditions. Reports show that several people who crossed the carriage warned his father to take another route, but he went on despite warnings. As they passed the alarm line, witnesses saw him firing at the accelerator and driving the vehicle directly into the alert line, which gave way under impact. Tesla then fell from the hillside, falling more than 500 feet before stopping. Local authorities and first responders arrived at the scene and found the driver was still alive with his daughter hanging on a tree. Later it was revealed that his father had deliberately pushed Tesla off the edge, which could only be described as a suicide attempt. Investigators discovered that his father had a history of depression and had recently gone through a particularly difficult period. Her daughter survived, and later revealed that her father had been discussing suicide. It is not clear why the father chose this particular location or whether he also intended to let his daughter die. In any case, the incident has brought a shock wave to the close-knit community of Devil's Slides, where at least 30 people have been reported dead over the past three decades due to their deceitful nature. Local authorities are trying to determine the father's motives and possible motives in this tragic event. At the same time, his father is still in prison awaiting trial, represented by a public defender, currently detained without bail, and his daughter has been kept secret because of her age. The local family is taking care of her. The news of the father's actions sparked an online debate about the responsibilities of parents suffering from depression and how best to protect their children during this emotionally difficult time. Mental health experts continue to stress the importance of seeking help and providing resources for those who may be struggling. Regardless of the outcome, this situation is a clear reminder of the tragedies that can occur when people do not recognize the warning signs of mental illness.

The 1.9% increase was the largest of any US state over this period.\n\nAmple job opportunities \u2014 evidenced by one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation \u2014 and the growth of remote work have made it possible for many Americans to move to the Sunshine State. Many have also been drawn there because it's one of nine states with no state income tax, which could potentially save them thousands of dollars per year.\n\nWhen you look at the full picture, however, it's unclear if moving to Florida will prove to be a smart financial decision in the years to come. It all depends on where you work, which city you live in, and how much risk you're willing to take when it comes to homeownership, insurance, and healthcare.\n\nFlorida's home and rent costs are rising at some of the fastest rates in the US, and wages aren't keeping up\n\nA 2019 Joblist study that compared wages to cost of living in the US, ranked Florida last out of all 50 states in terms of affordability. That was before Americans flocked to the state over the last few years and caused home and rent prices to surge.\n\nIn 2022, five of the 20 most competitive US rental markets were in Florida, per RentCafe, with Miami-Dade county and Orlando at number one and three respectively. As of October, the cost of a one-bedroom apartment in the state had increased 36% since the start of the pandemic, per Apartment List, with only New Mexico and Idaho seeing a higher uptick. At roughly $1,420, only five states charged a higher monthly rent for the typical one-bedroom as of October.\n\nFor homebuyers, prices grew nearly 30% in Florida between the second quarter of 2021 and 2022, the most of any state. Its median home value, however, remains middle of the pack compared to the rest of the country.\n\n\"There's just no way for people living here to afford it \u2014 the salaries that they pay here don't add up to the cost of rent,\" Nicole Panesso, a millennial who lived in Florida her whole life until moving to Tennessee last year, previously told Insider.\n\nPer the Census Bureau, the median household income in Florida was roughly $62,000 in 2021, below the median US household income of roughly $71,000. A September ADP report, however, found that Florida's wage growth had outpaced the national inflation rate \u2014 if not the state's cost of living \u2014 over the prior 12 months.\n\nInsurance and healthcare are high, while overall taxes are low\n\nDue in part to weather concerns, the average Florida resident pays more than almost anyone else in the country for property insurance and car insurance. The total cost of car ownership, which includes gas prices and repair costs, is slightly above the national average.\n\nAdditionally, a November Forbes analysis using data from the Kaiser Family Foundation found Florida to be the fourth most expensive state for healthcare in the country, adding that residents with employer-provided family health coverage pay over $7,000 annually, the highest premium of any state. The elevated health insurance rates are in part because Florida's employers generally don't cover as much of the healthcare costs as those in other states do.\n\nDespite the lack of an income tax, Florida has higher sales and property taxes than some of its peers, and due to Florida law, newcomers are seeing higher property tax increases than longstanding residents. The state's overall tax burden, however, remains among the lowest in the nation, and is among the reasons so many retirees move there.\n\nWhat to consider before moving to Florida\n\nWhile Florida might not be the single most affordable state in the country, contrary to the Joblist study's claim, it's likely not the least affordable either.\n\nAmong the most expensive states to live in, \"Florida's not even in the top 10,\" University of Illinois economics professor David Albouy to The Associated Press last October.\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin economics professor Steven Deller agreed.\n\n\"Florida is above the national average, but it's not even close to the most expensive place to live,\" he said.\n\nThese comments were consistent with a 2022 CNBC analysis, which said Florida was the 27th best state in terms of cost of living.\n\nBefore moving to the Sunshine State, it's worth considering how Florida's cost of living compares to where you live now, and to your potential employment opportunities. In 2019, New York and Georgia saw the most residents move to Florida. Those from New York, which CNBC's analysis named the second most expensive state in terms of cost of living, might have benefitted from the move. However, those coming from Georgia \u2014 the 4th least expensive state \u2014 might have found themselves worse off financially.\n\nSome people may ultimately choose to move to Florida, but keep their remote job in a higher paying state. They may avoid the most competitive rental markets like Miami-Dade and Orlando. Others might choose to forego a car purchase or look for areas with more moderate property taxes or insurance costs.\n\nIndeed, the lack of an income tax is a major financial perk for Floridians. But it alone is not enough to justify a move to Florida \u2014 at least from a financial perspective.", "label": "human"}
{"text": ".. The Social Security payment schedule for 2023 has finally been released, and it will be an interesting year for millions of Americans who depend on welfare. With the current uncertainty surrounding social security and the debate about what might change, now is the best time to get familiar with the upcoming payment schedule. It is important to know when you will receive your Social Security benefits so that you can plan your monthly budget accordingly. This will help ensure that you have the money you need when you need it, so it's best to keep an eye out for a payment schedule in 2023. The social security payment schedule for 2023 will start on January 3 and last until December 28.On January 3, Social Security payments for the month of December will be processed, so make sure to update your checking account information before this date to avoid any delays.In addition, you should expect to receive your Social Security payment on the third Wednesday of each month. If your payment date is a federal holiday or weekend, you can receive payments one day in advance. This means that if January 3 is a holiday or weekend, you will receive payments on December 31. In addition to the regular payment plan, there are four \"catch-up\" payments throughout the year, which are issued in April, July, October and December to help people who have not been able to enjoy benefits due to financial difficulties. The catch-up amount is the difference between the amount that an individual normally receives per month and the amount paid on a regular basis. The Social Security Payment Schedule for 2023 also includes an increase in the Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA), which is adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This year, COLA growth is expected to be 2.6%, which is the same as that seen in 2020. In addition to the payment schedule, there are other important dates to keep in mind. January 2 is the official start of the open season, which is the period during which individuals can change their Social Security benefits. During this time, individuals can change their own benefits, including changing the retirement age or increasing the amount of their benefits.The open season ends on March 17, so be sure to make any adjustments before that date. Finally, it's important to remember that Social Security benefits change over time. It's important to keep abreast of and update on any changes made to Social Security so you can make sure you get the amount of benefits you deserve. Knowing when payments will help you plan your budget, COLA increases and the opening season are important dates to be aware of. By staying informed and up-to-date about Social Security, you can ensure that you get the benefits you deserve.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Yesterday, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case that could determine the fate of SAFE-T Act, a federal regulation designed to end cash bail across the country. The provision was passed in 2019 but challenged in 2020 by a group of sheriffs and court clerks from around the country who considered the law unconstitutional. The Security Act, which was passed as part of the First Step Act, is a comprehensive criminal justice reform law designed to address the gap between low-level, nonviolent offenders and those convicted of more serious crimes. Changes made include the repeal of the federal cash bail system, which allows those accused of lower-level crimes to remain in prison until they can afford their way out. Challengers argue that the federal government has gone beyond its limits by passing a law that replaces the power of state governments to set bail policies. They further argue that the law is too heavy and expensive, and lacks sufficient flexibility in when and how to grant bail. Judge Stephen Breyer, acknowledging the challenges that cash bail poses to the justice system, said: \"There is ample evidence that even for the same crimes, African-American defendants are treated differently in the criminal justice system than others... I sympathize with the idea that change is needed here.\" However, he also expressed doubts about the power of the federal government to enact the changes sought by the Security Act. He noted that bail reforms traditionally fall within the purview of state legislatures and courts should be \"very careful\" when it comes to interfering with and going beyond their decisions. Ultimately, the fate of the SAFE-T provisions is likely to remain unknown for the foreseeable future. With a majority of members of the court and two appointees from President Joe Biden expressing concerns about the constitutionality of the provision, it seems unlikely that the Supreme Court will rule in favour of this provision. If so, then Congress will pass a new law to replace state laws and pave the way for a new bail reform system. But it's also important to remember that this is a complex issue, and any major change may take some time before it takes effect. Meanwhile, advocates will continue to push for bail reforms to help address systemic inequalities that have been prominent in recent years.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "In a gesture of support for election officials and police who attacked the U.S. Capitol last month, President Joe Biden will present them with a presidential medal on Wednesday to mark the first anniversary of the attack. \"President Biden will award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to election officials from state, local and federal levels who risk their lives in order to ensure the safety of our electoral system,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Tuesday. The President will also award medals to election officials in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Washington, D.C. He will also give medals to the U.S. Capitol Police Department, the Washington Metropolitan Police Department and other law enforcement personnel responding to the attacks. These medals represent the president's rare recognition of civil servants who, at great personal risk, strive to ensure the security and integrity of a nation's democracy. \"On January 6, when hundreds of people tried to undermine legitimate elections and undermine our democracy, those we will respect today are unwaveringly committed to upholding our constitutional form of government,\" the White House said in a statement. The attack on the Capitol by Trump-backed mobs killed at least five people and caused widespread damage to the building. It led to a second impeachment of former President Donald Trump, and highlighted the role of law enforcement in protecting American democracy. The incident also exposed the need for better security measures against elections and raised concerns about the ability of foreign actors to interfere in future U.S. elections. \"President Biden has long been a strong advocate for protecting our electoral system, and he has repeatedly called for better information sharing and coordination between federal, state and local authorities,\" Psaki said. The medals will be presented at the White House National Restaurant on Wednesday, with winners including local and state election officials, security personnel and other law enforcement officers. Medals are usually awarded to individuals who have made significant contributions to national security, including the military or federal law enforcement officers, but the White House said Biden's medal was also meant to celebrate civil servants' achievements. \"They've done their job, risked their lives and responded to the call of our nation,\" said the White House. \"Through their work, they have protected our constitutional form of government and reaffirmed our commitment to democracy around the world.\" Biden's decision to award medals to election officials and police came as he sought to strengthen public confidence in the safety and security of the country's electoral system. President Trump has often expressed his commitment to protecting the integrity of elections and promising to work with Congress to reform the nation's electoral system. The move was also seen as an effort by some to argue that the Trump administration had failed to act against foreign interference in the 2016 election. Biden is expected to sign an executive order on Wednesday outlining how the federal government will improve election security, which is expected to include measures to increase cybersecurity and enhance information sharing between federal and state election officials. These medals are a way for Biden to thank those who have worked to ensure the safety and security of his country's electoral system. While some may see them as a political gesture, the symbolic significance of this gesture is clear: it is a sign that the president supports those committed to keeping elections fair and safe in the country.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "A cardiac arrest is a medical emergency that requires immediate attention, which occurs when the heart suddenly stops beating and draws blood throughout the body. If someone is in a cardiac arrest state, it is important to act quickly and seek help. Understanding the signs of cardiac arrest and developing action plans can help save lives. It's also important to understand what to do if someone experiences a heart attack, and how to recognize it in others. Signs of cardiac arrest include sudden loss of consciousness, lack of breath or breathing, no pulse, and a blue or gray skin color. It is important to check for the presence of pulse and breathing as soon as possible. If it does not exist, call 911 and start chest compression as soon as possible. If someone has a cardiac arrest, the most important thing is to call 911 and start chest compression. Breast compression helps to circulate oxygen-rich blood throughout the body, increasing the chances of successful recovery. The best way to perform chest compression is to use the heel of one hand and place it in the center of the chest. Once an ambulance arrives, the medical team will take over the care and use a defibrillator to electricize the heart to restore its normal rhythm. The medical team will also provide oxygen and medications such as adrenaline to help reverse the effects of cardiac arrest. It is important to understand that cardiac arrest can happen to anyone, regardless of age or health history. Therefore, when someone is in a state of cardiac arrest, it is necessary to be prepared and know what to do. Taking time to check the steps and knowing how to recognize signs and symptoms of cardiac arrest can save a person's life. Although chest compression is the best way to help with cardiac arrest, aspects can also use AED (automatic external defibrillator). AED is a device that provides an electric shock to the heart to restore its normal rhythm. AED is widely available in public places and many are easy to use. Most AEDs come equipped with voice instructions, so users will know exactly what to do. When using AED, it is important to ensure that the person receiving the shock lies on a flat dry surface. Be sure to follow all instructions carefully, as incorrect use of AED can be dangerous. If someone has a cardiac arrest, it's important to act quickly and seek help. Calling 911, starting chest compression and using AED can help save lives. Knowing what to do in an emergency can make everything different.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "For the first time in the show's history, TCU won a place at the college football postseason national championship. The 11th Horn Frog beat Michigan by 51-45 and quarterback Trevon Boykin scored four goals in total. The exciting game is the most scoring FESTA Bowl in history, with four lead changes and an amazing finish. When the TCU leads at 51-45 and takes only two minutes to race, the match seems to have ended, but Michigan drove less than 10 seconds on Horned Frogs' 10th line. However, when Jabrill Peppers kicked the ball out of the finish area and kept the TCU winning, Wolverines' hopes for a game add-down were broken. Both teams were trading points at the start of the game, as Boykin and Wolves quarterback Wilton Speth threw a pair of touchpoints each in the first half. The frog's defense was firmly established late in the second quarter, forcing them to quickly round up and setting long-term drive for the TCU. TCU's defense is the story of the second half. The Frog forced Michigan to play four games in a half and three straight wins, while the Wolves were kept in an overall attack of 48 yards in the third quarter. Boykin added his impressive status line in the fourth quarter by throwing his fourth touch-of-the-ground score pass at Dockson to raise the TCU by 11 points. Spett provided the Wolverin's final impetus, going straight to Peppers 3 times to get the game played in 3 games. But TCU's defense persisted, forcing Woolflin to beat the team 1:13. Boykin finished the game with 386 passes and four touchdowns, adding 94 yards and 2 points to the ground. Dockerson was Boygin's main target, gaining nine passes in a 180 yards and 2 point match. On defense, the TCU is led by sideback Rantony Texada, who has recorded three hits and two pass losses. The victory marks the TCU's first major Bowl victory since the Rose Bowl in 2011, and the most significant victory of Gary Patterson's era. The Yellow Frog now have a chance to make history as they are the second Big 12 team to reach the national championship during the playoff period. They will face Clemson or Alabama in the championship match on January 11.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Jake McCabe has been the reliable, smart, effective defensive defenseman with a touch of offensive ability this season that the Blackhawks thought they were getting last season.\n\nThe ironic part is McCabe has become the right player at the wrong time.\n\nWhen ex-Hawks general manager Stan Bowman signed McCabe to a four-year contract in 2021, he thought the former Sabre would play a big part in the Hawks\u2019 defensive stabilization. But McCabe \u2014 still hampered by the shoulder that had undergone surgery the winter before \u2014 struggled mightily out of the gate, along with the rest of the team, and never really found his rhythm.\n\nNow under GM Kyle Davidson, McCabe\u2019s age (29) and term (2.5 years left under contract) no longer fit the organizational timeline, especially with so many prospect defensemen pushing toward the NHL.\n\nBut McCabe has nonetheless finally settled into the role Bowman imagined him filling. He has arguably been the Hawks\u2019 best player this season.\n\nAnd he produced one of his best performances in the Hawks\u2019 2-0 shutout win Friday over the Coyotes, even beyond his 89 mile-per-hour slapshot goal.\n\n\u201cWatching him in the third period, making street-hockey [style] kick saves in front of the goalie, he\u2019s a warrior,\u201d coach Luke Richardson said. \u201cHe\u2019s not afraid to put his body on the line for the team. It was great to see him get rewarded on the offensive side, but [it was] just a real good complete game by him and Seth [Jones]. They were both excellent tonight.\u201d\n\nPutting McCabe with Jones, who may not be quite deserving of his 2023 NHL All-Star selection but is unquestionably a good player, has proven to be a wise move. Both have benefited from getting away from Jack Johnson.\n\n\u201cMe and Seth as of late, as a pair, have been playing pretty solid,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cWe played really well [Friday]. We moved pucks quickly, we didn\u2019t spend too much time in our \u2018D\u2019-zone and we were just solid throughout the game, with good gaps reading off each other. [We\u2019ve been] getting more comfortable with each other the last couple weeks.\u201d\n\nMcCabe mentioned his gap control again in a follow-up question about what has contributed most to his success this season, and he\u2019s absolutely correct about that.\n\nThe Hawks are generally atrocious at defending their own blue line, but McCabe\u2019s physicality, strong positioning and awareness of his partner\u2019s positioning make him the lone exception. He\u2019s the only Hawks defenseman who grades out above-average in both total zone entry targets and zone entries allowed leading to scoring chances, per data from All Three Zones.\n\nMeanwhile, his 44.6% expected-goals ratio and 42.8% scoring-chance ratio at five-on-five may not look pretty, but he\u2019s the best Hawks defenseman in both those categories, too. Plus, he also not only leads the Hawks but entered Saturday tied for ninth in the NHL with 83 blocked shots.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s [even] blocking shots when the game is out of reach with a minute to go,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s doing it either way, if we\u2019re down three goals or we\u2019re up four.\u201d\n\nOffensively, McCabe\u2019s 10 points now rank second among Hawks defensemen, behind only Jones. He\u2019s cautious about pinching, but he typically makes a positive impact when he does. Since the Hawks\u2019 early-December win at the Rangers, a game in which he was very active in the \u2018O\u2019-zone, he has been doing that more.\n\nAnd although plus-minus is a flawed stat, the fact he sports a plus-three rating on a team with a minus-59 goal differential is so absurd that it\u2019s worth noting.\n\n\u201cI try to be the leader on the back end,\u201d he said. \u201cReally, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been focusing on all year: being steady and confident. Just keep the good things going when they\u2019re going good.\u201d", "label": "human"}
{"text": "As tensions between Ukraine and its eastern separatist enemies continue to rise, a new source of concern has emerged in the country: the proliferation of Iranian-made drones. In a new report released this week by the International Crisis Group (ICG), the introduction of Iranian-made drones is \"a significant shift in the balance of power in the conflict.\" Low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles allow separatists to conduct regular reconnaissance missions on territory under their control and have an \"worrisome\" impact on Ukrainian combat forces. What's more, the report says drones are hard to shoot down - and it could cost between $20,000 and $500,000 to do so. \"The possibility of effective use [of drones] makes it a very difficult weapon to defend against,\" Igor Sutyagin, senior fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, told Business Insider. The ICG report notes that drones with a manufacturing cost of just $20,000 are becoming an increasingly powerful tool in conflicts such as Ukraine. \"This is especially true for small units far from their main battle zones, whose financial resources are limited and they can't afford a stronger, more expensive anti-drone defense system,\" the report said. These drones can be equipped with a variety of payloads, including high-resolution cameras, infrared imaging and even explosives for the Kamikaze mission. They are used to monitor the movements of Ukrainian troops, conduct reconnaissance in urban areas, and even target critical infrastructure such as power plants and communication lines. The ICG reports that in some cases, drones have even been used to coordinate artillery attacks on Ukrainian positions. The proliferation of these drones has raised alarm bells in Ukraine, which is engaged in a six-year conflict with Russian-backed Eastern separatists. According to the report, Ukrainian forces have been struggling to deal with new threats due to limited available resources and lack of advanced air defense systems. The report also pointed out that in addition to the cost of shooting down the drone, the process faces technical and tactical challenges, such as first positioning the drone and avoiding civilian casualties. Ukraine is not the only country that has responded to these drone threats. According to the report, other separatist forces have used similar types of drones, including those fighting in Libya, Syria and Yemen. \"The proliferation of drones in conflict zones is a growing concern, and the government and military must invest in appropriate responses to ensure the safety of their troops and local civilians,\" IGC researcher Anna Borshchevskaya said in a statement. The ICG report urges governments to work more closely together to reduce the proliferation of drones and better equip their forces to deal with them. \"The conflict in Ukraine underscores the need for governments to consider strategies that limit the availability of these technologies, especially for non-state actors,\" the report said. \"Ultimately, this means addressing the need for stricter regulation of the global drone market and more effective export control regimes.\" Sutiakin agrees with this view, noting that the government needs to take a proactive approach to address the potential security threats posed by the spread of drones. \"The best way to deal with this problem is through close international cooperation and market regulation,\" he said, \"which will involve systematic efforts to prevent transfers to unstable regions, require disclosure of the origin of drones, limit sales to specific individuals, and take other measures to ensure that markets are not dominated by such weapons.\"", "label": "machine"}

How will they interpret the past?\n\nDrew Gilpin Faust\u2019s article on students\u2019 inability to read cursive reminded me of a similar lack of knowledge that I encountered years ago, when I was teaching at the University of Colorado. I had assigned my students timed presentations. There were no clocks in our classrooms (supposedly too distracting), so I brought in a portable analog clock. To my surprise, none of my students could read it\u2014they only told time on their cellphones.\n\nNaomi Rachel\n\nBoulder, Colo.\n\nExplore the January/February 2023 Issue Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. View More\n\nAs a professional calligrapher, an advocate for the continued practice of cursive, and a lover of handwriting, I share the wistfulness Drew Gilpin Faust expresses over the decline of cursive. And while I admit that in a practical sense, writing is a technology, I must add that it\u2019s an art form too, a thing of beauty regardless of skill level or perfection of form. It\u2019s a wondrous visual reminder of individuality and adds an element of artistry and humanness to everyday life.\n\nRecently, I was scribing gift notes at a retailer in New York City and a teenage boy watched over my shoulder curiously as I used an oblique dip pen and inkwell. I was shocked when he asked what language I was writing in: I realized that to kids who haven\u2019t learned script, I may as well be writing in cuneiform. Perhaps there\u2019s a future for me in antiquities translation.\n\nRita Polidori O\u2019Brien\n\nStaten Island, N.Y.\n\nLike Drew Gilpin Faust, I too will grieve the loss of the art of cursive writing. I was a third-grade teacher, and one of the goals of that grade was to transition the students from printing to cursive. The lessons started in September, and by January all schoolwork was to be in cursive.\n\nBy spring, a wee little miracle always occurred. Despite the rote instruction each child received, every student organically stylized their own penmanship. Some wrote in concise, blocky letters; others were more florid and ornate. By May, an unsigned test or report was easily recognizable by the student\u2019s penmanship and returned to the owner, like a note passed secretly between friends.\n\nThe loss of cursive will be a loss of individuality that today\u2019s students won\u2019t even know they\u2019ve suffered\u2014but I will.\n\nRebecca Lee\n\nRocky River, Ohio\n\nWhen I was in grammar school in the 1950s, we were taught cursive in the third grade, after having learned the ABCs in caps and lowercase during the two years before. Bad penmanship was admonished, and corrected. We practiced.\n\nToday I work as a lawyer, and I always have two lines for signatures\u2014the signed name and the printed name below. This is because 100 percent of the time the former is illegible.\n\nRecently I had to examine old land transfers in the New York City deeds records. The books, dating from the 1940s, had handwritten records of titles, names, and land-lot numbers. I was struck by the sureness of the clerks\u2019 script, the clarity of their handwriting\u2014it was quite beautiful. Line after line of exactitude and symmetry. And this just to record the ordinary.\n\nStephen M. Zelman\n\nNew York, N.Y.\n\nDrew Gilpin Faust replies:\n\nI am grateful for the surprising outpouring of responses to my article\u2014in letters to the magazine, on social media, and in my own email box\u2014because they underscored my sense that cursive\u2019s decline marks a meaningful generational divide and cultural transition. The messages could provide material for an article of their own\u2014touching stories of early pedagogical encounters sent by students and teachers alike, tales of the joy of mastery and artistry involved in learning cursive, and comments from dissenters ready to bid farewell to cursive with no regrets. One of my favorites of those came from a father who noted that, after all, his son hasn\u2019t learned to churn butter. But the many moving tributes to cursive leave me convinced that it is far from dead, and not going quietly.\n\nLet Puerto Rico Be Free\n\nThe only just future for the archipelago is not statehood, but full independence from the United States, Jaquira D\u00edaz argued in the November 2022 issue.\n\nAs a Puerto Rican who has lived on the island my entire life and as a state representative who favors statehood, I found Jaquira D\u00edaz\u2019s article on our political situation deeply misleading. Its title suggests that Puerto Rico wants to be free but has not yet been allowed to be. Even worse, it argues that independence represents the \u201conly just future\u201d for us. The problem with these claims, and the cherry-picked historical summary to support them, is simple: In the last major plebiscite on the island, the political option with the most support was statehood and some form of free association with the U.S. Independence may well be a legitimate option preferred by the author and others, but how can the \u201conly just\u201d alternative consistently be the one least supported by the people? Statehood and independence supporters can agree that the decolonization of Puerto Rico is a moral imperative for the United States, but from beginning to end, that process must be centered on respect for and adherence to the democratic will of the Puerto Rican people.\n\nJos\u00e9 Bernardo M\u00e1rquez\n\nToa Baja, Puerto Rico\n\nFrom the Archives\n\nIn \u201cCan a Building Be Too Tall?,\u201d Bianca Bosker explores the engineering feats that have propelled skyscrapers to new heights. High-rises began dotting the New York skyline in the late 1800s, she writes\u2014but not to universal acclaim.\n\nIn The Atlantic\u2019s October 1902 issue, the author Burton J.

{"text": "1980-2003 I am the author of As online dating grows, and as more and more dating sites enter the market, we've put together 20 of the best dating sites in the UK today to help you get started. The prevalence of sugar babies has surged over the past five years. It is estimated that about 120,000 people in the UK alone are involved, although most of the participants are young women, but also a considerable number of older women and even men. For those who don't know, being a sugar babe is when you sign up for a dating site and match it with \"Sugar Dad\" or \"Sugar Mom\", they agree to pay the cost of your time with them. I'm one of those 120,000 people and as a \"sugar baby\" I make $80,000 a year - men pay me to date. I started out with an ordinary life, growing up in a middle-class family in London as a child. It was clear from my childhood that money was scarce and I never really got any privileges or opportunities. My childhood wasn't the happiest of all, and I vowed to do something for myself when I was young. After school, I went to college but didn't get my degree. I got a job in a coffee shop that wasn't something I dreamed of - but I was grateful for the money I brought with me. Then I moved to retail, where I got promoted, but I found myself never really getting the money I wanted. After a while, I decided to start my own business. It was a terrible move and took a lot of risks, but I was willing to accept it. I borrowed money from my parents, which was a struggle for them, and set up my own shop to sell hand-made jewelry. It was a success, but I still struggled with the balance of payments. That was my first introduction to the world of sugar babe. A friend recommended me a website and said that if I signed up, I could make some very good money. It seemed like a good idea, so I registered and set up my profile.I'm absolutely surprised by the amount of information I get from men.I realize that I have something guys want, which is companionship and attention. I've had a few dates, but quickly met a middle-aged, wealthy businessman who was willing to pay me a decent amount of money for my company. We were honest with each other and both agreed that it was just a partnership, nothing more. We've been seeing each other for more than a year, and he pays me $80,000 a year as his companion. We go out to eat, drink, watch movies, etc. He makes me feel special. I feel fortunate to have found such an amazing relationship that I can make money by doing what I love. This money allows me to repay my parents and provide the financial support needed for my business. My life is also freer than ever, traveling and exploring. I would encourage any woman who wants to make money and have more freedom to consider becoming a sugar baby in her life, because it can be a great source of income as well as a great way to meet people.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "LONDON, Dec 29 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Tough times mean tough decisions. In recent years more shoppers have forked out for organic and plant-based food. But persistent inflation and skimpier incomes, coupled with high input costs, will make it a tough year for conscious consumers and the companies that serve them.\n\nTake plant-based meat substitutes. They produce 30%-90% fewer emissions than their animal-derived counterparts, but a pound of the stuff costs shoppers twice as much, according to the Good Food Institute, a think tank. That puts fake meat on the chopping block when buyers are watching their wallets. Numerator, a market researcher, reckons 29.8% of U.S. households bought planted-based meat alternatives in the year to Sept. 30 \u2013 1.1 percentage points lower than in the previous 12 months.\n\nIt\u2019s part of a broader onset of eco apathy. Market researcher Kantar surveyed attitudes towards plastic use among almost 100,000 consumers in 24 markets. The proportion of shoppers who were \u201chighly concerned\u201d about waste and took action accordingly was down 4 percentage points year-on-year to just 18%. Meanwhile 44% of consumers were uninterested and took little to no action, a 7 percentage point increase.\n\nReuters Graphics\n\nCompanies that have been riding the sustainability wave are preparing for leaner times. Beyond Meat (BYND.O), a maker of plant-based burgers, announced in October that it was laying off 19% of its workforce and targeting positive operating cash flow in the second half of 2023. But weak demand will weigh on its top line, while high input costs will pressure margins. The price of U.S. pea protein isolate \u2013 a key ingredient in many meat substitutes \u2013 rose 10% between April 2021 and November 2022, according to Mintec Benchmark Prices. Forecasts compiled by Refinitiv suggest Beyond Meat\u2019s revenue will shrink almost 1% in 2023, and its operating cash flow is still projected to be negative in the second half of the year. Sales at Oatly (OTLY.O), which makes milk substitutes from oats, are projected to grow 25%, but it may still have to raise money.\n\nThere are some signs of hope for ethical consumers. UBS analysts note that significant rises in the price of grain, used in animal feed, could push up the cost of conventional meat more than that of plant-based alternatives. That would edge meat substitutes closer to their goal of one day costing the same, or less, than their animal-based equivalents. But in the meantime, 2023 looks set to leave a sour taste.\n\nFollow @olivertaslic on Twitter\n\n(This is a Breakingviews prediction for 2023.

{"text": "According to a report by the Nikkei Asia Review, Dell hopes to get rid of Chinese semiconductors as early as 2024. The PC giant is said to be exploring ways to replace chips with chips from other countries in order to reduce its reliance on Chinese products. In the report, a person familiar with the matter said that Dell, which produces consumer-grade laptops, desktops and servers, has been researching and developing semiconductor products for some time now and is looking to introduce them into its products in the next few years. Dell did not comment publicly on the matter. But analysts point out that Dell's long-standing relationship with Intel and its interest in UK ARM processors are two potential sources of chips. This will enable Dell to diversify its chip supply chain and avoid the risk of overreliance on China. The report comes as the U.S.'s dependence on China's semiconductor supply has come under increasing scrutiny, seen as a major national security issue. The United States has long accused China of stealing intellectual property and other economic crimes, prompting the Trump administration to impose tariffs on Chinese goods and restrictions on Chinese investment and technology. Apple recently announced plans to bring its chip production to the U.S., and Qualcomm is reportedly now downplaying the idea of expanding chips production in the U.S. Dell's decision may be partly driven by the need to remain competitive in the global PC market. China, the world's largest PC supplier, could put it at a disadvantage if Dell abandons Chinese chips, while rivals like Lenovo and HP still rely heavily on Chinese chips. The move could also be driven by Dell's own policy of avoiding political risk. Dell recently announced its neutrality in the U.S.-China trade conflict, saying it did not want to \"take a position on this or any other geopolitical issue.\" The impact of Dell's decision on the semiconductor market remains to be seen. While this is not enough to offset U.S. reliance on Chinese chips, it may help reduce the impact of Chinese-made products on U.S. technology markets. At present, Dell is reportedly exploring options and methods for replacing Chinese chips in its products. If it succeeds to do so, it will be an important step forward in the United States' efforts to reduce dependence on Chinese products.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Global health officials are increasingly concerned about China's lack of transparency on the Covid 19 pandemic. Since the virus may have originated in China, the extent of the outbreak remains largely a mystery, and many public health officials expressed disappointment at the lack of information from Beijing. The United States is one of the countries concerned about China's lack of transparency, as the world's largest economy struggles to deal with the spread of the virus and its economic consequences. U.S. health officials have called on Beijing to be more proactive and share public health data globally in order to better contain and monitor the epidemic. At a press conference on Monday, Rochelle Valensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said that China \"has not yet shared\" complete information about the virus and its spread. \"We must have transparency and data to inform our public health response.\" While other countries have opened up their data, China has not yet done so. \"If we had this information and access to Chinese data, we would have a more complete understanding of the virus,\" she said. Valensky's comments come weeks after the World Health Organization (WHO) also raised concerns about China's lack of transparency. At a press conference on December 15, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that China has not yet \"fully opened up its data and shared the full genome sequence of the virus\". In the same press conference, Gebreyesus said that he and WHO officials \"emphasised\" China's need for more transparency to help the global fight against the virus. He said China's \"complete transparency\" was \"critical\" in making the world better aware of the virus and its potential mutations. China's lack of transparency has also raised concerns in other countries. Dr Harsh Vardhan, India's health minister, said in a December 11 statement that while India is \"extremely concerned\" about the situation in China, \"more information is needed\" to understand the spread of the virus and contain it. The United States also said it was concerned about Beijing's lack of transparency and a lack of adequate understanding of the potential impact of the virus. In a December 20 statement, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he was \"deeply concerned\" by China's \"intransparency\" and called on China to \"cooperate with the United States and the international community\" on the issue. Despite growing calls for greater transparency, China has yet to respond. Beijing views the virus as a global problem, and it has cooperated with WHO and other global health organizations. However, due to the lack of data from Beijing, some health officials and observers have expressed doubts about it, pointing out that the true extent of the outbreak may be obscured. This suspicion is exacerbated by reported attempts by certain Chinese health officials to conceal or downplay the severity of the epidemic. China's lack of transparency has also raised concerns about a new wave of global infections. While the virus has been circulating in China since late 2019, the true extent of the outbreak remains largely unknown. Public health experts warn that the world risks further outbreaks without a clearer understanding of the virus and its mutations, which can be difficult to control and treat. And without greater transparency from China, the risk of more outbreaks and further economic losses will only increase.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "the Lion's The Chicago Bears took a hard lesson in the first half of their first open match against the Detroit Lions at Soldier Field on Sunday night. In the fight between two of NFC's biggest rivals north, the Bears found themselves halfway behind the Lions 21-14 despite a historic performance by quarterback Justin Fields. Phils was the second overall choice in the 2021 NFL draft, with a show for the main audience in the first half. He scored 162 yards and two touchdowns, and played 107 yards on 10 carriers. It was the most sought-after field for the Bears quarterback in the first half since 1946 and the most of all bear players since the NFL-AFL merger in 1970. Despite the strong performance in the first half, the Bears found themselves behind the lion on the scoreboard. The Lions led the second round of the race, with quarterback Jared Goff directing an 8-game, a 75-yard drive that ended in a 15-yard touch pass. However, the Bears quickly answered that question, with 9 games and a 75-yard drive limited by a 17-yard ground pass from Fields to Allen Robinson's wide receiver. The Lions then played the next two games on the ground. Run back to Adrian Peterson, who scored from two yards and led 14-7, while the newcomer D'Andre Swift finished the game with six 59 yards at a speed that pushed the Lions forward by 21-7 with four yards of shooting speed. However, the Bears once again discovered the finish area before the semi-final. The 14-yard touch pass connected tight Cole Kemet's venue, reducing the Lions' lead to 21-14. At the beginning of the second half, the Bears faced third and 11 from their own 24-yard line. They called a time interval to discuss their match calls, and when they came out of the break, Fields hit wide receiver Darnell Mooney, moving along the slope route 15 yards for the first time down. However, the car eventually stalled as the Bears had to meet Robbie Gould's field goal in order to reach 21-17. Since then, the game has been tense and both sides' defenses have forced three outings. However, the Lions once again found the finish line in a 75-yard drive of nine games, completed by Swift's four-yard touchdown. With the Lions leading 28-17, Bears had another chance to make things happen, but Fields was intercepted when the Bears eventually owned the game and won a victory for Detroit. The loss was a disappointing end to the impressive performance on the pitch. He ended the game with 286 passes and two touchdowns, as well as 122 jumpfields and one touchdown. The Bears will seek to rebound next week as they travel to Green Bay to replace the packers. But now, they have to accept the wrong result of scoring 28-17 in their home opening tickets.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "The Chicago Bears have turned from a potential Super Bowl competitor into a potential first two draft right. The team announced Tuesday that Justin Fields, the second-ranked quarterback in the 2021 NFL draft, would miss the remainder of the regular season due to a knee injury. In his absence, the team will begin recruiting veteran Nathan Peterman during week 18 and beyond, as the Bears hope to win the first two draft titles in the 2022 NFL draft. Fields, who was taken away by Trevor Lawrence in the draft, is expected to be the face of a franchise for the foreseeable future. But former Ohio Bucky suffered an MCL shock when it lost to the Minnesota Vikings last week, and the Bears decided to close him for the rest of the regular season. \"The safety and well-being of our players is critical,\" said Ryan Pace, the Bears general manager, in a statement. \"We think it's best to be cautious with Justin and shut him down for the rest of the regular season.\" The Bears started the season with hopes of a playoff and now find themselves in trouble. At 5-9, they qualify for one of the first two drafts in the 2022 NFL Draft, but their chances of doing so depend on Peterman's performance. The 27-year-old was signed by the Bears in late October after being released under the Buffalo Act. He has not cast a regular pass since 2018, but he will start playing for the rest of the season. \"We have full confidence in Nathan's ability to execute the attack and lead the team,\" Pace said. \"Nathan is a talented passer, with extensive experience in the offensive. We look forward to seeing him play and finish this season at a high profile.\" If they want to win the first two in the draft, the Bears will face a difficult task. Their last three games were against the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Baltimore Raptors and the New Orleans Saints as playoffs. But if they manage to get out of the turmoil in any one of those games, they may be at the top of the list for robbing a franchise to change players, such as Trevor Lawrence of Clemson, Mac Jones of Alabama or Justin Fields of Ohio State University. The Bears will focus on the task at hand, starting in their 18th week against Jaguar. Despite their current position, the team remains determined to end the season with a high profile. \"We want to take advantage of this opportunity to play and race every week, regardless of our record,\" said coach Matt Nagy. \"We are focused on ending the season as strong as we can.\" However, the team can still play an important role in determining how the top of the 2022 NFL draft will swing.

And there was a kind of a discomfort too. Somehow we were trying to think, well, who would resolve something like this.

There was no evidence of widespread election fraud in the election.\n\n\u201cI was frustrated that I thought Vice President Pence might concede earlier than what President Trump was inclined to do,\u201d Thomas said, according to a transcript released Friday. \u201cAnd I wanted to hear Vice President Pence talk more about the fraud and irregularities in certain states that I thought was still lingering.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t focused on the Vice President\u2019s role on January 6th,\u201d she said, when asked specifically if the text \u2013 previously reported by CNN \u2013 was connected to how he handled that day.\n\nAt another point in the interview, committee member Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, asked Thomas what specific episodes of fraud concerned her.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say that I was familiar at that time with any specific evidence,\u201d she said, pointing instead to what she heard from \u201cfriends on the ground\u201d and \u201cgrassroots activists\u201d who had \u201cfound things suspicious\u201d at polling places.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know specific instances,\u201d she said. \u201cBut certainly I think we all know that there are people questioning what happened in 2020, and it takes time to develop an understanding of the facts.\u201d\n\nThe committee had only limited questions about Thomas\u2019 interactions with her husband and his role on the Supreme Court \u2013 an area she would likely be able to decline to answer questions about, given the confidentiality allowed for married couples.\n\nHer husband had no idea she was texting Meadows, Thomas told the investigators.\n\n\u201cHe first learned of my text messaging with Mark Meadows in March when he was in the hospital and this committee released them,\u201d she said in her interview.\n\nThomas said she regretted text messages sent to Mark Meadows after 2020 election\n\nGinni Thomas told the House select committee she regretted the text messages she was sending to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows after the election.\n\n\u201cI regret the tone and content of these texts \u2026 I really find my language imprudent and my choices of sending the context of these emails unfortunate,\u201d Thomas said.\n\nThomas\u2019 mea culpa to the committee, captured in a transcript of her September interview that was released publicly Friday, marks a rare moment of public reflection from one of the more intriguing avenues the House panel pursued, after obtaining Meadows\u2019 texts. Thomas, a longtime conservative activist, had been sending Meadows messages about challenging the election results. She explained to the committee at her interview she was concerned about a concession of the election before accusations of fraud were fully explored.\n\n\u201cIt was an emotional time. I was probably just emoting,\u201d she said, in response to direct questions from committee member Adam Schiff, a California Democrat. \u201cSome of these are just things I was showing were moving through the movement and I\u2019m regretting that they became public \u2026 Certainly I didn\u2019t want my emotional texts to a friend released and made available.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for Thomas said in a statement Friday that her \u201cpost-election activities\u201d after Trump lost in 2020 were \u201cminimal and mainstream.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer minimal activity was focused on ensuring that reports of fraud and irregularities were investigated,\u201d attorney Mark Paoletta said in the statement. \u201cBeyond that, she played no role in any events following the 2020 election. She also condemned the violence on January 6.\u201d\n\nKey witness Tony Ornato tells committee he didn\u2019t recall details, citing \u2018fog of war\u2019\n\nOne of the key witnesses in the House committee\u2019s investigation, former White House deputy chief of staff Tony Ornato, told the panel he couldn\u2019t recall details from January 6, amid what he called \u201cthe fog of war\u201d during the US Capitol attack.\n\nOrnato has been a central figure in the investigation since former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson testified that he relayed to her how the then-president angrily tried to redirect his motorcade to the Capitol that day \u2013 another detail that Ornato told the committee he didn\u2019t recall.\n\nOrnato told the committee that most of his job on January 6 involved relaying information he received to then-chief of staff Meadows and said he couldn\u2019t recall specific details when asked about who was trying to encourage Trump to send out a statement that day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you, it was a very chaotic time in trying to get the information, and it was usually late information or it wasn\u2019t accurate or it was the fog of war and it was misrepresented. And it was very \u2013 a very chaotic day, so I don\u2019t recall those specific details,\u201d Ornato said.\n\nDuring a public hearing in June, Hutchinson testified that Ornato told her Trump was angry he couldn\u2019t go to the Capitol on January 6 after his speech at the Ellipse and that, during the ride back to the White House, he reached toward the front of the car to grab at the steering wheel.\n\nAccording to Ornato\u2019s November testimony to the committee, which was released Friday, Ornato did not recall the conversation with Hutchinson and said he was \u201cshocked\u201d by her testimony.\n\n\u201cI was called to put it on,\u201d Ornato told the committee, referring to Hutchinson\u2019s televised testimony, \u201cand I was shocked and surprised of her testimony and called Mr. Engel and asked him, \u2018What is she talking about?\u2019\u201d\n\nOrnato said that Robert Engel, the lead Secret Service agent in Trump\u2019s motorcade on the day of the US Capitol attack, didn\u2019t know what Hutchinson was referring to. Hutchinson testified that Ornato relayed the story about Trump\u2019s outburst to her back at the White House, while Engel was in the room.\n\nThe committee makes clear in its final report it did not find Ornato\u2019s testimony credible.\n\nTrump attorney questioned statistics on supposed dead voters in 2020 election\n\nAn attorney on Trump\u2019s post-election legal team questioned some of the statistics being used to support claims of mass fraud, pointing out that many supposedly dead voters in Georgia likely sent in their ballots before they died, according to a January 6 committee transcript released Friday.\n\nThe committee read an email from the attorney, Katherine Friess, to Giuliani during the panel\u2019s interview with him. In the email, Friess weighed in on a chart being prepared for Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican.\n\n\u201cMany of the dead voters on the Georgia list sent their vote in before they passed. I don\u2019t think this makes a particularly strong case, and I think it\u2019s possible that Chairman Graham will push back on that,\u201d Friess said in the email, according to the committee investigators who were questioning Giuliani.\n\nCNN previously reported that another Trump lawyer, Christina Bobb, told the committee that Graham promised to \u201cchampion\u201d Trump\u2019s election fraud claims, saying: \u201cJust give me five dead voters.\u201d And Georgia election officials told Trump they found two votes cast in the names of dead people, not 5,000 as the former president suggested.\n\nFriess said in her email that she was raising the issue so that everyone is aware of \u201cwhat the data actually says.\u201d Hundreds of names on the list were of people who had died after their ballot was received, according to the committee\u2019s description of the chart.\n\nAn attorney who represented Friess in litigation she brought to block a committee subpoena of her phone records did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s inquiry about her email.\n\nTrump White House liaison denies she was banned from Justice Department\n\nA Trump administration official who was accused of trying to access sensitive Justice Department election-related information denied in testimony to the committee that she was barred from entering the DOJ\u2019s building, as was reported at the time.\n\nHeidi Stirrup, who was working as the White House liaison to the DOJ during the 2020 election, said that her badge to enter in the building was deactivated briefly in November 2020, but that after a day or two it was reactivated and she was able to reenter the building.\n\nIn her deposition with the committee, Stirrup recounted conversations she had with then-Attorney General Bill Barr and another DOJ official when she was seeking information about what the department was doing to investigate voter fraud allegations after the 2020 election. She told congressional investigators that she \u201ctook it upon\u201d herself to talk to the DOJ officials about how the department was approaching the allegations, after being asked by \u201cfriends\u201d not in the federal government what was going on.\n\nStirrup told the committee that Will Levi, the other DOJ official she spoke to, shared with her a memo Barr sent to the department outlining the authority that US attorneys had to investigate allegations presented to them in their state. According to the transcript, Stirrup emailed that memo to various other Trump administration officials \u2013 including John Zadrozny and John McEntee, who both worked in the White House. She told the committee that she couldn\u2019t recall having conversations with any of those individuals about DOJ\u2019s investigations into the allegations, and said she shared with them the memo because she thought they would be interested in it.\n\nFormer Trump campaign aide said he hadn\u2019t intended to be on \u2018team crazy\u2019\n\nRobert Sinners, who worked on the Trump campaign\u2019s Election Day operations in Georgia in 2020 and helped organize the slate of alternate GOP electors there, told congressional investigators that his \u201cintent was never to be aligned with team crazy.\u201d\n\nSinners said he was assured that lawyers had signed off on the alternate elector plan and didn\u2019t realize that numerous lawyers working with the Trump campaign had soured on the electors idea by the time the fake electors were convening on December 14, 2020, according to a transcript released Friday night.\n\nIn hindsight \u2013 after more fully understanding the extent of the schemes to overturn the 2020 election and the reservations some Trump attorneys had about these plots \u2013 Sinners told investigators he was both \u201cashamed\u201d to have helped organize the fake electors and \u201cangry.\u201d\n\nCNN previously reported that Sinners emailed the fake electors asking for \u201ccomplete secrecy and discretion\u201d on December 13, 2020, a day before the GOP electors convened at the Georgia capitol. Sinners told the panel that efforts to ensure Georgia\u2019s GOP electors met in secrecy had more to do with skirting Covid-19 restrictions and avoiding protesters than keeping the elector plan under wraps.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details Friday.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe official start to hurricane season is just a week away and forecasters are predicting another busy one.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Climate Prediction Center on Tuesday forecast 14 to 21 named storms, six to 10 hurricanes and three to six major hurricanes \u2013 of Category 3 strength or greater.\n\nThe 2020 and 2021 seasons both exhausted the hurricane name list and broke records. No one can say for sure if this year will be similar, but in early April, Colorado State University released its numbers, which were right in line with what NOAA is forecasting.\n\nThe CSU forecast called for 19 named storms, nine hurricanes and four major storms.\n\nAfter back-to-back years of using all the hurricane names and resorting to the Greek alphabet, the World Meteorological Organization decided to do away with using the Greek alphabet and made another list of names to be used if all the hurricane names are exhausted once again.\n\nOf course it\u2019s impossible to know how many of those storms will make landfall along the US coast, or where the largest storms will develop.\n\nHowever, during the announcement, NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad recognized that the current hurricane cycle for the Atlantic is a busy one.\n\n\u201cIf you go back two years, the 2020 hurricane season broke records across the board and it\u2019s the most active season on record with 30 named storms,\u201d said Spinrad.\n\n\u201cThe 2021 hurricane season, which is the third most active year on record in terms of names of storms brought us 21 named storms with impacts, ranging from the Appalachian Mountains all the way to New England, resulting in over $78.5 billion in US damage.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s driving the above-average seasons\n\nThere are several contributing factors that play into a \u201cbusy\u201d hurricane season. \u201cWe are in an active period,\u201d said Spinrad. \u201cThere are certain ingredients that drive the intensity and the frequency of hurricanes.\u201d\n\nOne is the existing La Ni\u00f1a conditions in the equatorial Pacific. This phenomenon creates cooler-than-average ocean temperatures around the equator in the Pacific and results in weather impacts around the globe.\n\nLa Ni\u00f1a presents favorable conditions for hurricanes \u2013 in contrast to that of El Ni\u00f1o.\n\nHurricane seasons under El Ni\u00f1o conditions are known for upper-level wind patterns across the Caribbean that tear hurricanes apart as they try to form, making the seasons less active.\n\nAnother reason for the above-normal forecast is the location of what\u2019s called the \u201cGulf Loop Current.\u201d This current is \u201ca 600-foot-deep river of hot Caribbean water that travels between Cancun, Mexico and western Cuba into the Gulf,\u201d said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers.\n\nThis loop current is flowing farther north now, forcing warm water at deeper levels of the ocean to travel closer to the coastal areas along the Gulf of Mexico. \u201cThe warm water is simply too deep and the hurricane has an unlimited supply of hot water for intensification,\u201d said Myers.\n\nForecasters are comparing the position of the loop current with where it was placed in the record-breaking 2005 season \u2013 when Hurricanes Katrina and Rita both made landfall.\n\n\u201cYes, the loop current does look like 2005,\u201d said Matthew Rosencrans, lead hurricane season outlook forecaster with NOAA\u2019s Climate Prediction Center. \u201cBut it depends if a storm actually moves over that loop current and forecasting the specific track of storms is not something we can do beyond a week time frame,\u201d Rosencrans added.\n\nBack-to-back record-breaking years\n\nDuring the 2021 hurricane season, eight storms made landfall along the US Gulf Coast and in 2020 six made landfall along the Gulf.\n\nIn 2020, Hurricanes Laura and Delta both slammed into southwest Louisiana, making landfall roughly 15 miles apart.\n\nWhat to do if you are in the path of a hurricane\n\n\u201cIn 2021, Hurricane Ida ripped through Southeast Louisiana, then caused more catastrophic damage in the Northeast.\n\n\u201cHurricane Ida spanned nine states, demonstrating that anyone can be in the direct path of a hurricane and in danger from the remnants of a storm system,\u201d said FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell. \u201cIt\u2019s important for everyone to understand their risk.\u201d", "label": "human"}
{"text": "watch now\n\nFTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was sent back to a Bahamas jail Monday in a chaotic courtroom scene, after a reported plan for him to waive his extradition to the U.S. stalled. However, multiple media reports later in the day said that he had told his Bahamian lawyer to proceed with extradition hearings, and he's now expected back in court later this week. Reports over the weekend indicated that Bankman-Fried would consent to extradition, but the former crypto billionaire told a different story Monday, demanding to see a copy of his federal indictment before agreeing to return to the U.S. He will return to Fox Hill jail rather than surrendering himself to U.S. custody. Bankman-Fried's legal team signaled that they would fight extradition last week. CNBC and several other outlets reported that Bankman-Fried had changed his mind and would instead submit himself for extradition on Monday.\n\nFTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (C) is led away handcuffed by officers of the Royal Bahamas Police Force at the Nassau, Bahamas, courthouse on December 19, 2022. Kris Ingraham | Afp | Getty Images\n\nIn open court, chaos reigned. Bankman-Fried, 30, dressed in a blue suit and white button-down shirt, was visibly shaking. His Bahamian defense attorney., Jerone Roberts, told the court that he was \"shocked\" that Bankman-Fried was in court. \"I did not request him to be here this morning,\" the attorney said. Franklyn Williams KC, the Bahamian prosecutor, said that he \"understood that [Bankman-Fried] intended to waive extradition,\" according to an NBC News producer present in the courtroom. The FTX founder arrived at Bahamian court in a convoy of police vehicles, heavily guarded, just after 10 a.m. ET.\n\nwatch now\n\nAfter the hearing closed, the New York Times and Washington Post both reported that Bankman-Fried agreed to extradition, citing Roberts. \"We as counsel will prepare the necessary documents to trigger the court,\" Mr. Roberts told the Times. CNBC has not yet been able to confirm these reports independently. The move comes just days after he was remanded to the medical unit of Bahamas' notorious Fox Hill Prison. The State Department in a 2020 report called the conditions at Fox Hill Prison \"harsh,\" citing \"overcrowding, poor nutrition, inadequate sanitation, poor ventilation, and inadequate medical care.\"\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, founder of FTX, is escorted inside of the Magistrate's Court in Nassau, Bahamas, on Monday, Dec. 19, 2022. Victor J. Blue | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nMedical care in particular is spotty at the Bahamian prison, the report said. The former billionaire was transported from one of his several multimillion-dollar penthouse homes to the prison last week \u2014 though Bankman-Fried was entitled to his own room in the medical wing, Bloomberg reported. Bankman-Fried faces life in federal prison, without the possibility of supervised release, if convicted on just one of eight offenses that prosecutors have charged him with. His sentence could be reduced by mitigating factors. Trial lawyers and former prosecutors say that, in practice, many white-collar defendants are given lesser sentences than what the guidelines dictate. So, even in large fraud cases, you can see life sentences drastically reduced. WATCH: Why Sam Bankman-Fried may decide to drop his fight against being extradited to the U.S.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "La mejor forma de superar la cuesta de enero es consiguiendo que ning\u00fan otro enero se haga tan empinada. \u00bfC\u00f3mo? Con una buena planificaci\u00f3n, un presupuesto y un h\u00e1bito de ahorro.\n\nSiempre podr\u00e1s encontrarte con eventos econ\u00f3micos externos que tensen m\u00e1s o menos tu situaci\u00f3n financiera, como la inflaci\u00f3n. Sin embargo, incluso la inflaci\u00f3n se puede combatir con una buena planificaci\u00f3n. Y no necesitas un asesor financiero para hacerlo, t\u00fa mismo puedes construirlo desde cero.\n\nSi las finanzas personales siguen siendo tu asignatura pendiente, estos 7 trucos te ayudar\u00e1n a empezar el a\u00f1o con buen pie y un s\u00f3lido prop\u00f3sito de a\u00f1o nuevo.\n\n1. Incluye el gasto de la cuesta de enero en tu presupuesto\n\nAsume que vas a tener que superar los m\u00e1s de 600 euros que te has dejado en las navidades (y los d\u00edas que quedan). Incluye esta partida en tu presupuesto personal para no arrastrarla el resto del a\u00f1o y empieza a ahorrar para cuando lleguen las Navidades de 2024.\n\nSi no sabes qu\u00e9 es un presupuesto personal, aqu\u00ed tienes toda la informaci\u00f3n que necesitas, una plantilla de hoja de c\u00e1lculo y una gu\u00eda para empezar a ahorrar para cumplir el mejor prop\u00f3sito financiero que puedas ponerte este a\u00f1o.\n\n2. C\u00e9ntrate en recortar gastos\n\nSi no puedes aumentar tus ingresos en enero, tu estrategia se tiene que centrar en recortar gastos. Tambi\u00e9n puedes buscar formas de rentabilizar el dinero que tienes ahorrado, pero antes necesitar\u00e1s un colch\u00f3n de emergencia para hacer frente a un a\u00f1o con signos de recesi\u00f3n.\n\nEntre tanto, recorta todos los gastos innecesarios y reduce aquellos que m\u00e1s pesan en tu registro de gastos. Las compras de primeras marcas en el supermercado, la gasolina, los caprichos y vicios...\n\n3. Evita las aberraciones que te hacen gastar m\u00e1s dinero en el supermercado\n\nAunque el nuevo decreto anticrisis incluye un IVA del 0% para alimentos de primera necesidad, a\u00fan no es un buen momento para ir al supermercado sin una lista de la compra, con hambre y sin tiempo.\n\nEsas son las t\u00edpicas aberraciones que siempre te hacen gastar m\u00e1s en el supermercado y que son m\u00e1s dif\u00edciles de rectificar porque se han convertido en un mal h\u00e1bito.\n\n4. Si no has ahorrado para las rebajas, abstente de cualquier compra innecesaria\n\nLas rebajas son todos los a\u00f1os en las mismas fechas. Por lo que si eres de las personas que aprovecha este momento para renovar el armario de verano y de invierno, las rebajas tienen que formar parte de tu presupuesto.\n\nEvita tambi\u00e9n cualquier tentaci\u00f3n de comprarte algo que realmente no necesitas, como el vestido del evento del a\u00f1o. Si el descuento no es suculento, no tienes excusa.\n\n5. Redondea tus compras para ahorrar un poco m\u00e1s cada mes\n\nSi lo que m\u00e1s te cuesta no es dejar de comprar si no ahorrar una cantidad determinada cada mes, empieza a ponerle trampas a tu cerebro para ahorrar sin darte cuenta y valorar a medio largo plazo los beneficios que tiene separar dinero cada mes para el futuro.\n\nUno de los trucos m\u00e1s conocidos para ahorrar sin hacer grandes sacrificios es el redondeo de tus compras. No se trata de que te hagan un reembolso por un pago con tu tarjeta, como el cashback, sino de que redondear el precio al euro para meter la diferencia en un monedero digital.\n\nPor ejemplo, si pagas 1,70 euros por un caf\u00e9, enviar\u00e1s a tu monedero 0,30 c\u00e9ntimos.\n\n6. Aprovecha el A\u00f1o Nuevo para encontrar facturas m\u00e1s baratas\n\nNunca ha sido cierto eso de \"A\u00f1o Nuevo, vida nueva\", pero s\u00ed que uno tiene la sensaci\u00f3n de que algo comienza. Gusta limpiar la casa, tirar cosas viejas y pensar los prop\u00f3sitos que har\u00e1n del a\u00f1o que entra un a\u00f1o mejor que el anterior.\n\nMuchas de estas cosas se quedan ah\u00ed, a la v\u00edspera o en la primera semana del a\u00f1o nuevo. Pero otras pueden cambiar realmente tu realidad para los pr\u00f3ximos 365 d\u00edas. Como hacer una limpieza de armario y conseguir ingresos extra vendiendo la ropa de segunda mano o rebajar las facturas del hogar.\n\n7. Convierte el ahorro en un h\u00e1bito para no volver a pasar por lo mismo el a\u00f1o que viene\n\nEste podr\u00eda ser el a\u00f1o que marque un antes y un despu\u00e9s en tus finanzas incluso con una posible recesi\u00f3n a la vuelta de la esquina. Programa tu primera transferencia autom\u00e1tica para beneficiarte del truco del preahorro o recurre al ahorro progresivo si a\u00fan te cuesta guardar dinero para el futuro.\n\nOtra forma de asegurarte que no volver\u00e1s a tener una cuesta de enero imposible es registrando todos tus gastos e ingresos para tener un presupuesto personal realista en 2024.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are not the only couple who have suffered severe discrimination over interracial marriage. I can also be associated with this type of discrimination, because I am an American model married to a Nigerian prince. I grew up in a small town in California and relatively avoided many of the world's problems before moving to England. I dated my husband for several years, who told me he was a Nigerian prince. His father was a powerful politician in Nigeria, and his mother was an American diplomat. Oladipo was born and raised in the United States, but is still considered a prince because of his royal legacy. We decided to move to London to start our lives together and avoid any potential bias in the United States. We thought moving to Britain would be a safe haven for us, but our experience in the country soon proved that racism was still deeply entrenched. When we first arrived in London, we were welcomed by a cultural shock. I remember walking around the street and being stared at by locals who were shocked by our presence. More disturbingly, as we passed along, some people began to whisper derogatory words. It didn't take long for us to realize that racism was more than just a fictional thing we imagined. We have experienced its forms of discrimination in the workplace, lack of response to job applications, and even occasional racist remarks from strangers. When Meghan Markle married Prince Harry, we knew immediately that the couple would suffer the same discrimination as us. They were already targets of racism and hatred when their relationship was first announced. We have accepted the fact that racism still exists in society, and are more resistant to our impact. And we also have an incredible support system in Britain where friends and family have embraced us and supported our marriage. Cross-racial couples like Meghan and Prince Harry still face discrimination and prejudice, even in a country that prides itself on tolerance. While things are far from perfect, I'm proud of my marriage and the strength that cross-racial couples need to overcome obstacles.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Luister hieronder naar de audioversie van dit artikel\n\n15 15 0:00 4:13\n\nInspanningsfysioloog Tom Holland moedigt iedereen aan om te gaan hardlopen als het buiten koud is.\n\nHardlopen in de winter helpt om je immuunsysteem te verbeteren tijdens de donkere maanden.\n\nHolland stelt dat de kou je lichaam minder belast vergeleken met hardlopen als het warm is.\n\nLees ook: Fit worden zonder uren in de sportschool door te brengen? Zo haal je het maximale uit korte workouts\n\nTerwijl de meeste gelegenheidslopers ervoor kiezen om binnen te blijven als het kouder wordt, is de winter volgens inspanningsfysioloog Tom Holland eigenlijk een van de beste tijden om te gaan hardlopen.\n\nHij beweert dat hardlopen in de kou niet alleen grote voordelen heeft, maar ook veel minder stressvol voor je lichaam is dan wanneer het buiten warm is.\n\nHolland vertelt Insider dat hardlopen in de kou je humeur kan verbeteren en zelfs je immuunsysteem versterkt tegen winterkwalen.\n\nHardlopen in winter: draag een nauwsluitende eerste laag, muts en handschoenen\n\nHolland, die de podcast Fitness Disrupted presenteert, zegt dat er een paar dingen zijn om te overwegen als je gaat hardlopen in de winter. Ten eerste wil je lichaamsdelen zoals je handen en oren warm houden.\n\n\"Als je naar een marathon kijkt op een koude dag, hebben de toplopers hempjes en korte broeken aan. Maar ook mutsen en handschoenen\", zegt hij.\n\nIn de kou geeft het lichaam prioriteit aan het opwarmen van de centrale delen van je lijf. Dit trekt bloed weg van de lichaamsdelen die het verst van je hart verwijderd zijn.\n\nJe wilt natuurlijk wel dat je ledematen warm blijven, maar hoe warm verschilt per persoon en hoe koud het buiten is. Hoewel je het niet ijskoud moet hebben als je naar buiten gaat, wil je het wel koud hebben. Je lichaam warmt namelijk snel op van het hardlopen.\n\nHolland adviseert een nauwsluitende eerste laag voor je bovenlichaam. Dit kan volgens hem zelfs als de temperatuur onder het vriespunt zakt, voldoende zijn. Daar overheen kun je een lossere laag doen voor je bovenlichaam als het echt koud is. Daar kan nog een windjack bij als het extremer weer is.\n\nEen tot twee lagen zijn meestal genoeg voor je onderlichaam, zegt hij.\n\nVoordeel 1: je levert waarschijnlijk betere prestaties\n\nEen van de beste redenen om in de kou te lopen is dat je waarschijnlijk sneller loopt en je beter voelt dan wanneer je in de hitte zou lopen, stelt Holland.\n\nTemperatuurregeling tijdens het hardlopen is stressvol voor ons lichaam, zegt hij. En dit wordt erger naarmate het warmer wordt, omdat je bloed zich dan verplaatst van het centrale deel naar je huid om zweet te produceren. Dit proces onttrekt bloed aan ons hart, terwijl we daar bij het hardlopen juist een extra beroep op doen.\n\nVolgens Holland is de temperatuurregeling van het lichaam bij kouder weer niet contraproductief, zoals bij warmer weer wel het geval is. Het lichaam stuurt bij lagere temperaturen namelijk juist bloed naar de kern en het hart. De optimale buitentemperatuur zou rond de 10 graden Celsius liggen, stelt de inspanningsfysioloog.\n\nEenduidig onderzoek over de hoeveelheid calorie\u00ebn die je verbrandt bij hardlopen in koud weer, is er niet. Maar Holland denkt dat je jezelf sowieso meer pusht als het kouder is, omdat je je dan beter voelt.\n\nVoordeel 2: hardlopen in de kou kan je humeur verbeteren\n\nHolland zegt dat hij mensen vooral aanraadt te gaan hardlopen in de kou, omdat ze zich er mentaal beter door zullen voelen. Lichaamsbeweging zoals hardlopen zorgt ervoor dat verschillende stemmingsverbeterende stoffen vrijkomen, zoals endorfine, dopamine en serotonine.\n\nDe koudere maanden zijn ook een tijd waarin we minder naar buiten willen, zegt Holland. Maar juist dan is het eigenlijk heel belangrijk dat we dat wel doen. Als de dagen korter worden, komen aandoeningen zoals seizoensgebonden depressies veel vaker voor.\n\nSporten in de natuur heeft volgens Holland een nog groter voordeel voor de geestelijke gezondheid dan binnen bewegen.\n\n\"Als je kijkt naar de uitkomsten van onderzoek naar bewegen in de natuur, zouden mensen het juist vaker willen doen nadat ze eenmaal buiten zijn geweest. Je bent geneigd er meer van te genieten en zult het daardoor vaker willen doen\", zegt hij.\n\nVoordeel 3: Bewegen in de kou kan goed zijn voor je immuunsysteem.\n\nElke vorm van fysieke activiteit is goed voor je gezondheid, zegt Holland. Uit onderzoek blijkt dat een gebrek aan beweging in de winter je vatbaarder kan maken voor ziekten.\n\nUit onderzoek komt ook naar voren dat blootstelling aan omstandigheden zoals kou kan helpen om beter om te gaan met stress in het algemeen.\n\nHolland zegt dat het belangrijk is om je lichaam uit te dagen om gezond te blijven. Vooral op dagen dat je eigenlijk binnen wilt blijven en minder beweegt.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "It's an ambitious modern architectural project - an inner city tower surrounded by lush greenery and a bright future for its residents. But instead, residents of Manchester's \"lucky\" tower in the UK find themselves trapped in a building covered by insecurity, facing soaring living costs and an uncertain future. \"It was sold as a dream,\" said Ella Johnston, 25, who moved into the tower in 2018, \"but it turned out to be a nightmare.\" The Lucky Tower was built in the mid-2000s as part of a project to rebuild economically disadvantaged parts of Manchester.The building is fashioned, modern and energy efficient, and promises to provide good employment opportunities and transport links to the city center. In 2019, the building's coverage did not comply with fire safety regulations.The Manchester City Council immediately issued a notice to residents of the building warning that the tower was unsafe and had to be evacuated as soon as possible. Residents of the Lucky Tower have no choice but to move out - but with rents elsewhere in the city reaching historic highs, the cost of living has skyrocketed and for many, the cost of moving is too high. For Ella and her neighbors, the only option was to stay in the building waiting for help from parliament or government. But as months went by, that help didn't materialise, leaving residents with no choice but to stay where they were told it wasn't safe. Their only option is to borrow or use savings to pay rents and bills. But with coverage problems and delays in the government's failure to act, many residents of Luck Tower find themselves in impossible situations without money and hope. \"We feel forgotten and alone,\" Ella said. \"For the government, the wall issue seems to be invisible and unthinkable. But for us, it's very real. We live in an unsafe building, but there is no way out.\" Then, in 2021, the government finally announced an independent investigation into the wall scandal. An investigation led by Baroness Wilcox began at the end of 2021 and has been heard from the victims of the scandal, including Luck Tower residents. The survey gave residents the opportunity to talk about their experiences, and many did so with heartbreaking emotions. Ella was particularly outspoken about the government's role in the wall crisis and its impact on the lucky tower's residents. \"We're stuck,\" she said, \"we live in nothing and pay too much rent and bills to live in a building that poses a threat to our security. It's a day-to-day struggle we shouldn't face.\" The investigation is still ongoing and no verdict has been handed down. But for the residents of Luck Tower, the psychological damage from the wall scandal has been completed. \"It's been a tough couple of years,\" says Ella. \"When you don't know if or when it will help, it's hard to stay positive. We just want to be able to go on with our lives.\" The government has promised to do the right thing for the victims of the wall scandal, and the investigation is a first step in that direction. But for Ella and other residents of Luck Tower, the wait continues. \"We just hope things change soon,\" she said, \"we just want to be able to continue our lives.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Russian troops were reportedly killed in a devastating HIMARS strike as some of their soldiers allegedly used mobile phones and revealed their location. The attack took place in Syria late last week when missiles hit a target in the town of Ain Issa, near the country's northern border. The attack is believed to have been carried out by U.S.-backed forces, with reports that the area was hit by a HIMARS missile system. The Russian military said the attack was made possible because some of their troops had been using their phones, allowing U.S.-backed forces to locate them and launch strikes. At least three Russian soldiers were killed and another three wounded in the attack. The incident comes amid heightened tensions between the United States and Russia, both of which accuse each other of escalating the conflict in Syria. The United States has accused the Russian military of supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's attacks on rebel-controlled areas in eastern Syria. Meanwhile, Russia has accused the United States of supporting anti-Assad forces, including the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). The incident comes at a time when Russian troops are increasingly involved in combat operations in Syria. Moscow has been providing military support to Damascus since 2015, helping the Syrian government regain large areas of territory previously controlled by rebels in the country. In recent months, Russian forces have been providing military assistance to the Syrian army in order to fight a major offensive by Islamic State (IS) militants in the eastern part of the country. The incident is a clear reminder of the dangers associated with using mobile phones on the battlefield, as it frees troops from position and makes them vulnerable to attack. The Russian military said in a statement that they were \"deeply concerned\" about the incident and would take steps to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. They also said they had \"taken U.S.-backed Syrian forces responsible for this attack\" and would \"take all necessary measures to ensure the safety of our service members.\" Meanwhile, the U.S. military declined to comment on the incident and said it was \"not aware that any U.S.-backed forces were involved in this attack.\" The incident is another reminder of the ongoing violence in Syria and the dangers posed by the use of mobile phones on the battlefield. It's also a reminder that the U.S. and Russia are increasingly divided over Syria, and could find themselves on the verge of conflict if tensions are not managed.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "It's no secret that 2020 will be a year of stock market volatility. As the coronavirus epidemic grips global markets, investors are rethinking how best to allocate funds, and many want to reduce volatility and deliver higher returns through retail investment. The latest figures from the Institute of Investment Companies (ICI) show that individual investors have been increasing their portfolios in October despite market volatility caused by the pandemic. According to ICI, retail investors poured $5.5 billion into equity mutual funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs) in October, up from $3.7 billion in September. With the uncertainty created by the outbreak, it is no surprise that more and more investors are choosing passive strategies such as ETFs and index funds. These strategies allow them to decentralize their portfolios without managing individual stocks. At the same time, retail investors have been taking advantage of recent market conditions, with aggressively managed funds showing inflows for the fourth straight month in October, according to ICI. The shift from passive to active sentiment among retail investors is largely driven by prospects for improved market conditions and higher returns. So what should investors pay attention to in the coming year? First, it's important to keep in mind the risks inherent in the stock market and investors should be prepared to lose some money. Nevertheless, there are still good opportunities for investors to take advantage of it. One of the areas that investors will be most concerned about in the coming year is technology stocks, with many retail investors using advances in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and other technologies to invest in companies that have the potential to make a significant impact in the coming years. Another area of focus that could gain momentum in 2023 is the cannabis industry. With increasing regulation in the US and Canada, investors are exploiting the growth potential of this sector. For those looking for stock alternatives, a marijuana-centric ETF can offer an easy way to diversify without taking too much risk. In addition, retail investors should look for momentum stocks, as well as small-cap shares that may experience explosive growth in the near future. Finally, it is important for retail investors to take advantage of the low interest rate environment. With interest rates still near historic lows, now is a good time for investors to consider bonds, especially those with high yields and more attractive returns than traditional investments. Ultimately, retail investors should keep in mind that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to investing. It is important to diversify, be patient and look for opportunities that match the investor's own risk tolerance and goals.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "When a politically charged committee's report on the January 6 U.S. congressional uprising was released Friday, many people would ask if they should read it. It's not a boring question: Some publishers have decided that the best way to make sure your report doesn't get forgotten any time soon is for as many people as possible to read and discuss it. Publishers including Melville House, Haymarket Books and Verso Books are now working to translate the findings of the congressional report into book length versions for widespread distribution. \"It's amazing to see so many people coming together to bring this report to the world,\" said Matt Weiland, editor-in-chief of Melville House, who led the work. \"We wanted to let people know what happened and make sure that the truth is not forgotten by history.\" The effort comes as much of the country remains divided over the January 6 incident, when a group of supporters of former President Donald Trump stormed into the Capitol to try to undermine the certification of President Joe Biden's victory. Five people were killed and dozens injured in the uprising. The goal of this lengthy report is to give more people access to information, says Waylan. This effort is being coordinated with major retailers to ensure that the report is widely used. \"We want everyone to have access to it,\" he said, \"and we want to make sure that the information is there and people can decide for themselves whether they want to participate or not.\" The bookmaster's report will include an overview of the January 6 incident, as well as a profile of those involved in the violence. It will also include sections on Congressional police and their response to the unrest, federal efforts to investigate the rebellion, and the impact of the attack on future civil unrest. While the publisher did not disclose which authors would be involved in the project, Weiland said that the report will be written in a way that is accessible to the public. He hopes that by making it available in a more user-friendly manner, it will stimulate further dialogue and discussion about the January 6 event. \"We want this to be a real discussion, not just a reading,\" he said. \"We want people to come back to the book and have further conversations about it.\" Since the investigation is still ongoing and may last for several months, it is not expected that this book will provide a clear description of what happened on January 6. But Willand said the book would be a good starting point for those who want to learn about the events of that day. \"It's something that needs to be discussed publicly,\" Willan said, \"and if we can do it then hopefully get some benefit from this terrible tragedy.\" The book will be released on December 17 and is expected to be widely distributed.The participating authors, publishers and booksellers want as many people as possible to read and reflect on the events of January 6. \"This is a truly shocking event for the nation,\" said Mitchell Cohen, executive director of Sea City Books, \"and we want to make sure that the events of January 6 don't disappear from public consciousness and that people understand the importance of this moment in our history.\"", "label": "machine"}

It has a more squared design, similar to the iPad Air and iPad Pro, with a large 10.9-inch screen, USB-C in place of the Lightning connector, and will ship in different colors like pink, yellow, blue and silver. Apple also announced a new $249 Magic Keyboard Folio case for the iPad that has a kickstand, a trackpad with support for multitouch and a magnetic connector that automatically charges it. But there's something strange about the Apple Pencil support. The new iPad doesn't work with the better second-generation Apple Pencil, which charges on the side of the iPad Air, iPad mini and iPad Pro. Since the new iPad uses USB-C instead of a Lightning port \u2014 which is used to charge the Apple Pencil on earlier models \u2014 you'll need to buy a $9 USB-C to Lightning adapter in order to charge the Apple Pencil. Apple will sell different configurations, including Wi-Fi only and WiFi + 5G cellular, but it starts at $449, which is a bump from the $329 starting price of the ninth-generation iPad.

Apple said it's up to 15% faster than the M1 processor used in the last model of the iPad Pro that was introduced in 2021. The Apple Pencil works a bit differently on the new iPad Pros, too. The screen can now detect the tip of the Pencil up to 12 mm above the surface of the screen.

The company believes this new service will revolutionize the way people experience outdoor activities and potentially save lives. The new service is easy to use and does not require additional settings. To activate it, users simply need to enable a new \"Emergency SOS Satellite Alert\" setting in their iPhone settings. Once enabled, the satellite beacon is triggered, allowing them to call for help when they are in trouble. The beacon can then be used to find this person and provide assistance if necessary. The technology behind the service was developed by Apple in partnership with satellite company Iridium and supported by the U.S. Department of Defense.Apple strives to ensure that the service is secure, as well as reliable and safe to use. This includes encrypting all data and running an additional layer of authentication. The service runs on the iPhone 12 and is expected to work on older models with the introduction of the technology in the coming months.The service can also be used in Canada and some countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America. This new service is a great tool for all kinds of hikers, campers and adventurers, allowing users to connect with the outside world in remote areas can make a difference in emergency situations. The service may also be useful for backpackers, climbers, runners and others who spend a lot of time outdoors. \"We are committed to helping our customers stay safe wherever they are,\" said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. \"This new service will make it easier than ever for people to stay connected and seek help in an emergency.\" Once users start the service, they will receive an estimated rescue arrival time as well as a real-time map view of their location. If the user needs help and cannot speak, it can also trigger a silent call for help, which will immediately contact the relevant authorities and provide them with the location of the user and other important information. Apple has made great efforts to create products that can truly change people's lives. By allowing users to send help calls from the most remote places, Apple has the potential to save countless lives. The service will be released later this month and will launch globally early next year.It is expected that the service will be available as an in-app purchase at prices not yet announced. In the coming months, we may see further development of the service, such as improved user experience and more comprehensive security measures. At present, Apple's new emergency SOS satellite alert service is the perfect tool to keep you safe from the grid. With it, you can enjoy peace in the wilderness and explore nature without fear.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "In the new Almost Famous musical, Penny Lane arrives in Scene III, when Cameron Crowe\u2019s stage direction says, \u201ca luminous girl emerges from the shadows.\u201d The play will spend the rest of the show chasing her\u2014and for the past three years, so has a team of makeup pros, hair artists, costume designers, and vintage clothing hunters. \u201cI\u2019ve been living on Etsy since 2019,\u201d says David Zinn, the Tony-nominated designer for the show. \u201cAnna Sui, Missoni. Those are the dream.\u201d\n\nBut Almost Famous has always been a dream, at least for the girls who grew up transfixed by its \u201cBand Aids\u201d and their careless heap of smeared, smoked-up glamour. Now 22 years after its film premiere, the story comes to Broadway, and while some music is different (think: Elton John and Led Zeppelin classics intertwined with original songs by Broadway veteran Tom Kitt), one key feeling from the film remains the same: When watching the show, you really want to pause the story and climb into it yourself. Since style is the closest thing humans get to teleports, the fashion and beauty looks in this show hit deep.\n\nBroadway\u2019s Penny Lane (Solea Pfeiffer), as imagined by Almost Famous costume designer David Zinn. David Zinn\n\nTo get them, Broadway Band Aids Solea Pfeiffer (Penny Lane), Katie Ladner (Sapphire), Jana Djenn\u00e9 Jackson (Polexia), and Julia Cassandra (Estrella) had daily fittings for their six to eight looks, which include pieces by Saloni, Camp Collection, and Alexis Bittar, plus one pair of epically embroidered bell bottoms. \u201cThere\u2019s a scene where I\u2019m smoking pot,\u201d says Ladner. \u201cSo, on my jeans, David embroidered a cockroach wearing a sweater and smoking a roach. It is the most incredible thing\u2014this bug smoking a blunt. The details in this show are astounding.\u201d They\u2019re also ever-changing, thanks to some character quirks approved by Crowe himself. \u201cWe\u2019re technically wearing something different every night,\u201d says Cassandra, \u201cBecause for every show, I\u2019ll match a scarf to the aura of the other Band Aids. Sometimes Katie is really pink, and sometimes Jana is really purple, you know?\u201d\n\nMore From ELLE\n\nThough the vibes\u2014and the purple auras\u2014are unchanged from the film, the cast is careful to point out that Broadway is a very different game, and they are therefore different players. \u201cOur director [Jeremy Herrin] made that very clear in the beginning,\u201d says Pfeiffer, who makes her Broadway debut in the role. \u201cHe said, \u2018This isn\u2019t an adaptation of the movie. This is another version of Cameron\u2019s story.\u201d And that was a relief, because obviously, I\u2019m not Kate Hudson. I mean, I\u2019m not white! I look nothing like her! I was given permission to really free myself and make Penny Lane my own.\u201d\n\nThe new Band Aids: Jana Djenn\u00e9 Jackson, Katie Ladner, and Julia Cassandra. David Zinn\n\nThat began with her makeup, which veered more into vintage showgirl than Hudson\u2019s babydoll rocker. \u201cI\u2019m a sucker for old-timey Broadway glamour,\u201d Pfeiffer says. \u201cTo me, Broadway is Barbra [Streisand] with the tips on her nails\u2014the long claws\u2014and the lashes, the gloss, the lustrous hair. I have loved Broadway culture and I have watched it and wanted to embody it my whole life. I wasn\u2019t gonna stop now! I mean, I finally got here!\u201d There are also practical reasons for Pfeiffer\u2019s piles of eyelashes and liquid liner. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a movie. There\u2019s no close-up here. I need people all the way in the back to see who Penny Lane is.\u201d\n\nBeauty artist Luc Verschueren created the hair and makeup for the show, and adds that Penny\u2019s inner light emerges through Charlotte Tilbury highlighter and Urban Decay\u2019s Almost Nude Foundation. \u201cPenny Lane makes out a lot,\u201d Pfeiffer laughs. \u201cPenny Lane hugs everyone. Penny Lane cries. And at first, I was like, \u2018How am I going to keep my makeup on through all of this?\u2019 But then I was like, \u2018You know, Penny Lane is living. There\u2019s gonna be a black mascara tear. There\u2019s gonna be lip gloss all over Russell Hammond after they kiss. He\u2019s a rock star; he can handle it. Let\u2019s lean into the heightened art form of theater, and of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing here, and it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s beautiful!\u2019\u201d (Faced with multiple quick changes, the other Band Aids use liberal mists of setting spray. \u201cIt really does the job,\u201d says Jackson. \u201cPolexia has these little freckles that I paint on every night to add some youth and innocence to her vibe. They\u2019re still there by the finale.\u201d)\n\nA scene from the San Diego production of Almost Famous. Neal Preston for Almost Famous Broadway\n\nTo get the Band Aid look at home, Verschueren suggests starting with the hair. \u201cIf you look at all the album covers, all the magazines, the hair is what tells you, \u2018I am rock \u2018n\u2019 roll,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThe easiest way to look like a Band Aid is to change your texture. You can use curlers\u2014just rag curls in your hair\u2014or, if you have a natural wave, you can try to bring it out. Think about Carole King\u2014lots of women have that wavy texture of hair, but she amplified it by dry-brushing it.\u201d For a slept-in curl, Sarah Potempa of recommends leaving the ends of your hair out of your iron or wand completely, which leads to a messier, sexier spiral.\n\nAs for makeup, Verschueren says that if you\u2019re actually going to a Stillwater show or a party at the Continental Riot House, think bronze. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of blue light at rock concerts and nightclubs,\u201d he says, \u201cWhich means there\u2019s also a lot of very blue light in our show. It\u2019s gorgeous, but for very fair people, like Katie [Ladner], the blue light makes the face go away, almost like a ghost. So I always try a warmer shade of powder, like a bronze. It might look a little strong in front of your own mirror, but when you\u2019re out, you will look like heaven.\u201d Ladner gets hers at Ulta, while Cassandra is a big fan of Fenty\u2019s brown and pink palettes.\n\nThe \u201cNo More Airplanes\u201d Tour. Almost Famous Broadway\n\nIn terms of the clothes, Zinn says it\u2019s mostly thrifted, with a few exceptions: Penny\u2019s iconic shearling coat (\u201cit\u2019s part magic carpet, part theatrical show curtain\u201d) was handmade especially for Pfeiffer in partnership with Curly Fur in Portland, Oregon. Sapphire wears a pair of star-stamped boots that were \u201ccustom-made to be as badass as possible.\u201d (Ditto for the crochet bikini worn by Penny at a pool scene in Arizona.) And some of Polexia\u2019s jewelry is the actress\u2019 own. \u201cI had my African waist beads on during my fitting,\u201d Jackson recalls. \u201cI thought they\u2019d tell me to take them off for the show, but they said, \u2018No, great, do you think Polexia would wear them?\u2019 And, hell yes, my Polexia would! I mean, this Polexia is a beautiful, Black young woman in 1973 hanging out with rock stars. Of course she does!\u201d\n\nAnd what about Penny\u2019s jeans\u2014surely they\u2019ve been rescued from a Goodwill in Troy, Michigan? \u201cThey\u2019re actually Free People,\u201d Pfeiffer laughs. \u201cI think all the Band Aid denim is, because it\u2019s got great stretch so we can move around on stage easily. And I love my jeans so much. I keep joking I\u2019m gonna steal them when I leave. But I can\u2019t, because that\u2019s not very Penny Lane, you know? She gives way, way more than she takes.\u201d", "label": "human"}

{"text": "As Chicago's immigration crisis continues to escalate, New York City officials now expect state governments to shoulder the bulk of the burden of providing care. According to the city's latest estimates, the cost of caring for and relocating an increasing number of asylum seekers each year is rapidly approaching $100 million. The city of Chicago has been at the forefront of a national migration crisis, with thousands seeking asylum. While some have gained refugee status, many more are living in the middle and struggling to get out of shelters for overcrowded and often neglected homeless people in the city. To cope with this pressure, municipal officials are now seeking an additional $50 million in state funding to help cover housing, food and medical costs for the city's rapidly growing immigrant population. According to the proposed budget, most of the funds will be used to provide health care and housing for those seeking asylum in the city. Mayor Rahm Emanuel said in a statement: \"This demand is driven by the reality of our city's provision of asylum and basic care for migrants. We must do everything we can to ensure that those seeking asylum in Chicago receive the care and support they need and deserve.\" A recent report from the University of Chicago estimated that the city would need at least $173 million in 2021 to provide adequate care for immigrants. The report went on to say that if immigration continues to increase, the costs could easily exceed $200 million. Alderman Joe Moore, representing Chicago's 49th District, said: \"We need to focus not only on the economic costs of caring for migrants, but also ensure that the city provides the necessary resources and support to help these people transition and integrate into their communities. Without assistance, many of them will likely continue to take to the streets in long-term need of assistance.\" Springfield lawmakers have reacted to the city's request for more resources inconsistently. While some, including Gov. JB Pritzker, expressed support for the city's request, others argued that additional funds should be allocated to other areas of the budget. \"We are facing serious challenges and the country needs to strengthen and do its part,\" said Kimberly Lightford, a Senate majority leader who supported the city's demands. \"The state has a responsibility to provide resources to help cities take care of these people and ensure that they can achieve the American dream.\" Meanwhile, Chicagoers are taking action to help migrants in their own unique ways. Groups like the Chicago Immigrant Solidarity Network and the Autonomous Tenant Alliance have organized housing and legal aid for asylum seekers, while grassroots activists are doing everything they can to provide food and basic necessities to those in need. At a time when the city's resources are exhausted, it is more important than ever that we come together to support those in need. We must find a way to bridge the gap between the city's demands for additional funding and the national response so that all Chicago residents, regardless of their country of origin, can get the support they need.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The semiconductor, or chip, industry is perhaps one of the most important and complex sectors in the stock market to understand. Chips are in everything from our smartphones to cars and to all facets of computing, from PCs to massive data centers used for the cloud. Put simply, they are the bricks and mortar of the digital world. We don't see them, but we know they magically make stuff work. Semiconductor companies are also in the news a lot lately, whether it's the U.S. government cracking down on chip exports to China or innovations in connected cars and artificial intelligence. But that doesn't make the industry any easier to understand, even for those familiar with the well-known players. Making things trickier: The market tends to bucket anything chip-related into broad-based investment vehicles, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds. These companies, however, are quite specialized. Despite the industry being out-of-favor right now \u2013 and our ongoing effort to scale back our once over-weighted chip holdings \u2013 we believe that investors' portfolios should have at least some exposure to the industry. For starters, they are crucial to nearly all secular growth trends today and into the future. And trying to time the booms and busts of the cycle is incredibly difficult if not impossible to do consistently. In our portfolio, we have small positions remaining in Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Nvidia (NVDA), Marvell Technology (MRVL) and Qualcomm (QCOM) \u2014 all of which design chips for varying uses. ( We'll get into the specifics later ). Here then is our guide to all things semiconductor. Our goal is to help you better understand where different chip-related companies sit in the supply chain, to differentiate these companies by their end markets, and to gain more insight on how money flows through the industry. After all, one company's capital expenditure is another company's revenue. What is a foundry model? The term foundry is industry jargon, referring to the factory where chips are made. There are four main categories in the supply chain under this model: Capital equipment makers, pure-play foundries or fabs, fabless designers, and integrated device makers. Capital equipment companies \u2014 such as Applied Materials (AMAT), Lam Research (LRCX), ASML Holdings (ASML) and KLA Corporation (KLAC) \u2014 make the machines used in the manufacturing of semiconductors. Pure-play foundries , or fabs, are companies with factories that fabricate (manufacture) chips designed by other firms (some designers have their own factories but we will touch on that below). In these monstrous facilities, you will find the capital equipment made by the capital equipment makers. That alone should provide some insight into the money flow, because when a foundry is being updated or built from scratch, a good deal of that spending is going to go into buying equipment from the capital equipment makers. When you hear commentary on a call from a foundry player about capital expenditure plans, just remember that what you're also hearing is commentary on demand and revenue for capital equipment makers. Players in the foundry space include companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), often referred to as just TSMC, and GlobalFoundries (GFS). Fabless designers generally outsource the chips they draw up to foundries. Again, we can start to see the flow of funds, as strong guidance from a fabless designer means high demand \u2014 and therefore, a need for a greater number of chips. Of course, the more chips a company needs, the greater the order value it will place with a foundry player such as TSMC. Fabless designers include our Club holdings Nvidia, AMD, Marvell Technology and Qualcomm. Since these companies don't need to invest in expensive fabrication facilities, they can run a more agile asset-light business model. They don't have to concern themselves with the need to lay out significant capital in order to ensure their ability to manufacture the most cutting-edge chips. Finally, integrated device companies design and manufacture their own chips in-house, essentially designers with their own foundries. Players in this group include Intel (INTC), Micron Technology (MU), ON Semiconductor (ON) and Texas Instruments (TXN). Semiconductor supply chain Understanding the structure of the semiconductor sector can help to better understand how money flows through the industry \u2014 and therefore, help members leverage earnings and corporate updates to make more informed decisions when investing in the industry. Here are some examples. If we know that capital equipment is used in foundries, what we really know from a financial perspective is that the capital expenditures (capex) made at the foundry level are directly tied to capital equipment maker revenue. So, when TSMC discusses capex on its conference call, it's our jobs as investors to read those comments through to demand for Applied Materials and Lam Research. When Nvidia discusses supply and demand dynamics, it provides insight into what it will need from a TSMC-type foundry or manufacturing facility. If there is an inventory glut, then the last thing Nvidia wants is more chips; that means fewer orders with TSMC and vice versa. Of course, in that same line of thinking, when cloud providers such as Club holdings Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) discuss investments, it means they need chips. These companies' capex is linked to revenue at fabless designers like Nvidia and AMD. We recently saw this dynamic at play when Meta Platforms (META) announced that 2023 capex spending would increase versus 2022 due to data center investments. The news tanked Meta stock due to what Wall Street believes to be undisciplined spending. However, it provided a boost to the semiconductor stocks that would realize Meta's spending as revenue. If you hear the economy is slowing and the cloud providers say they want to \"digest past investments,\" they are really saying that they spent a lot of money recently and are going to pump the breaks on additional investments in cloud capacity. In your head, you need to say, \"OK, cloud providers are slowing spending, which means less demand for Nvidia. If Nvidia is going to see less demand for the next few quarters then it may need to reduce orders from TSMC. And if TSMC is going to receive fewer orders, it may need cut capex \u2014 and as a result, demand for Lam Research's equipment may decline in the near-term.\" Of course, there are a lot of moving parts and timing the flow of funds is incredibly difficult. But that is how one needs to think at a high level. Remaining on the cutting edge requires always looking ahead, and companies must balance spending slowdowns with continued investment in the long term, which is why gauging the stages of the semiconductor investment cycle is so difficult. Nvidia may be seeing a glut of 30-series chips, but the company stills need to work on ramping production of its 40-series chips to be ready once the inventory glut is worked through. TSMC may not be seeing as much demand for 7-nanometer chips, but it needs to be in a position to start producing 5-nanometer and 3-nanometer chips after that. The company can't stop spending entirely. Without going into it too deeply, the smaller the chip size, the more densely packed the transistors. This results in more speed, less power consumption, and less heat, which would also mean less effort/power consumption/cost to control temperature levels. Types of semiconductor chips Just because two companies may be lumped together based on their places within the foundry business model does not mean they should be viewed as peers or even direct competitors. Despite both being fabless designers, Qualcomm, which focuses heavily on connectivity solutions, should not be likened to fellow fabless designer Nvidia, whose main focus is on graphics processing units (GPUs). Here is a high-level overview of the different kinds of chips that should help members better understand some of the terms thrown around when discussing this industry and a jumping-off point for those that want to research more on their own. Memory : The two main categories of memory chips are NAND and DRAM. Both markets are essentially oligopolies \u2014 meaning a few players control the supply. Samsung, Micron and SK Hynix pretty much own the DRAM market. In the NAND market, Samsung and Micron are also big players, in addition to Kioxia (formerly Toshiba), Western Digital (WDC), SK Hynix and Intel. NAND generally refers to a type of flash memory whereas DRAM stands for dynamic random access memory. As you can tell, this industry can get very technical, confusing, and frustrating very fast for those not familiar with the terms. Flash memory (again, think NAND) refers to a type of non-volatile storage medium. Non-volatile simply means that your data won't be lost once the power goes off. The most common use for flash memory that you may have seen the last time you purchased a personal computer is in solid-state drives (SSD), where all the files are stored on your computer. To really simplify things, when you hear NAND or flash memory, just think of the solid-state drive storage on a consumer PC. (Now you might be asking yourself what an SSD is. Basically, it's the storage device that is fast replacing traditional hard disk drives (HDDs) seen in older computers. Whereas HDDs have a spinning disc on which data is written, SSDs have no moving parts, making them faster and more secure \u2014 though you will pay up for that of course. DRAM is what's known as a volatile memory, meaning that it will retain data only so long as there is power. Oftentimes when you hear the term RAM or see memory listed on your PC specs, this is what is being referred to. Unlike flash, which stores data and files over long periods even when the power is off, DRAM is \"working memory\" that is called upon only when needed by a computer processor to perform a given function. The more intense the function, the more DRAM you might need, which is why a computer used for intense video editing or gaming will require more DRAM than one used to simply surf the web and check emails. Microprocessors : The three main processors to know are the central processing unit (CPU), the graphics processing unit (GPU), and the newer data processing unit (DPU). The CPU like those made by Intel and AMD, which essentially have a duopoly \u2014 two players control the supply \u2014 is basically the brains of a computer. It is responsible for retrieving instructions/inputs, decoding those instructions, and sending them along in order to have an operation carried out to deliver the desired result. As Nvidia put in a past blog post , if the CPU is the brain, then the GPU is the soul. GPUs are more specialized than CPUs and are good at taking on many tasks at once. Whereas a CPU will process data sequentially, a GPU will break down a complex problem into many small tasks and perform them at once. This is why we are seeing their prevalence grow in data centers. While the CPU remains essential, adding a GPU allows for an acceleration in data processing. With more data being transmitted, stored, and processed than ever before \u2014 as cloud computing is increasingly adopted and work on deep learning and artificial intelligence advances \u2014 speed is crucial. The GPU is essentially a duopoly owned by Nvidia and AMD. A DPU like those made by Marvell Technology and Nvidia is a newer type of processor that is becoming increasingly relevant as data centers become more complex. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a blog post , \"This is going to represent one of the three major pillars of computing going forward. The CPU is for general-purpose computing, the GPU is for accelerated computing, and the DPU, which moves data around the data center, does data processing.\" Everything else : To be sure, there are many different types of chips that fall outside of the memory or microprocessor classifications. Examples include those used for 5G, WiFi, Bluetooth, radiofrequency chips, near field communication chips (NFC), application-specific integrated circuit chips (ASICs), and so on. These chips are made by companies like Qualcomm, Marvell Technology, Broadcom (AVGO), ON Semiconductor, NXP Semiconductor (NXPI), and others. Rather than a deep dive into each one \u2014 something beyond the scope of this foundry industry analysis \u2014 we simply want to highlight that the term semiconductor applies to a broad array of chips designed for different purposes and exposed to different end markets that each have their own demand drivers. Bottom line When investing in the chip industry, it is crucial to understand a target company's exposure. You don't necessarily need an engineering level of understanding of how the chips work or are designed, but you do need to have an idea of what end market the company sells into and who the customers are. From there, you can begin to study the relevant end markets to better understand demand trends. Remember, at the end of the day, your primary question and the goal of your research is to understand where the money is flowing. That's true for all investments but especially so when it comes to semiconductors. Because they are literally everywhere but almost never seen, it's not as easy as saying, \"Apple is going to sell a lot of iPhones this quarter.\" Chances are nobody will be sitting around the Thanksgiving table talking about how excited they are for the next-generation memory and microprocessors to drop. However, when you do hear about that new gadget everyone can't wait to get their hands on, ask yourself, \"What semiconductors are sitting inside it?\" Despite being a boom/bust industry, sales do tend to increase over the years, and demand throughout the cycle increases thanks to the growing prevalence of semiconductors in our daily lives, with more chips jammed into each device in smaller and smaller form factors. The iPhone, for example, didn't always have light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology, but it does now to support new features and that means another chip packed in the handset. While we do see secular growth on longer timeframes, the industry still suffers from brutal boom and bust dynamics. Supply and demand drives all industries, but the semiconductor industry in particular is incredibly sensitive to it. Chipmakers have significant pricing power when demand outstrips supply, as we've seen in recent years; new cars will literally sit in the lot collecting dust as manufacturers wait for a key chip. But we see that pricing power turn on a dime once supply exceeds demand, leading to less pricing power and inventory gluts that must be addressed before the next cycle can kick off.

{"text": "The news media was generally happy when Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the cryptocurrency trading platform FTX, offered $25 million in financing for blockchain-based virtual assistant Semafor. But now, according to a recent report, Semafor intends to \"take back\" that investment. The news was initially reported by TheBlockCrypto, attributed to \"sources close to the matter.\" According to the report, Semafor executives did not believe that Bankman-Fried's contributions were good for the company. Bankman-Fried was one of the major investors in the Semafor 2018 seed round, which raised $4 million. In the same year, the company raised another $19 million in Series A financing, with Bankman-Fried being one of the main investors. Semafor's virtual assistant is designed to help users work in their daily lives. The assistant uses artificial intelligence and blockchain technology to give users insights and advice on topics such as budgeting, investing, health and fitness. But the company has struggled in recent years, and according to the report, Bankman-Fried's investment does not provide the momentum it seeks. As a result, Semafor executives are reportedly looking for ways to \"repay\" their investments. It is not clear how much money Semafor hopes to recover from Bankman-Fried. The company has yet to comment on the report, nor does banker-Fried respond to a request for comment. Bankman-Fried is a well-respected investor whose investments are often successful. Moreover, one round of financing he invested was successful and helped Semafor raise the funds needed to continue its development. Nevertheless, reports by Semafor executives hoping to \"repay\" Bankman-Fried's investments have sparked speculation in the crypto community. Many pointed out that if the company did try to recover its investment, it could have serious consequences for the industry. If successful investors like Bankman-Fried can't secure their investments, it could prevent other investors from investing in crypto and blockchain-based companies.

REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein\n\nA remaining question for investors: At what pace will the Fed raise rates in future policy meetings after slowing down to 50 basis points in December? The minutes suggested Fed officials will base decisions on future rate hikes on data and the implications for inflation and growth. The committee will make decisions meeting by meeting, according to the minutes.\n\n\"Participants generally observed that a restrictive policy stance would need to be maintained until the incoming data provided confidence that inflation was on a sustained downward path to 2%, which was likely to take some time,\" the minutes said. \"In view of the persistent and unacceptably high level of inflation, several participants commented that historical experience cautioned against prematurely loosening monetary policy.\"\n\nOfficials viewed the job market as very strong, noting an unemployment rate near historically low levels, still strong payroll gains, a high level of job vacancies, and elevated nominal wage growth. Several participants commented that there were tentative signs of labor market imbalances improving, including declines in job openings and quits over the second half of 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nOfficials see a number of uncertainties surrounding the outlook for inflation stemming from factors abroad, such as China\u2019s relaxation of its zero-COVID policies, Russia\u2019s continued war with Ukraine, and effects of monetary policy from other major global central banks.\n\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences.

{"text": "President Vladimir Zelensky of Ukraine and Russian President Vladimir Putin presented different messages of hope in their New Year's speeches, with both sides committing to overcome the challenges facing their respective countries. In his annual New Year's speech on Tuesday, Zelensky called 2020 a difficult year due to the coronavirus pandemic, but said Ukraine had achieved positive results. \"This year, we're able to do things that we think are impossible,\" he said. \"We have shown the world our strength, our determination and our ability to win.\" Zelensky said Ukraine has achieved the highest economic growth rate in Europe, and he vowed to focus on the economy in 2021. \"We will continue to make Ukraine a leader in the region and ensure that every citizen can feel the results of our efforts,\" he said. In his speech, Putin also acknowledged the challenges posed by the pandemic, saying it brought loss and suffering. But he said that Russia had coped with the crisis and was moving towards recovery. \"We will end this year with a positive attitude: the Russian economy will have its first annual growth in three years,\" he said. Putin also boasted of the success of Russia's COVID-19 vaccine, calling it a \"scientific breakthrough.\" He said the vaccine had become \"a symbol of a victorious future\". The two leaders also spoke about the conflict in eastern Ukraine, and Zelensky said his government had taken steps to de-escalate tensions and resolve the conflict. \"The path to peace lies in diplomacy and dialogue,\" he said. However, Putin accused Ukraine of obstructing the peace process and called on Kiev to make concessions. \"Our goal is to end the war and find an acceptable solution for all. We must create conditions that restore economic ties between the parties to the conflict, and facilitate the exchange of prisoners of war,\" he said. These speeches highlighted the sharp differences between the two countries. Zelensky focused on the economy and the path to peace, while Putin emphasized military strength and strength. Zelensky said Ukraine should seek closer ties with the European Union and the United States, while Putin warned against \"foreign interference\". Despite their differences, both presidents have pledged to win in 2021. For Zelensky, the victory lies in prosperity and peace; for Putin, it depends on national strength and technological progress. \"We will face 2021 with determination and optimism, the future belongs to those who can change it. Let's work together to achieve our dreams,\" Zelensky said. Putin expressed this sentiment as well. \"I wish all Russians a happy new year,\" he said. \"Let's use the opportunity of the coming year to achieve our common goals of victory and prosperity.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe term \u201chybrid\u201d is thrown around too loosely in entertainment, but it genuinely applies to \u201cPaul T. Goldman,\u201d a Peacock series from the director of the \u201cBorat\u201d sequel that combines fiction with sort-of reality, scripted with a behind-the-scenes \u201cmaking of\u201d docuseries. Quirky and odd, the show\u2019s main point feels like the fact we\u2019re all the heroes of our story, at least in our own highly subjective eyes.\n\nIt\u2019s honestly hard to know where to begin in describing the program, which, hilariously, makes note of the fact that after years of shooting and pitching the project, its first nibble was from Quibi. Of course, that \u201cquick bites\u201d streaming service quickly folded, allowing Peacock to step into the void. Critics also received five of the six episodes, and how the show ends, based on what precedes it, is a significant question mark.\n\nFor starters, \u201cPaul T. Goldman\u201d isn\u2019t the real name of the central character, who claims that he was fleeced by his second wife, a scam artist who married him for his money and professed to be tending to an elderly relative during her lengthy absences.\n\nGoldman (it gets confusing to call him anything else) became obsessed with unearthing details about the scheme, writing a book and film treatment about the experience. So Woliner shoots those scenes with Goldman as the awkward star of his own movie opposite real actors \u2013 including recognizable players like Dennis Haysbert, Frank Grillo, James Remar and Dee Wallace \u2013 then makes the viewer privy to all the off-screen shenanigans, as Goldman interacts with his confused but polite co-stars, who (understandably) don\u2019t seem to know what to make of him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a regular guy who got caught up in extraordinary circumstances,\u201d he contends during the direct-to-camera interviews, insisting that \u201cNobody could make up\u201d this story. Later, though, Goldman freely admits that parts of his screenplay version have been fabricated or embellished for dramatic effect, further blurring the lines.\n\nJust to complicate matters further, Woliner himself is a regular presence in the film \u2013 fielding his star\u2019s strange requests and suggestions that Goldman thinks will improve things \u2013 while weaving in photos, video and audio of actual characters, sometimes with their faces obscured.\n\nAs the episodes proceed, it becomes clear that Goldman has fudged details about much of what transpired, making it difficult to take what he says at face value.\n\nLike \u201cBorat,\u201d there\u2019s discomfort and comedy in this nexus of fiction and manipulated reality, and the extent to which Goldman appears oblivious to how he might look when all of this gets edited together. Is it cruel to indulge his delusions of grandeur? Given that he appears to be having the time of his life, it\u2019s hard to tell.\n\nProduced by Seth Rogen\u2019s company, \u201cPaul T. Goldman\u201d obviously comes during a boom time for true-crime docuseries, which frequently employ reenactments to heighten the drama. Woliner has essentially taken that practice to bizarre extremes, creating something that manages to feel fresh and occasionally quite funny, if a little cringe inducing at times.\n\nThe net result is a show that\u2019s as oddly watchable as it is hard to define. If only Quibi had lived to see it.\n\n\u201cPaul T. Goldman\u201d premieres January 1 on Peacock.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "According to Freddie Mac, the start of the new year brings promising news for potential homeowners looking to buy a home or seek refinancing existing mortgages: mortgage and refinance rates remain unchanged. According to Freddie Mac's Primary Mortgage Market Survey, the average interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages has remained stable at 2.77%. Meanwhile, there have been no changes for 15-year fixed-rate mortgages at 2.17%. In addition, the average interest rate for 5-year U.S. Treasury Index Mixed Adjusted Rate Mortgages (ARM) rose slightly to 2.63%, up from 2.62% the previous week. This is even better news for those who want to buy or refinance, as the Federal Reserve continues to support the housing market at low rates. Low mortgage rates can make buying a home more affordable, and those who want to refinance may benefit from lower monthly payments. But potential borrowers should move quickly, as some experts warn that interest rates may begin to rise in the coming weeks. \"The interest rates are still very favorable, especially for fixed-rate loans, and I expect the demand for buying and refinancing will increase in the coming weeks,\" said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist, in a statement. \"This may be the last call by potential borrowers to lock down low rates ahead of an upward trend.\" This encouraging news comes after a strong year in the housing market. According to the National Association of Realtors, home sales rebounded sharply for the rest of the year after prices fell in April. According to the latest data from S&P Dow Jones Indices, the Case-Shiller Home Price Index, which measures U.S. home prices, rose 2.5 percent in November from a year earlier. Nevertheless, potential home buyers should not feel pressure to buy or refinance before they are ready. They should consider taking the time to organize their credit scores, budget and save healthy down payments, and compare rates and terms between multiple lenders to ensure they get the best deal possible. If you want to refinance, it's important to make calculations before signing a point line to ensure that it makes financial sense. Refinancing may reduce your monthly payments and release cash, but it will also increase the total interest you pay during the loan period. If you're ready to take action, today's interest rate is a good opportunity to lock down low rates. But be sure to do your homework first to make sure you find the situation that works best for you.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The newly elected U.S. Representative of California, Mark Takano, will be sworn in on January 3 to become the first openly gay member of the U.S. House of Representatives. Takano, a Democrat from Riverside, will break down barriers in Congress and make history as the agency's first openly gay member. As a unique demonstration of his commitment to the Constitution, Takano will be sworn in to use copies of the Constitution and classic Superman comic book. The comic was selected in part to commemorate Takano's hero, Congressman John Lewis, who said in an interview last year: \"I have read Superman since I was a child and I am still reading it.\" \"As the first openly gay member of the House, I am deeply honored to make history,\" Takano said in a statement. \"I will take the oath of office with a deep sense of duty and responsibility towards the people I represent and toward the Constitution of the United States.\" For more than two centuries, the Constitution has been the foundation of our democracy, and I humbly swear,\" Takano continued. \"The Superman comic book is a symbol of courage and justice, and it is in this spirit that I will serve the people of California's 41st Congressional District.\" The first was Barney Frank, who served from 1981 to 2013. Takano's oath of office marked an important milestone in the progress of American civil rights. The elected member of Congress grew up in Riverside, attended Lasserra High School and then went to Harvard University for a bachelor's degree in biology. Then he earned a master's degree in public policy at the University of California, Riverside, and eventually returned to Leverside to teach at Lasserra High School. Takano spent 24 years in politics before being elected to the House of Representatives. He was first elected as a member of the Riverside County Board of Education in 1990 and served on the board for eight years. After that, he served four years on the Riversside Community College District Board of Trustees, followed by 12 years at the Riverside City Council. Takano has long been an advocate of civil rights. During his tenure in the Riverside City Council, he successfully pushed for the passage of a \"special non-discrimination\" decree that aims to prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation. In his campaign, Takano spoke about the importance of education and said he wanted to focus on creating jobs, maintaining Social Security and Medicare, and strengthening the economy. He also supported the DREAM Act, which would provide access to citizenship for young people who entered the United States illegally. The inauguration of Targno's elected MP is an important moment not only for the LBGT community, but also for all those who believe in equality and justice. As Targino himself has said, he will serve \"in the spirit of courage and justice,\" a cause that we should all be proud to support.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "In what some have described as a shocking turn of events, former President Donald Trump has revealed that he believes Kevin McCarthy's failure to become Speaker of the House for six consecutive times is good news. The long struggle to replace House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been widely seen as a two-horse race between McCarthy and Democrat Steny Hoyer. In the record sixth round of voting on January 3, Hoyer was eventually elected speaker, but McCarthy has been a favorite for bookstores to win positions. Trump expressed his views in an interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News, who asked him if the Republicans' failure in his pursuit was a \"disappointment.\" \"I think it's great because it shows that the Democrats are really in chaos. It shows that they don't really control the House, and it shows their weakness.\" \"So I think it's a good thing, and I think Republicans should use it to their advantage.\" Trump's remarks have caused some turmoil among Republicans. While some people think he is right to see McCarthy's defeat as an opportunity for the party, others are less sympathetic. \"It's undeniable that McCarthy's inability to get elected is an embarrassment for Republicans,\" said one senior Republican who declined to be named. \"This is a huge moment for Republicans and a great opportunity to prove they are a credible force in the House, which makes it difficult for McCarthy's failure to get elected.\" \"While I understand President Trump's point of view, I think his remarks indicate a lack of empathy and understanding of the situation,\" the Republican added. McCarthy himself declined to comment on Trump's remarks, but a source close to him called the former president's comments \"unhelpful.\" \"Kevin was very hard to get elected, and he's obviously disappointed,\" the source said, adding: \"This has been a difficult time for him and his team, and it doesn't help to hear President Trump make such comments.\" While some Republicans disagree with McCarthy's plight, others argue that the party must unite around him and do everything it can to ensure his success in the next round of voting. His success may depend on how Republicans react to Trump's remarks. If they can move beyond the incident and rally behind McCarthy, his chances of becoming Speaker will certainly increase.", "label": "machine"}

On Dec. 28, the Illinois Emergency Management Agency and the Illinois Department of Human Resources notified the city they have \u201cexhausted all available fiscal resources for the operation of the asylum seeker mission,\u201d and given \u201cthe state is at a critical juncture with its operations and finances\u201d cannot support the city\u2019s ongoing costs beyond Jan. 31.\n\nEditorial Editorial\n\nSince the summer, the city and state have provided shelter and other services to about 3,700 migrants, with the state spending over $120 million.

{"text": "Cryptocurrency lender Genesis Global Capital has laid off nearly 30 percent of its workforce, a source close to the company told Reuters on Tuesday. The layoffs are the latest sign of challenges facing the crypto lending industry, which has been hit by a bear market since late 2018. Genesis, supported by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, launched in 2018 and has rapidly grown to become one of the industry's leading lending institutions. But the company has been hit hard by a decline in the crypto market and has been reducing its workforce over the past few months. Sources said the cuts involved all sectors, including risk, operations and marketing. Genesis did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The crypto lending industry has seen its wealth decline since the end of 2018, when the cryptocurrency market fell from an all-time high. The collapse of the crypto market has put pressure on the industry, and lenders have been forced to scale back operations and lay off staff. Competitors such as Catia Network, BlockFi and SALT Lending have laid off employees in recent months. Genesis' job cuts come as the company faces fierce competition from other lenders and increased regulatory scrutiny. In recent months, the company has seen rivals like BlockFi and Caesium Network expand their offerings and engage in active marketing campaigns. Competition has already lowered the interest rate on crypto loans, and regulators have been keeping a close eye on the sector, putting further pressure on the industry. Genesis is one of the largest lenders in the crypto space and has been supported by some of the industry's biggest investors, including Andreessen Horowitz and the Digital Currency Group. The company had a record total of $1.2 billion in loans in 2018 and plans to increase it this year. But recent market downturns and competition have created resistance to these plans. It's unclear whether Genesis will be able to weather the current storm, but layoffs suggest it is tightening its belt and trying to cut costs to get through a downturn.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "It's no secret that the sooner you start saving and investing, the better it will be when you retire. However, for people in their 20s, investing for retirement seems daunting, overwhelming, not a priority. But it's important to start investing and saving in your 20s - the perfect time to build a retirement savings plan and lay the groundwork for a strong financial future. That's why you should start thinking about investing and saving now: Your money will have more time to grow. Early investments can give your money more time to grow. This is especially true when it comes to investing in stocks, bonds and mutual funds, all of which have the potential to generate significant returns if given enough time. Composite interest is an important tool for any retirement savings plan. Interest rates are usually low in the early days of your investment, but the longer you allow money to grow, the more money you will have in the long run. Start with low-risk, low-cost options When investing in your 20s, you don't need to make big commitments. Start small with low-risk, low-cost options such as index funds or ETFs. These investment tools allow you to have a larger portfolio and provide low-risk choices with high return potential. 3. Enjoyment of tax benefits Donations to certain retirement accounts, such as IRA or 401(k)s, are usually tax-free. This means that the money you donate is not subject to income tax, so you can save more for your retirement. 4.Invest in yourself Investing in people in their 20s doesn't have to be limited to stocks, bonds and other retirement savings plans; it's also important to consider investing in yourself. This can include further education, starting a business or even investing in career development. By spending time investing in yourself, you will gain the necessary skills and knowledge to advance your career and increase your earning potential.Investing in yourself will provide a significant return in the future. Have more control over your money. Investing in your 20s is also a good way to better control your money. Investing can give you more freedom to choose where to put your money, rather than relying on financial institutions or employer-sponsored retirement plans. This will give you more freedom to make the investment that best suits your financial goals. Early investing gives you the opportunity to start building retirement savings and taking advantage of tax incentives, which is also the best time to invest in yourself to boost your career and earning income potential. Taking the time to invest and save in your 20s will pay off in the long run.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".. On Sunday, the tech community was shocked that a Twitter angel investor appeared to laugh at Elon Musk, proposing to buy the company and threatening to withdraw his investment if Musk said no. The strange event began when an angel investor, who was referred to as \"Robert Miller,\" sent a tweet to Musk saying he was considering buying Twitter and that he would cut sales if Musk were willing to help facilitate the acquisition. \"Hey, Elon, I want to buy Twitter, and if you can help me, I'd like to give you a little bit of sales. What about 10%?\" he wrote on Twitter. The tweet spread quickly because Musk is one of Twitter's most popular people, with more than 51 million followers. But it didn't stop there. Miller followed another tweet saying that if Musk refused to help facilitate the acquisition, he would withdraw his investment from the company. \"If you say no, I'll take all of my investments back from Twitter. Trust me, I'm not a small investor,\" Miller wrote. The tweet quickly sparked a heated debate on Twitter about whether Miller's proposal was serious or just a joke. Some thought it was only an attempt to draw attention, while others saw it as a legitimate offer and that Miller had enough money to support his proposal. The incident quickly caught the attention of the tech community and became a hot topic on Twitter. Many technology and media commentators also weighed the situation, arguing whether Miller's proposal was serious or not, and questioning why he proposed it. At the same time, Musk has yet to respond to Miller's proposal. It is unclear whether he will accept or condemn it. But one thing is certain: the tech community will be watching closely for what happens next. In the past, Miller has criticized Musk's business decisions and questioned the wisdom of some of his investments. For example, Miller recently criticized Musk's decision to invest in The Boring Company as a waste of money. Ultimately, it remains to be seen whether Miller's proposal to buy Twitter is serious or just an attempt to draw attention. But one thing is clear: the tech community will keep a close eye on what happens next.", "label": "machine"}

A ella le dijeron que su hijo hab\u00eda fallecido luego del parto, pero a\u00f1os m\u00e1s tarde comprob\u00f3, por un testimonio familiar, que estaba vivo.\n\nLa Comisi\u00f3n Nacional por el Derecho a la Identidad (Conadi), creada en 1992 a instancias de Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo para la b\u00fasqueda de sus nietos sustra\u00eddos durante la \u00faltima dictadura militar (1976-1983), lanz\u00f3 la campa\u00f1a \u201cMam\u00e1s que buscan\u201d que ampl\u00eda su labor: ahora tambi\u00e9n convoca a quienes buscan a sus familiares y cuyos casos no est\u00e1n relacionados con ese r\u00e9gimen para ayudarlos a restituir su identidad.\n\n\u201cNosotros fuimos viendo que el robo y tr\u00e1fico de ni\u00f1os, la venta, el despojo, como se le quiera llamar, de los hijos de desaparecidos, como de los hijos de mujeres pobres, solas y menores de edad, transitaban carriles muy similares\u201d, explica Claudia Carlotto, directora ejecutiva de la Conadi. \u201cLogramos, por fin, un equipo, estructura, recursos y que se haga una campa\u00f1a como la que estamos llevando adelante ahora para convocar a la sociedad a que cualquier mam\u00e1 que haya sido alejada o separada de su hijo al nacer o al poco tiempo de vida, se pueda acercar a nosotros para acompa\u00f1arla y poner al servicio de estas realidades toda la experiencia de estos 30 a\u00f1os de trabajo por el derecho a la identidad de la Conadi\u201d.\n\npublicidad\n\nAs\u00ed comienzan a sistematizar una labor que hasta ahora muchas veces era el resultado de otras b\u00fasquedas: en el camino de encontrar a los nietos robados durante la dictadura, lograron restituir la identidad de m\u00e1s de 2.000 personas que no eran hijos de desaparecidos, seg\u00fan afirman.\n\nMam\u00e1s e hijos que buscan\n\nJudith Alexandre sent\u00eda que quien dec\u00eda ser su madre no era tal. Con el tiempo logr\u00f3 deducir que era adoptada y comenz\u00f3 a buscar sus verdaderos or\u00edgenes. \u201cEs una b\u00fasqueda muy larga que me acompa\u00f1\u00f3 toda la vida, porque desde muy chiquita sent\u00ed que algo hab\u00eda. Mi mam\u00e1 ten\u00eda 44 a\u00f1os cuando yo nac\u00ed y mi pap\u00e1 nueve m\u00e1s, 53. Hac\u00eda diez que estaban casados, estaban en lista de adopci\u00f3n legal, en lista de espera y pensaban que no les iban a dar un beb\u00e9 por la edad que ten\u00edan. Y de alguna forma alguien les hizo el contacto, les dijo \u2018ac\u00e1 ten\u00e9s la posibilidad de un beb\u00e9 reci\u00e9n nacido\u2019, tuvieron que poner plata, pero lo ten\u00e9s con papeles y todo y ya est\u00e1. Y as\u00ed fue que alguna vez me compraron y llegaron a m\u00ed\u201d.\n\nComo hab\u00eda nacido en 1977, Judith crey\u00f3 que podr\u00eda ser hija de desaparecidos. Por eso, en 1997 hab\u00eda dejado su sangre en el Banco Nacional de Datos Gen\u00e9ticos, que recopila la informaci\u00f3n de los familiares de desaparecidos.\n\nPero no tuvo resultados, su caso no ten\u00eda que ver con los secuestros de la dictadura. Y su mam\u00e1 biol\u00f3gica estaba viva. A\u00f1os m\u00e1s tarde supo que la buscaba.\n\n\u201cYa hac\u00eda m\u00e1s de 20 a\u00f1os\u2026 con lo cual mi expectativa de que ese llamado ocurra, so\u00f1ado, en la primera d\u00e9cada de \u2018te llamamos para decirte que encontramos\u2019 ya era muy remoto, era casi imposible. Ya hab\u00eda descartado esa expectativa\u201d, explica Judith, pero agrega, entre risas: \u201cY bueno, me llaman de la Conadi: Encontramos a tu mam\u00e1 y a tu hermana, me dice. As\u00ed como lo dijo, yo ya empec\u00e9 a no entender m\u00e1s nada del mundo\u201d.\n\nJudith, que para ese entonces ya ten\u00eda cuatro hijos, supo que no solo ten\u00eda una mam\u00e1, si no tambi\u00e9n dos hermanas. Todos se conocieron inmediatamente en las oficinas de la Conadi al d\u00eda siguiente de ese llamado.\n\n\u201cFue muy fuerte el abrazo de mam\u00e1 hacia m\u00ed. Me miraba y me acariciaba las manos, como miramos las mam\u00e1s a los reci\u00e9n nacidos. Eso fue muy, muy fuerte\u201d, recuerda emocionada mientras muestra fotos con su mam\u00e1 Adriana. El parecido f\u00edsico de ambas es notable y de car\u00e1cter, apunta Judith, tambi\u00e9n.\n\n\u201cCuando mi mam\u00e1 habl\u00f3 conmigo me dec\u00eda \u2018hija, vos preguntame todo lo que quieras saber\u2019, que eso era lo opuesto a lo que yo hab\u00eda vivido hasta ah\u00ed. Era \u2018no me preguntes\u2019, \u2018\u00bfqu\u00e9 te falta, que te hice?\u2019. Y desde ah\u00ed empieza otro cap\u00edtulo, mi vida se transforma. Mi mam\u00e1 de crianza hab\u00eda fallecido meses antes, en noviembre y en agosto nos reencontramos: yo no pas\u00e9 ning\u00fan D\u00eda de la Madre sin madre (N. de R: en Argentina se celebra en octubre). Es muy loco, muy fuerte y muy lindo porque siempre quise encontrarla\u201d\n\nLas madres, el eje de la campa\u00f1a\n\nLa campa\u00f1a de Conadi est\u00e1 enfocada principalmente en estas \u201cMam\u00e1s que buscan\u201d principalmente porque la desproporci\u00f3n es enorme: tienen m\u00e1s de 15.000 hijos buscando sus or\u00edgenes, pero solo 500 madres tratando de encontrarlos.\n\n\u201cEl patr\u00f3n es joven, pobre, sola. Sin contenci\u00f3n de ninguna naturaleza social, ni familiar ni econ\u00f3mica, que no pueda reclamar, que tenga miedo, que no tenga posibilidades de recurrir a un abogado\u201d, explica Carlotto. Adem\u00e1s, agrega, muchas veces hay sentimientos de culpa por haber dejado a sus hijos, aunque hayan sido forzadas a hacerlo.\n\n\u201cYo habr\u00e9 cometido el error de enamorarme y quedar embarazada, pero yo no quer\u00eda que me quitaran mi beb\u00e9\u201d, sostiene M\u00f3nica, a quien su familia intent\u00f3 separarla de su novio y sacarle su hijo. \u201cMe dijeron \u2018\u00e9l no te quiere. \u00c9l no te busca, no te llama y nosotros no vamos a poder criar ese beb\u00e9. Es una verg\u00fcenza para nosotros que hayas quedado embarazada\u2019\u201d, relata.\n\n\u201cHab\u00eda clientes que hab\u00edan pedido un producto y una red delictiva, en la cual el Estado, por acci\u00f3n u omisi\u00f3n es part\u00edcipe necesario, dedicada a robar beb\u00e9s a pedido y traficar con ellos, \u00bfno?\u201d, sostiene Ester.\n\nA Ester le dijeron que su hijo hab\u00eda nacido muerto, pero nunca le entregaron ning\u00fan certificado y los m\u00e9dicos adujeron que el cuerpo hab\u00eda sido cremado. 37 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, luego de ver en televisi\u00f3n testimonios de madres que hab\u00edan pasado por su misma situaci\u00f3n, volvi\u00f3 a la cl\u00ednica para intentar, nuevamente, corroborar que su hijo hab\u00eda nacido muerto, pero all\u00ed se encontr\u00f3 con documentos plagados de irregularidades. Fue entonces que comenz\u00f3 su b\u00fasqueda.\n\n\u201cEn el caso de estas nuevas situaciones hay que tratar de obtener la mayor informaci\u00f3n posible de cada uno de los casos y cruzarlos en una base de datos que es compleja y sofisticada porque tienen que dar un \u201cmatch\u201d para despu\u00e9s realizar entre esas coincidencias de esa persona que busca y esa mam\u00e1 que reclama tambi\u00e9n un an\u00e1lisis gen\u00e9tico 1 a 1, para ver si finalmente se encontraron o no\u201d, explica Carlotto.\n\nEse trabajo, sostiene, lleva mucho tiempo y es muy dif\u00edcil, sobre todo porque se trabaja sobre pactos de silencio y muchas mentiras.\n\nSin embargo, a diferencia de la b\u00fasqueda de los nietos de desparecidos, estos casos tienen una ventaja: se puede resolver con un an\u00e1lisis de ADN mitocondrial 1 a 1 de la madre y el hijo.\n\n\u201cEn esta situaci\u00f3n la generaci\u00f3n de las madres est\u00e1. El \u00edndice de abuelidad requiere de una enorme cantidad de familiares. Hay familias que, por no estar los padres y porque alg\u00fan abuelo hab\u00eda fallecido, necesitaron entre 15 y 20 personas para reconstruir al desaparecido. Una reconstrucci\u00f3n mucho m\u00e1s compleja\u201d, explica Carlotto.\n\n\u201cEs muy fuerte el verme reflejada en mi mam\u00e1, que con mi madre de crianza estaba todo bien. Yo la amaba, no es que no quisiera, pero hay algo del reflejo del famoso espejo con ella que me pas\u00f3 desde la oficina de la Conadi, que con mi otra mam\u00e1 nunca lo hab\u00eda podido vivir. Y s\u00ed lo he visto en mis hijos\u201d, relata Judith, para quien, a pesar de una espera de m\u00e1s de 30 a\u00f1os, la historia tuvo un final feliz.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "One of the most pressing questions facing the tech industry in 2023 is whether it will be able to stay alive amid economic uncertainty. While economists and analysts agree that the economy is heading toward a recession, Amazon's confident economists are more optimistic about the outlook for the coming year. Alexander Zaretsky, chief economist at the e-commerce giant, said Amazon's confidence in its economic outlook was supported by several key factors. First, he emphasized the resilience of the tech industry, which has weathered years of challenges and is now entering its fourth consecutive year of growth. \"Despite all the ups and downs of the tech industry, it has always shown its ability to quickly rebound and innovate. This is especially true for Amazon, which continues to break records and expand its business globally,\" Zaretsky said. In addition to the overall strength and resilience of the tech industry, Zaretsky mentioned Amazon's extensive investment in research and development.Amazon invests heavily in research and development, which allows the company to stay at the forefront of technology, thus improving its competitive advantage. \"R&D is a key driver of economic growth, and Amazon's investment in R&D has enabled the company to stay ahead of the curve by providing customers with the latest and best technology and services. This innovation has been a key driver of Amazon's success and will allow us to continue growing over the coming year,\" Zaretsky commented. He also highlighted Amazon's impressive record in creating jobs and providing economic opportunities. According to Zaretsky, over the past five years, Amazon has added more than 1 million new jobs, while its investments in infrastructure, technology and training have generated additional income for more than 2 million people around the world. \"These jobs and opportunities, combined with Amazon's extensive investment in physical and digital infrastructure, allow us to create a vibrant ecosystem of economic opportunity that benefits countries and communities around the world,\" Zaretsky said. Finally, Zaretsky emphasized Amazon's commitment to customers, which he believed would help the company remain competitive in the long run. Amazon has been focused on improving customer experience, which in turn helped the company maintain its growth rate. \"The key to Amazon's success is our commitment to our customers. We are constantly innovating to improve the customer experience and provide the best possible service, allowing customers to come back to us again and again. We believe that this focus on customer satisfaction will help us continue to perform well in the coming year,\" said Zaretsky. Amazon's confident outlook for the coming year has been questioned by some analysts, who are less optimistic about its economic prospects in 2023. However, Amazon's chief economist stressed that investments in research and development, job creation, and customer satisfaction will help it remain competitive regardless of the economic environment.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "As the November election draws near, the next House Speaker's race is booming. After a lengthy and sometimes controversial campaign to become the top Republican in the House, House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) becomes the forward. On Tuesday, Rep. George Santos (R-FL) announced his decision to vote for McCarthy in the first round of the House speaker's vote, saying: \"I am pleased to announce that I support leader McCarthy as the next speaker.\" Rep. Santos' vote on McCarthy adds to the broad support California Republicans have already received from the House Republican Caucus. While McCarthy has been running for the next speaker since early 2019, recently McCarthy won public support from Mike Johnson (R-LA), chairman of the Republican Research Committee, and Steve Scallis (R-LA), a minority whip in the House. \"As I traveled across the country and talked to members of the Republican Caucus, one thing I heard was very clear: Kevin McCarthy is the right leader for our party now,\" Rep. Santos said in a statement. McCarthy, who is currently the minority leader in the House of Representatives, has been popular among Republicans in the House because of his successful campaign to raise awareness about Congress and his ability to lead and unify the party. His messages have focused on the economy and jobs as well as immigration reform. McCarthy said in a statement after Santos' announcement: \"I am honored to have the support of my friend and colleague George Santos, whose vote of confidence further reinforces our growing support from our Republican colleagues. \"As we continue to consolidate the majority's success, I am confident that House Republicans will remain united and committed to our common goal of getting things done for the American people,\" McCarthy said. President Donald Trump, who supported McCarthy's campaign for president, praised him on Twitter earlier this month: \"Kevin has done an excellent job as the minority leader in the House of Representatives and will be a great leader for the Speaker of the House. He has my full and complete support!\" One of McCarthy's main challenges is winning members of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, which could become an important group if McCarthy's campaign for president succeeds. Nonetheless, it appears that McCarthy has made significant progress in securing the votes needed for the first round of voting. Santos, who is not a member of the House Freedom Caucus, said: \"I am confident that McCarthy leaders will be able to unite our party and bring the Caucus together in order to achieve the goals we have all been elected to: a thriving economy, secure borders, and a strong America at home and abroad.\" McCarthy needs 218 votes to be elected as Speaker, and the election will take place on January 3, 2019 in the new 116th Congress. With Santos' vote, McCarthy's campaign for President of the House appears to be in good shape.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Ashleigh Barty, the world's number one tennis champion, announced that she will guide 19-year-old Australian Priscilla Gardgi to the upcoming Australian Open. The partnership marks the first time a Grand Slam champion has ever guided a wild card player to a major tournament. The initiative was established in 2020 by former world number one Andy Murray and is run in partnership with the Women's Tennis Association. \"I am delighted to be part of the Murray-WTA mentor program and help Priscilla achieve her goals at the Australian Open. She is a talented player with a bright future ahead, and I am pleased that she has qualified for foreign cards. This program is an excellent opportunity for young players to gain championship guidance and access to the best coaches and expertise in the world. I look forward to helping Priscilla realize her full potential.\" \"I am very humble and excited to have the opportunity to be guided by world No. 1 Ashley Barty, who has always been my role model, and I appreciate her guidance. Being able to train with the best people in the world and get advice from someone like Ash is a dream come true, and I look forward to the success of the Australian Open.\" The Murray-WTA Mentor Program was created by Andy Murray to provide young and upcoming players with resources, support and guidance from experienced professionals. In addition to Barty and Gardji, the program also includes a range of well-known players and coaches from the women's tour, including Serena Williams, Caroline Wozniacki, Simone Halep and Billy Jean King. The program works by assigning players to mentors and pairing them with coaches who can provide specific guidance and advice.The program provides access to training facilities, professional fitness trainers and nutritionists, as well as pre-match preparation and post-match analysis and advice. The goal of the Murray-WTA coaching program is to help young and upcoming players transition from junior tour to professional level. Hopefully, by pairing them with experienced successful players and coaches, they can learn the necessary skills to succeed on a professional tour. In addition to the Australian Open, the Murray-WTA coaching program will also introduce a series of events to help young players transition to professional tours. These tournaments will be held in Europe, Asia and the United States, giving young players the opportunity to participate in competitions and show their talents. \"The Murray-World Table Tennis League coaching program is a great way to help young players transition to the professional tour. By pairing players with experienced, successful players and coaches, they can learn the skills necessary to succeed and compete at the highest level. I am proud to be part of this program and to help young players transition to professional tennis.\" The Australian Open will begin in a few weeks, and the founders of the program believe Barty's guidance to Gardgi will give her the skills and confidence she needs to compete. It is not clear whether Cardgie can use this opportunity to build a reputation for herself in tennis, but with Barty's guidance, she certainly has a good chance. The Murray-WTA coaching program is an important step in the development of young players, and Barty's participation proves the success of the program.It is hoped that Gardgi will take full advantage of this opportunity and successfully transition to a professional level.", "label": "machine"}

For example, value sales of mince pies soared by 19% but volume purchases barely increased at all,\" said Fraser McKevitt, Kantar's head of retail and consumer insight.\n\nKantar said grocery price inflation was 14.4% in December, down from 14.6% in November, with prices rising fastest in markets such as milk, dog food and frozen potato products.\n\n\"This is the second month in a row that grocery price inflation has fallen, raising hopes that the worst has now passed,\" McKevitt said.\n\nSeparate data published on Wednesday by the British Retail Consortium showed fresh food prices at UK supermarkets in early December were 15.0% higher than a year earlier, the biggest annual increase since at least 2005 when records started.\n\nKantar noted that consumers continued to trade down to supermarkets\u2019 own label products, with sales rising by 13.3%, well ahead of a 4.7% increase in branded lines.\n\nIt said visits to supermarkets increased 5.2% year-on-year.

And they might be just what you need to get your professional groove back on track.\n\nWe scoured Insider's trove of content for the best tips, tricks, and strategies to rev up your motivation at work in 2023. Here they are.\n\nPrepare for challenges\n\nAnticipating how you'll deal with inevitable obstacles on your way to achieving a goal is critical.\n\nGabriele Oettingen, a psychology professor at New York University and the University of Hamburg, calls it \"WOOPing.\" WOOP stands for Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan.\n\nOettingen, the author of the book \"Rethinking Positive Thinking: Inside the New Science of Motivation,\" explained the process in a New York Times opinion column: \"Think of a wish. For a few minutes, imagine the wish coming true, letting your mind wander and drift where it will. Then shift gears. Spend a few more minutes imagining the obstacles that stand in the way of realizing your wish.\"\n\nIf you're planning to petition your boss for a promotion, for example, imagine some of the questions your manager might ask about your qualifications \u2014 and how you might answer them.\n\nIt's a \"hybrid approach that combines positive thinking with 'realism,'\" Oettingen wrote.\n\nGive people advice\n\nOne way to get yourself out of a slump is to give advice to others struggling with similar problems. It might sound strange to give advice on things you don't feel you've fully mastered, but research shows it orients you toward action and gives you a shot of confidence.\n\nIn one study, Ayelet Fishbach, a professor of behavioral science at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business, asked middle-school students to either give motivational advice to younger students or receive motivational advice from teachers. She found that the advice-givers spent more time on homework over the following month than those who received advice.\n\nShe replicated this phenomenon across a number of different domains: Struggling people who gave advice were more motivated to save money, control their tempers, lose weight, and look for a new job.\n\n\"Your first reaction might be, 'Why would you ask me?'\" Fishbach, the author of \"Get It Done: Surprising Lessons From the Science of Motivation,\" told Insider.\n\n\"But once you search your memory to figure out what you've learned \u2014 or not learned \u2014 about how to accomplish a goal, it reminds you of how much you already know.\"\n\nSet just one priority every day\n\nBe honest about how much you can do.\n\nOn any given day, there are likely dozens of to-dos vying for your attention. Trying to attend to them all is typically a way to ensure you attend to none of them.\n\nIn their book, \"Make Time: How to Focus on What Matters Every Day,\" Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky advise starting each day by identifying a \"highlight,\" or the most important thing you'd like to accomplish in the next 24 hours. Knapp and Zeratsky helped set up the design-sprint process at Google, so they know a thing or two about time management. Maybe it's revising a complex budget spreadsheet; maybe it's making the final calls necessary to close a sale.\n\n\"Consider what's most meaningful to you, not what is most urgent,\" the authors wrote. And \"think about what needs the most effort or work.\"\n\nThe idea is to be realistic about your bandwidth and to minimize distractions from the relationships and projects that are most important to you right now.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "As we approach the new year with hope and determination, many of us are turning to the same annual ritual: setting goals, making New Year's resolutions, defining our way forward. How do you turn your New Year's resolutions into reality? To help answer this question, we've gathered some scientifically supported suggestions that can help you stick to your goals. First, take a moment to reflect on the past year. Ask yourself: What experiences and lessons have I learned? Where have I stumbled? What do I want to repeat or do this year? By reflecting on the lessons of the past year, you can focus your decisions on areas that can truly change your life. Second, set realistic, measurable goals. You may have ambitious goals, such as achieving a healthier lifestyle or finding work. However, instead of planning to do something big, break your goals down into smaller, actionable steps. Instead of \"healthier\" vague goals, try setting more specific goals such as \"exercise 20 minutes three times a week\" or \"eat more fruits and vegetables.\" It's important to set measurable goals and track your progress, but it's also important to focus on the process of achieving them, not just the end result. For example, if your determination is to run a marathon, try to focus on putting in the hard work and effort to achieve this goal, rather than simply crossing the finish line. Fourth, keep a journal. Writing down your resolutions and keeping track of your progress can help you stay responsible and motivated. It can also help you reflect on your journey and let you know about any obstacles you may encounter. If you notice that you are working towards a goal, you can adjust it to make it more attainable. Fifth, reward your progress. Setting goals is a long and often difficult process, so rewarding yourself for small victories along the way can help you stay motivated and remind you of the progress you've made. It can be anything from snacks to a day's rest. Any reward for your hard work will do. Finally, don't forget to be gentle with yourself. Your goals are important, but so is your mental and physical health. If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed or frustrated, take a step back and remember to be kind to yourself.It's okay to take a break, adjust your goals, or seek help. 2020 is a challenging year, but by making realistic and attainable New Year resolutions, you can make 2021 the year of growth and progress.

{"text": ".. It looks like Avatar 2 will have a wonderful journey. After months of waiting, James Cameron's Avatar 2 will be the highest-selling film in 2022, surpassing Top Gun: Maverick for the top ranking. Avatar 2, a sequel to Cameron's 2009 hit on Avatar, has broken the highest-earning film record of 2022 and is becoming the 10th biggest movie ever. According to the data provided by Box Office Mojo, Avatar 2 has reached $1.5 billion in the United States and Canada alone, with an estimated global total revenue of about $3.5 billion. The highly anticipated sequel, released in December last year, was a huge success among fans. The film received critical acclaim and has been praised for its visual effects, pioneering 3D and moving stories. The story of Avatar 2 takes place in the distant future and tells the story of former Marine Jake Sully who finds himself in an alien world. Along the way, he discovers a powerful new force called Pandora and a group of brave fighters named Navi. Avatar 2 has already broken many box office records. It is the first film to earn more than $1 billion in U.S. box office history, and the world's highest-selling film after Avatar, with a total revenue of $2.8 billion in 2009. The film also managed to outperform Marvel's Black Panther, which had a total revenue of $1.3 billion in 2018, and Star Wars: The Last Jedi, which had a total revenue of $1.3 billion in 2017. The success of Avatar 2 is particularly impressive, as it was released during the Coronavirus pandemic. With theaters closed in many countries, films are difficult to release in theaters. However, thanks to its pioneering visual effects and innovative 3D technology, Avatar 2 is still able to make an impact. In addition to the impressive box office performance, Avatar 2 has won many awards. The film received an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and a BAFTA Award for Best Visual Effects, and is the first movie ever to win both Critics' Choice and Golden Globe Awards for Best Action. The film industry has been dealing with the economic consequences of the epidemic. With the success of Avatar 2, it is clear that audiences still have a strong interest in quality films and that despite the difficulties, the industry can still thrive. The future of Avatar 2 looks bright. With its impressive box office performance, as well as its criticism and audience praise, it will surely be remembered as one of the biggest movies ever made.", "label": "machine"}

Happy to win the division; it\u2019s always tough to do it. NFL games are tough to win and we always figure out a way to keep them somehow exciting. I wish they wouldn\u2019t be as exciting as we made it, but I\u2019m happy we got the win and happy so many guys contributed.\u201d\n\nAll three of Brady\u2019s touchdowns were thrown to wide receiver Mike Evans, who enjoyed a career afternoon in the Week 17 clash.\n\nEvans caught 10 passes for 207 yards and the trio of touchdown passes. Not only did the monster afternoon extend his streak of consecutive seasons with 1,000 receiving yards to nine, becoming the first NFL player to open his career with such a streak, Evans also became the first Bucs player to record 200 or more receiving yards and three scores in a single game.\n\nEvans catches a pass past Keith Taylor Jr. of the Carolina Panthers to score a touchdown. Kevin Sabitus/Getty Images\n\nThe pair had connected for 26 touchdowns in their previous two seasons, but only for three in the previous 16 weeks of the 2022 season.\n\nBut after weeks of struggles and looking off-kilter, Brady and Evans dissected a Panthers defense just when it mattered.\n\n\u201cIt feels great,\u201d said Evans. \u201cIt\u2019s been an up-and-down year. We just kept fighting and we played our best ball today and it was much needed.\u201d\n\nBig Blue\n\nElsewhere on Sunday, the New York Giants sealed their place in the playoffs with a dominant 38-10 victory over the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nGiants quarterback Daniel Jones threw for two touchdowns and ran for two more as New York returned to the postseason for the first time since 2016.\n\nIt caps off a dramatic improvement under first-year head coach Brian Daboll after five straight losing seasons and underperformance.\n\nBut the resurgence of running back Saquon Barkley and a burgeoning defense has led the Giants to a 9-6-1 record and place in the playoffs.\n\nGiants fans celebrate a touchdown during the second quarter against the Colts. Vincent Alban/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nAs is tradition when a team reaches the playoffs, Daboll was doused in Gatorade in celebration when the win was assured.\n\nA smiling Daboll described the victorious celebrations as \u201csticky and wet.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was good excitement, obviously,\u201d Daboll said, per the Giants website.\n\n\u201cYou work hard in this business to try to give yourself a chance to play extra innings or more games. So, we have done that. We put ourselves in a position to compete more than just one other game. So, excitement, sure. Definitely.\u201d", "label": "human"}
{"text": "In this article DIS Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nwatch now\n\nDisney chose to rehire Bob Iger as chief executive after receiving internal complaints from senior leadership that Bob Chapek was not fit for the job, according to people familiar with the matter. The executive change came together quickly, blindsiding Chapek and his closest allies. Disney's board reached out to Iger on Friday, without any other serious candidates in mind to replace Chapek as CEO, CNBC's David Faber reported Monday, citing sources. The board's outreach to Iger and discussion to replace Chapek came after the board married internal complaints about Chapek's leadership with concerns following Disney's most recent quarterly earnings report, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private. One of the executives to express a lack of confidence in Chapek was Christine McCarthy, Disney's chief financial officer, two of the people said.\n\nChristine M. McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer The Walt Disney Company. Source: The Walt Disney Company\n\nMcCarthy was Iger's CFO before he departed as CEO in 2020, holding the role since 2015. She has an established relationship with the board given her longevity in the position, the people said. A Disney spokesperson declined to comment. Chapek didn't respond to a request for comment. On Sunday, Disney said it would replace Chapek with Iger as chief executive, effective immediately. Iger has agreed to serve as CEO through the end of 2024, and will earn a $1 million base annual salary, Disney said in a regulatory filing Monday. The compensation package includes an annual bonus target of 100% of his annual salary, with an annual target of $25 million for a long-term incentive award. Chapek had a base salary of $2.5 million, with an annual target of $20 million, which was increased from $15 million when his contract was renewed earlier this year. He is reportedly in line to receive a severance package of at least $20 million. Chapek had come under fire for his management of Disney in the last few years. Chapek was notified on Sunday night, Faber reported. Chapek and his inner circle were caught off guard by the news, one of the people said. The status of Chapek's right-hand man, Kareem Daniel, is murky and dependent on the direction Iger wants to take at the company, two of the people said. Daniel leads Disney Media and Entertainment, a division created through Chapek's reorganization of the company. Iger has never been a fan of the reorganization, which has caused internal consternation for nearly two years.\n\nChapek complaints", "label": "human"}

And, yet, this idiot will continue watching games.\n\nCommissioner Roger Goodell is under fire for not quickly postponing Monday night\u2019s Buffalo-Cincinnati game after Bills safety Damar Hamlin collapsed on the field. The seriousness of the situation was immediately obvious, with tearful teammates kneeling in a circle around Hamlin as medical personnel performed CPR. We would later learn that he had suffered cardiac arrest and twice needed his heart restarted. He remains hospitalized in critical condition.\n\nAfter Hamlin was taken away by ambulance, it took the NFL a ridiculous 36 minutes to tell everyone to go home. If there had been a way to look more insensitive, the league surely would have found it. It\u2019s what the league does.\n\nThis is the outfit that gave quarterback Deshaun Watson a measly 11-game suspension after 24 women accused him of sexual misconduct. Watson settled most of the lawsuits they filed. This is the league that hasn\u2019t acted in Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa\u2019s best interests as he\u2019s struggled with concussions. This is the league that initially made it harder for Blacks to prove mental declines linked to football in the NFL\u2019s $1 billion concussion settlement.\n\nAll this (and more), and I watch the game anyway.\n\nWhy that is is something I\u2019ve asked myself for a long time and something I\u2019m asking myself now. It has something to do with emotional distance. I know that the players are flesh and blood, know that they have families, and know they deal with problems like the rest of us, but when I see them on TV, all of that falls away. What\u2019s left is a show with bulked-up actors, with heroes and villains, with athleticism and violence, with commercial breaks. It\u2019s phenomenal entertainment.\n\nA football game is real. The hits are real. The blood is real. The injuries are real. And death is a possibility \u2014 remote, but still a possibility. It\u2019s not my blood, though, not my knee ligament getting torn, not my day to die. So it\u2019s not real in a way I can feel. I watch boxing and mixed-martial arts, too. I\u2019m drawn to the idea of one person trying to knock out another, as long as neither of them is me.\n\nIt\u2019s a strange stew \u2014 the sixth-grader who landed on his tailbone in a pick-up game of tackle football and vowed never to play again, and the adult drawn to the brutality of the sport.\n\nAll the bad stuff \u2014 the league\u2019s tepid response to revelations about chronic traumatic encephalopathy, its seeming disregard for women, etc. \u2013 is real. The game \u2013 the viciousness and the gore \u2014 isn\u2019t.\n\nWhat is that disconnect all about? How many millennia does one have to go back to understand why a human being would enjoy watching people beat the crap out of each other? I wasn\u2019t comfortable with my son playing high school football (he did anyway) because I was concerned about his health. But I can\u2019t stop watching the NFL, no matter how barbarous it is. And no matter how unfeeling the people are who run the league.\n\nThat\u2019s the emotional distance I referred to earlier. People who love murder mysteries probably would stop reading them if a loved one was murdered mysteriously. And people who love to watch football might have a hard time watching again if a loved one was seriously injured in a game.\n\nBut free of that burden, and blind to all the warning lights blinking in my head, I watch because the NFL is what I said it was earlier \u2013 phenomenal entertainment. Superior athletes. Obsessed coaches. Highs and lows. The occasional tragedy to confront from one\u2019s couch. Bundled in weekly three-hour packages. I\u2019m not proud of it, but it\u2019s part of me.\n\nI cover the NFL because it\u2019s in my job description, but I\u2019d watch the games even if this weren\u2019t what I do for a living. I\u2019m drawn to the incredible speed and the hard hitting, the very things that make the game so dangerous at the pro level. The league knows that there are tens of millions of people like me across the country. People who know all the rational reasons why they should say goodbye to a savage sport but won\u2019t.\n\nWe\u2019ll question ourselves periodically, but mostly we\u2019ll just keep watching.

{"text": "In a world that is often busy with poses and the superficial shadow of our chaotic daily lives, it's no surprise that something like writer/director Andrew Cohn's feature film Living has become so popular. The film tells a simple and heartbreaking story of three teenage best friends living in a small Midwestern town, growing up with the consequent ups and downs. The chemistry of James (Max Duchaine), CJ Rivera, and Sidney Bolt doesn't take long, which is where the power of the story really begins to shine. Their conversations, jokes, and personal struggles all draw you into the narrative, bringing them reality and humanity that makes it hard for them to tear themselves apart. As a result, the film became increasingly popular in independent circles and has been described as \"an adult 'after-school special'.\" At the heart of the story is James' struggle to maintain family unity, his single mother (Josie Morales) being relocated on the verge of rehearsal, and his father (Tom Bower) struggling to make ends meet. The other two leaders, Jerry and Casey, faced their own struggles as they struggled to understand their identities and insecurities. One of the most powerful aspects of their story is how two very different people from two very different backgrounds came together to help each other grow and become better people. It's a simple story with something compellingly sincere and honest that you can relate to, whether you're a teenager or an adult. The emotions and feelings it evokes - joy, pain, sadness, fear - are universally accepted, which is why it was so successful. Life may not be considered an original film in any sense, but it depends on proven and authentically mature traits and experiences that are the reason why it is so relevant. It's funny rather than superb, sad more than happy; it touches your heart without overexpanding. The film's narrative naturalistic approach makes it so special, but it is also worth mentioning that Cohen uses music to increase the emotion of his work. Every kind of music - from folk numbers accompanying more touching moments to infectious synthetic epidemics through adventure scenes - contributes to Living's unique atmosphere and adds a surreal yet real texture to the storyline. Life may not be a breakthrough movie, but it is a special film; it will surely capture the hearts of viewers and provide much-needed comfort and stimulation. It may be full of familiar beats and plots, but it tells stories that we can all relate to, whether we are teenagers or adults.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "For the first time in years, Chicagoans face an election cycle that could bring about a radical change for the city's police union and its controversial leader, John Katanzala. Since his election in 2019, Katanzala has been a vocal and confrontational figure in the Chicago Police Union, often at odds with Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Chief Constable David Brown, and many police reform advocates. Now, Katanzala, who will be re-elected in 2021, is facing a challenge from the reformist leader, Sergeant Cynthia Donald, 41. Donald is challenging the platform for police reform and accountability in Katangara, unlike the fierce rhetoric of current union leaders and sharp criticism of the city's leadership. Over the past 17 years, Donald has worked at the Chicago Police Department (CPD) and is currently a sergeant in the department's community policing unit. She says her leadership role in the department has led to measurable improvements in police-community relations and built trust between residents and the police. \"I understand that in order to build trust, I have to be open to feedback from the community, from our stakeholders, from our officials so we can work together and reach a consensus on how to move our police department forward,\" Donald said. In stark contrast to Katanzala's confrontational approach, Donald promised a more cooperative approach to leading the union. She also said she would use her position to push for increased police training and greater transparency in disciplinary measures against officers. \"We need to be transparent, we need to be open, we need to make sure our officers get the training they need and that they understand the rules, regulations and laws that they have to follow,\" Donald said. Donald's campaign has attracted police reform advocates, including Black Lives Matter Chicago and the Police Accountability Grassroots Alliance (GAPA). Both groups have supported Donald on the grounds that she is concerned about police reform, racial justice, and accountability. \"Sergeant Cynthia Donald has the unique experience, skills and voice that our union desperately needs,\" said Areva Karen Winters, executive director of GAPA, adding: \"Her election will be an important step in the transition to a community-centric model of public safety, transparency and accountability for the CPD.\" Donald's campaign also drew support from the Police Charity and Protection Association (PBPA), which represents more than 14,000 active and retired police officers. The coalition supported Donald with reference to her experience and her willingness to work with the city in finding solutions to the city's crime problem. \"Cynthia Donald is a breath of fresh air under the leadership of John Katanzala,\" said PBPA President Emmet Farmer, \"and she understands the importance of cooperation and collaboration between police officers and the communities they serve, which is critical to our public safety mission.\" Despite Donald's growing support, she will still have to overcome the difficult challenges of Katangala, which is likely to run a well-funded and high profile campaign. Katangala is already leading in polls, but as the election season draws near, the battle for union leadership may well be a long and controversial one.", "label": "machine"}

Police in Moscow had been looking for a white Hyundai Elantra as a possible piece of evidence.\n\nA probable cause affidavit, with details supporting Kohberger\u2019s arrest, is under seal until he sets foot in Idaho and is served with the papers in court, authorities said. LaBar said Saturday that Kohberger intends to waive his extradition hearing in Pennsylvania on Tuesday to face charges in Idaho soon after.\n\nThe Kohberger family is expected to be present for the extradition hearing, LaBar said.\n\nInvestigators have said they still need the public\u2019s help to \u201cunderstand fully everything there is to know not only about the individual but what happened and why,\u201d according to Latah County Prosecuting Attorney Bill Thompson.\n\nThree of the victims \u2014 Goncalves, Mogen and Kernodle \u2014 were roommates at the home where they died, while Chapin, Kernodle\u2019s boyfriend, was staying the night, investigators said.\n\nTwo other roommates who were home at the time were asleep during the stabbings, and one of their cellphones was used to call 911 when they woke up later that morning, detectives said.\n\nThe murders generated headlines nationwide and about 19,000 tips from the public that police said were crucial to the probe.\n\nFamilies of the victims say they are hopeful that Kohberger's arrest will bring justice.\n\nKernodle's mother, Cara Northington, said Friday that the arrest of a suspect in the case lifted \"a huge weight\" off her shoulders, adding that she does not know Kohberger.\n\n\u201cA lot of the grief was not knowing who this was, knowing that whoever was responsible for that is still out there,\u201d she said. \u201cSo yeah, this definitely takes a lot of the grief that we were experiencing off our shoulders.\u201d\n\nKohberger, who was a doctoral student in the criminal justice and criminology department at Washington State University, 9 miles from Moscow, was known to make \u201ccreepy\u201d and inappropriate comments to female employees and customers at a Pennsylvania brewery, the business owner told NBC News on Saturday.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Over the years, the U.S. armed forces have retired a small number of weapons and tactics that are outdated due to the combination of cost and changing technology. But in some cases, they reappeared and ushered in new enemies, and proved themselves capable of this task. After retiring in the late 1980s, the A-10 Warthog attack aircraft served in the Middle East and other battlegrounds around the world in response to the global war on terror. Although it is aged and lacks some of the more sophisticated techniques found on modern jets, it has been a horse for the U.S. Air Force, making it one of the longest killing lists in U.S. military history. For more than a century, the U.S. military has found multiple uses for the same old equipment. Here are three examples of American troops bringing back \"obsolete\" weapons and tactics to deal with new enemies. The Gatlin Gun Designed in 1861 by American inventor Richard Gatling, it used multiple chambers in a rotating projectile capable of firing multiple bullets over short periods of time. It became an important weapon in the civil war and continued to serve in conflicts such as the Indian War and later the Spanish-American War. Although the Gatlin guns were replaced by more modern weapons such as M2 Browning machine guns, the U.S. military realized the value of their provision of repressive firepower and decided to restore it. Initially equipped with a bulletproof shield that protected the operator, they were later replaced by an open high-visibility installer. Colt 1911 The Colt 1911 is one of the most iconic pistols ever designed by gun inventor John Moses Browning in 1911, and was a standard access arm for the U.S. Army until it was replaced by Beretta 92 in 1985. Although largely retired from service in 1911, it never completely left the U.S. arsenal. It reappeared during the war in Afghanistan, when special operations forces realized that the pistol was still a reliable and powerful weapon. The 1911 pistol was washed away and equipped with modern features such as extended beaver tail grip security measures and other modifications to allow the gun to remain in service for much of the 21st century. The Dogs of War Military dogs have been used for centuries in a variety of roles, from guard duties to search and rescue. But perhaps the most famous example of military dogs in action is the German Shepherd Rin Tin Tin, who first served during World War I before continuing to star in numerous films. A particularly notable example is Cairo, where the Belgian Malinois military dog took part in a raid that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011. Dogs like Cairo have proven valuable to U.S. forces in the Middle East for reconnaissance, tracking and other operations. In Conclusions The U.S. military, one of the most capable combat forces in the world, has proven time and again that it can adapt to the changing demands of modern warfare. In recent years, weapons such as Gatlin Guns, Colt 1911, and Army Dogs have seen a resurgence, and have been shown to be fully capable of dealing with new enemies.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nFresh from a trip to the bloody front lines in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky strode onto the ornate US House floor on Wednesday evening in his signature green military wear to shore up his supply line.\n\nOn the dais where heads of state usually sport suits, Zelensky embraced the look of a warrior as he used confident English to claim \u201cjoint victory\u201d in what he said was the defeat of Russia in the \u201cbattle for minds of the world.\u201d\n\nAlthough he did not mention the elephant in the room, the speech was a clear plea to Republican lawmakers, who will control the House in January, to stay with Ukraine.\n\n\u201cYour money is not charity,\u201d he said, calling it an \u201cinvestment\u201d in democracy.\n\nHe later asked that support for Ukraine remain \u201csolid, bicameral and bipartisan.\u201d\n\nHis remarks came as Congress had been planning to vote this week on a year-long spending bill that includes roughly $45 billion in emergency assistance to Ukraine and NATO allies.\n\nA speech before power changes hands and a plea for more money\n\nIf the speech felt rushed \u2013 most lawmakers weren\u2019t told about it until Tuesday \u2013 it was.\n\nWednesday was perhaps the last possible day Zelensky could have addressed a joint meeting of Congress before Republicans, some of whom are slowly growing tired with the largesse of America\u2019s support for his country, take control of the House next month. The US has provided more than $21 billion in defense assistance in less than a year. That includes $1.8 billion in a new weapons deal announced when Zelensky met President Joe Biden at the White House earlier Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIs it enough? Honestly, not really,\u201d Zelensky joked in his speech to Congress, drawing on his background as a comedian.\n\nLater he observed that Ukrainians will be celebrating Christmas by candlelight, \u201cnot because it\u2019s romantic, no, but because there will be no electricity.\u201d Russia has destroyed much of the country\u2019s infrastructure and electrical grid.\n\n\u201cEven if there is no electricity, the light of our faith in ourselves will not be put out,\u201d Zelenksy said.\n\nInvoking US history, this time to hold the line\n\nZelensky previously spoke to US lawmakers by video back in March. \u201cWe need you right now,\u201d he said at the time, early in the conflict, when he compared daily Russian strikes on Ukraine to Pearl Harbor and 9/11, attacks that shocked the United States.\n\nHe returned to US military history Wednesday, referring to the Battle of the Bulge during World War II, when US troops were surrounded in the snow after gaining a foothold in Europe on D-Day.\n\n\u201cJust like the brave American soldiers, which held their lines and fought back Hitler\u2019s forces during the Christmas of 1944, brave Ukrainian soldiers are doing this same to Putin\u2019s forces this Christmas,\u201d Zelensky said.\n\nEstablishing the US and Ukraine as allies\n\nThe historian Doris Kearns Goodwin compared Zelensky\u2019s address to one given by Winston Churchill on Boxing Day in 1941 after the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s already established in the American people\u2019s mind we\u2019re in this together, but then pointing out that they\u2019ll do the fighting for us \u2013 \u2018just give us the tools and we will finish the job.\u2019 That\u2019s what Churchill said,\u201d Kearns Goodwin told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper Wednesday evening.\n\nThat\u2019s an important perception for the US since Ukraine, importantly, is not an official member of NATO, the treaty alliance Putin fears. One major reason the US has not provided more direct aid to Ukraine is concern that Putin would be provoked against NATO.\n\nGiving Zelensky a singular platform\n\nAn address to Congress is the ultimate platform for a foreign president in the US and maybe around the world. It\u2019s in contrast to Vladimir Putin, who canceled his annual year-end press conference.\n\nZelensky\u2019s appearance was facilitated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as one of her final acts before relinquishing the speaker\u2019s gavel. Earlier this year she took a surprise visit of her own to meet with Zelensky in Kyiv.\n\nHe handed over a simple Ukrainian flag signed by troops from the besieged area of Bakhmut to Pelosi, asking lawmakers to think of it and support Ukraine. She handed him an American flag that had been flown over the US Capitol, which he carried out of the chamber.\n\nWednesday\u2019s White House reception could not have been the one Zelensky envisioned years ago when he faced then-President Donald Trump\u2019s call for him to investigate Biden in exchange for military aid. And now Zelensky was thanking Americans for their help against Russia in the very chamber where Trump was impeached three years ago for pressuring Zelensky.\n\nMessage for Putin\n\nThe spectacle of Zelensky being celebrated in the heart of American power must be a nightmare for Putin, who thought this war, which started about 300 days ago, would be over quickly.\n\n\u201cIt was very important for him (Putin) and everyone else to see that President Zelensky and I are united, two countries together, to make sure he cannot succeed,\u201d Biden said, standing alongside Zelensky at the White House during their joint news conference.\n\nBut at the same time, it\u2019s clear to Zelensky, and also to Biden, that this is the time to re-engage the US public as Russia\u2019s war drags toward its one-year marker with no indication there is an end to fighting on the way.\n\nNo obvious way out. And no specifics on a peace summit\n\nUkraine has performed better than anyone expected last February, when Russia invaded, but that brave fighting, with help from hardware from the US and other NATO countries has won Ukraine the beginnings of a stalemate, not the end of Russian occupation.\n\nWithout specifics, Zelensky endorsed the idea of a peace summit for this winter. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has previously floated the idea of Russia retreating out of areas it invaded since February. Zelensky has argued Russia should retreat even out of territory it claimed in 2014. Putin has not suggested he would retreat at all.\n\nUkraine\u2019s No. 1 backer\n\nThe speech was importantly symbolic because this was Zelensky\u2019s first trip outside of Ukraine since the war began and he came to \u201cthe country that more than any other, perhaps more than all the others put together, has enabled his country to defend itself so far,\u201d said former CIA Director and retired Army Gen. David Petraeus before Zelensky\u2019s remarks.\n\nPetraeus added it was substantive because of the new money pledged to Ukraine both at the White House and in a larger $1.7 trillion spending bill lawmakers need to pass before Friday.\n\n\u201cDoing that before the next Congress is very important and I don\u2019t think the timing of this is just purely coincidental,\u201d Petraeus said.\n\nWhere the aid is helping\n\nThe Patriot missiles the Biden administration will send to Ukraine have gotten so much attention as a defensive system that could help protect Kyiv and the country\u2019s electrical grid. But it\u2019s the ammunition included in the new weapons package and the precision-guided rockets that will help Ukraine be on the offensive.\n\nIn addition to the money directly for Ukraine, the larger year-end spending bill includes an increase in US defense spending that will help American weapons and ammunition stockpiles depleted by support sent to Ukraine.\n\nPetraeus nodded to these realities when he said the timing of Zelensky\u2019s speech \u2013 and his plea for continued support \u2013 is not by accident.\n\nOptics are important\n\nHouse GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, who wants to be House speaker and needs votes from Ukraine-skeptical Republicans to get there next month, did meet with Zelensky and the other three top congressional leaders.\n\n\u201cI support Ukraine but I never support a blank check,\u201d McCarthy said after the speech. \u201cWe want to make sure there\u2019s accountability for every money that we spent.\u201d\n\nA majority of Americans remain behind supporting Ukraine and keeping sanctions on Russia, according to recent polling, but in a December survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, the share of Americans who believe the US should support Ukraine for \u201cas long as it takes\u201d dropped 10 percentage points since the summer to about half. Just a third of Republicans supported indefinite support in the survey.\n\nThe only Ukrainian-born member of Congress, Indiana GOP Rep. Victoria Spartz, has expressed skepticism about some of the aid to Ukraine and concerns about corruption in Zelensky\u2019s administration.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Early last month, Washington was abuzz with rumors about Sam Bankman-Fried's coming Christmas party.\n\nBankman-Fried, the CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, was preparing to host a blowout celebration. The details were a closely held secret, but politicos gossiped about which musical artists might headline, and whether Tom Brady \u2014 the legendary football champion turned FTX evangelist \u2014 might make an appearance.\n\n\"They were planning on having a party of the century,\" recalls Miller Whitehouse-Levine, the policy director of the DeFi Education Fund, a crypto nonprofit. \"The talk on the town was it's going to be the craziest DC Christmas party ever.\"\n\nThe all-out holiday bash was designed to serve as the triumphant capstone of two years of lobbying and networking by Bankman-Fried. Even by the ethically challenged standards of Washington, the 30-year-old billionaire had devoted an unprecedented level of time and money to influencing the regulators and lawmakers responsible for overseeing his business. He established himself as one of the Democratic Party's most generous donors, second only to George Soros. He funded a nonprofit advocacy group that engaged in partisan political lobbying, throwing lavish parties at a $3 million townhouse it purchased in Washington. And relying on the infamous \"revolving door\" between regulatory agencies and the companies they regulate, he hired a team of former federal officials to help him shape federal policy to his advantage.\n\n\"I think it's safe to say that he was, by far, the most engaged crypto CEO in Washington,\" says Adam Kovacevich, the CEO of Chamber of Progress, a trade group that FTX was a member of before its collapse.\n\nFor his efforts, Bankman-Fried made significant headway in pushing legislation that would have allowed exchanges like FTX to effectively self-regulate, making their own determination about whether the cryptocurrencies on their platforms complied with federal rules. He also worked to steer regulatory oversight of crypto to an agency with a far smaller enforcement staff than the Securities and Exchange Commission. Washington was largely asleep at the switch when it came to crypto, giving Bankman-Fried an opportunity to drive the train.\n\nNow, in the weeks since FTX was forced to declare bankruptcy, there has been much hand-wringing about the financial house of cards that Bankman-Fried built. What happened to billions of dollars in corporate funds that remain unaccounted for? Why didn't FTX's investors ask tougher questions about the business? What will become of all the backers and customers who have been wiped out in the crypto meltdown?\n\nBut in the midst of the financial devastation, one question remains largely unanswered: Why didn't the numerous regulatory agencies and congressional committees that are charged with safeguarding financial investors and consumers catch on to what was happening at FTX? How was Bankman-Fried, a millennial trader turned entrepreneur now facing numerous government investigations, able to so quickly and deftly infiltrate the most closely guarded corridors of power in Washington? Why did the system of regulatory oversight set in place nearly a century ago, after a banking crash plunged America into the Great Depression, fail so spectacularly?\n\nThe answer is simple, according to more than a dozen Washington insiders, FTX employees, and crypto industry observers who spoke with Insider. Over the past two years, Bankman-Fried set out to rig a notoriously rigged system through a potent mix of charm, charitable giving, and political contributions. From planning the \"party of the century\" to crafting industry-friendly legislation, SBF made himself a mover and shaker in Washington to a degree that other CEOs only dream of.\n\n\"He understood that Washington, in particular, can be wooed through aggressive fundraising and political giving,\" says Eric Soufer, a partner who leads the crypto and fintech practices for the strategic communications consultant Tusk Strategies. \"And that opens a ton of doors.\"\n\nIn FTX's early days, according to current and former employees, Bankman-Fried showed few signs of the vaunting ambition that would come to define his career. After graduating from MIT, the socially awkward 20-something worked in traditional finance for Jane Street, the high-frequency-trading shop, before opening his own crypto trading firm, Alameda Research. When he couldn't find a crypto exchange that offered the services he wanted, he launched FTX. The company, says one former employee, started \"pretty cautiously.\" Wearing the same clothes day after day, sleeping on his bean bag, and working long hours that colleagues and employees felt pressured to keep up with, Bankman-Fried concentrated on developing FTX's core product.\n\nIt wasn't long, though, before he began to broaden his horizons. Long a disciple of effective altruism, a school of thought that holds that people should use data and rationality to guide their morality and charitable giving, Bankman-Fried decided to bring the Silicon Valley philosophy to bear on the political sphere as well.\n\nWhen it came to Washington, he already had family connections to draw on. In 2018 his mother, the Stanford law professor Barbara Fried, had founded a political action committee called Mind the Gap, which advises Democratic donors on which candidates and causes to support. To guide its recommendations, the PAC employs what it calls \"rigorous research\" and \"quantifiable metrics\" \u2014 a mindset that echoes Bankman-Fried's philosophy of effective altruism.\n\n\"His mom was running a PAC,\" says a former crypto executive who spent time lobbying in Washington. \"So there is a comfortability and familiarity with the importance of access in DC.\"\n\nIn addition to his mother's influence in Democratic circles, Bankman-Fried had another resource that opens doors in Washington: lots and lots of money. In 2020 his firms, FTX and Alameda Research, contributed more than $10 million to Joe Biden's campaign. That kind of cash, especially from a newcomer, made instant waves in Washington. SBF had arrived.\n\nAfter spending more than $10 million to help elect Joe Biden, SBF became the second-largest donor to Democrats \u2014 and landed a meeting in the White House. AP Photo/Matt Slocum, File\n\nTo hear Bankman-Fried tell it, helping to put Biden in the White House convinced him that politics was a worthwhile investment. \"My goal,\" he told Recode not long after Biden took office, \"is just to find out how I can do the most good. And I had a long list of things to look at, at least briefly. And politics has always been on that list, and I've been fairly skeptical of it. It sort of had the hallmarks of something that would be just overcrowded, not that impactful, and like a trap for dollars in general. And so that's the way I thought before looking into it.\"\n\nNow, fresh off the 2020 election, Bankman-Fried threw himself into politics in earnest. Part of the influence he exerted was due to Guarding Against Pandemics, an initiative he funded to improve America's preparedness for infectious-disease outbreaks. Directed by his younger brother, Gabriel, the nonprofit advocacy group quickly established itself as a power center in Washington circles. Earlier this year, Puck reported, the group spent $3.3 million to purchase a four-story townhouse in the Capitol Hill neighborhood and used it to host high-profile political parties, including a Democratic Night and a Republican Night.\n\nAnd what did Bankman-Fried expect in return for his party favors and political contributions? All he was looking for, he told Recode, was \"the place I could be most useful\" to Biden. Then, in a telling aside, he offered another thought.\n\n\"I don't think Biden's ever going to put much thought into it,\" he said. \"But if [the administration] is ever looking for, like, an expert on crypto regulation\u2026.\"\n\nIt sounded like a joke. But Bankman-Fried, it turns out, had just revealed his new job description.\n\nEver since crypto burst on to the scene, morphing in just a few short years into a new financial superpower, Washington has struggled to keep pace. To make matters worse, two separate agencies \u2014 the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 have been engaged in a turf war over who will lead oversight of the burgeoning crypto industry. Regulation was clearly coming to exchanges like FTX. The only question was: Which agency would be chosen to guard the digital henhouse from the crypto foxes?\n\nIf you were a crypto billionaire in favor of less stringent regulation, your clear choice would be the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The CFTC, which works primarily with professional traders, has a staff of only 700. The SEC, which is charged with protecting individual investors, boasts a staff of 4,500. The CFTC's enforcement staff is even tinier \u2014 some 170 attorneys spread across the entire agency, compared with the 50 lawyers and analysts whom the SEC devotes exclusively to crypto. What's more, Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, is a crypto skeptic who has brought numerous enforcement actions against crypto companies, going after everyone from the crypto giant Ripple to the mega-influencer Kim Kardashian.\n\nFTX was a crypto exchange, facilitating buy and sell orders for crypto-focused hedge funds and other professional traders. But Bankman-Fried had bigger ambitions. In May, when the firm launched a product for buying US stocks, the FTX executive Brett Harrison told the Financial Times that the goal was to \"become the 'everything exchange' and the 'everything app' when it comes to financial services and fintech in general.\" To do that, Bankman-Fried needed the blessing of US regulators.\n\nIn meetings, Bankman-Fried presented himself to lawmakers and regulators as that rarest of creatures: a crypto billionaire who actually favored government oversight of his business. He and his team at FTX \"were seen as being very pro-regulatory,\" says Whitehouse-Levine of the DeFi Education Fund. \"That was an impression they actively cultivated, which differentiated them from what certain regulators might consider to be the more intransigent crypto lobby at large. They brought institutional credibility, combined with a message that many people in Washington were eager to hear.\"\n\nBankman-Fried won over lawmakers by painting himself as that rarest of creatures: a crypto billionaire who actually wanted more oversight of his industry. Getty Images\n\nAccording to a former executive at FTX, Bankman-Fried told Washington insiders that customers would be best served if bitcoin futures and spot markets were regulated by the same agency. He also pointed out that as much as 97% of crypto derivatives activity was happening outside the United States, in less-regulated venues. Bringing that activity onshore, he argued, would strengthen the market and give the US a dominant position in crypto derivatives, much like the one it holds in traditional financial markets.\n\nBut while both positions seemed regulatory-friendly, they implicitly favored handing crypto to the CFTC, which oversees derivatives and futures. At the same time, Bankman-Fried went on a shopping spree, hiring the best advisors from the CFTC who money could buy. In August 2021, FTX brought on Ryne Miller, a former lawyer for the commission. That November, it hired Mark Wetjen, a former CFTC commissioner who had long advocated the agency's involvement in the crypto industry, to serve as its head of policy. It also retained J. Christopher Giancarlo, a former CFTC chair who is now a partner at Willkie Farr & Gallagher, a white-shoe law firm that counted Thomas Edison among its earlier clients.\n\nMost of the team was in place when, on a Tuesday that October, Bankman-Fried met with Gensler. The SEC chair had asked crypto exchanges to come through the front door and voluntarily register with the agency. Joining Bankman-Fried in the meeting, according to the chair's calendar, were Miller, Giancarlo, and Harrison, FTX's president of US operations.\n\nBankman-Fried presented himself as a friendly voice of reason and cultivated relationships with the rank-and-file congressional staffers who do much of the heavy lifting in writing legislation\n\nOver the course of that meeting and others, FTX executives made several proposals about how they thought crypto exchanges should be regulated. One idea was to register the operations as an alternative trading system, a venue commonly known as a dark pool. That would have given the SEC oversight, according to a person with knowledge of the proposal, and put FTX on the path to becoming the first fully regulated crypto exchange. But Gensler and his staff didn't like the idea, which would have resulted in less regulation for crypto exchanges. They countered by suggesting FTX register as a so-called Form 1 national security exchange, which would subject the company to more stringent rules.\n\nBankman-Fried was undeterred. Unlike other crypto CEOs who avoided or even antagonized regulators, including Changpeng Zhao of Binance and Brian Armstrong of Coinbase, he decided to embark on an all-out charm offensive. According to those who attended meetings where he spoke, Bankman-Fried presented himself to Washington insiders as a friendly voice of reason and cultivated relationships with the rank-and-file congressional staffers who do much of the heavy lifting in writing legislation. Despite Gensler's protestations, he even managed to make inroads with the SEC staff, according to a person familiar with the relationships.\n\nAll told, Bankman-Fried recently told The New York Times, he spent \"thousands of hours\" in the nation's capital trying to woo regulators. \"That was not a money thing,\" he insisted. \"That was elbow grease. That was just asking again and again to have meetings with relevant regulators and submitting hundreds of thousands of pages of documents.\" His keenness to engage \u2014 and the outsize wealth and celebrity that accompanied him \u2014 enamored him to Washington. \"An industry needs a leading voice to act on behalf of the industry,\" the former crypto executive says. \"He was a willing resource.\"\n\nAs Bankman-Fried met with regulators, he also began splashing huge amounts of money around in political and philanthropic circles. Over the 18 months before FTX's implosion, he donated some $40 million to election campaigns and PACs, most of it in support of Democratic candidates. Others on his team, meanwhile, invested heavily on the other side of the aisle. Ryan Salame, a senior executive at FTX, donated $23 million, most of it to Republican efforts.\n\nThe money didn't go unnoticed. In March, as The American Prospect reported, eight members of Congress \u2014 four Republicans and four Democrats \u2014 wrote a letter to the SEC that questioned its authority to require crypto companies like FTX to provide information to the agency. FTX employees had donated between $2,900 and $11,600 to five of the signers. The company and Salame combined had given $2.75 million to a super PAC associated with the National Republican Congressional Committee, which is headed by the letter's lead signatory, Rep. Tom Emmer.\n\nBankman-Fried also spent more than $1.5 million on Washington lobbyists to promote his interests. FTX put Conaway Graves Group, Empire Consulting Group, Rich Feuer Anderson, and T Cap Solutions on the payroll, while Bankman-Fried's advocacy group Guarding Against Pandemics hired Van Scoyoc Associates, Capitol Counsel, Ogilvy Government Relations, and Ridge Policy Group. In the second and third quarters of this year, according to lobbying disclosures, FTX paid $540,000 in fees to lobbyists.\n\nAt the same time, FTX was also handing out huge sums in charitable donations, which served to bolster its political aims. The company managed the FTX Future Fund, a philanthropic endeavor that claims to have given out more than $190 million, and it continued to dispense money through Guarding Against Pandemics. The dual initiatives \u2014 feel-good philanthropy combined with old-fashioned politicking \u2014 made it hard for politicians to ignore Bankman-Fried's requests for meetings. According to one person familiar with those sessions, cryptocurrencies and pandemics would sometimes come up in the same conversation.\n\nBankman-Fried has insisted his political giving was purely selfless, driven by an altruistic desire to support candidates who're \"outspoken in favor of doing things now to prevent the next pandemic.\" But others say the message of combining philanthropy and politics was crystal clear to everyone involved. \"Most people's sense was that they were distinct but not entirely unrelated,\" says Soufer of Tusk Strategies. \"Remember, SBF fashioned himself as a high-water mark for the contemporary philanthropist. I don't think anyone believed that he was going to fund candidates who were, quote unquote, committed to ending pandemics who were also hostile to the crypto industry.\"\n\nTo politicians who knew little to nothing about how crypto works, Bankman-Fried seemed like the Steve Jobs of digital assets. FTX was backed by top-tier venture capitalists like Sequoia Capital and Tiger Global Management. \"Their investors brought a lot of credibility,\" says Whitehouse-Levine of the DeFi Education Fund. The company organized Crypto Bahamas, a glitzy Caribbean conference where Bankman-Fried rubbed shoulders with Bill Gates and Tony Blair, and he gave speeches at think tanks like the Bipartisan Policy Center. He wooed the media, investing in the buzzy global news startup Semafor, donating $5 million to ProPublica, and helping to fund a vertical on Vox focused on effective altruism. He even talked to Elon Musk about investing in Twitter, and had previously bought up some of the company's stock \"with an eye toward acquiring Twitter himself,\" Semafor reported.\n\nAn advisor to Bankman-Fried put it succinctly. \"Think about if you're doing Marc Benioff slash Bill Gates \u2014 like you're building basically the reputation as a philanthropist, a political donor, a power broker, and an entrepreneur, all at the same time. So you're doing Gates, Soros, Bloomberg, all while you're actually building the companies that made them money.\"\n\nThe aura of all the big names who surrounded Bankman-Fried helped paper over his odd behavior. A senior crypto industry figure who attended meetings with him in Washington said lawmakers were sometimes aggravated by the way he presented himself, wearing shorts to meet with elected officials and swearing liberally. \"There were many times where he and I would be in the same place and he would fuck up the messaging in front of congresspeople or senators and it was super annoying,\" the person says. \"But I and many others chalked it up to the typical 'he must be super high IQ and low EQ' sort of engineer in Silicon Valley.\"\n\nOne of SBF's advisors put his lobbying efforts in terms favored by the VCs who were enthusiastically backing FTX: \"He just wanted to build this flywheel of domination.\"\n\nFTX also went on a massive branding push, affixing its name to sports stadiums and signing up celebrity spokespeople including Tom Brady, Stephen Curry, and Larry David. The effort turbocharged its name recognition outside traditional crypto circles, says Kevin Werbach, a Wharton business professor who appeared alongside Bankman-Fried at a congressional hearing. \"The FTX logo was extraordinarily visible around the world,\" Werbach says, \"even to many people who were not holders of digital assets.\"\n\nWooing Washington was an all-fronts war, and Bankman-Fried proved to be a master at waging it. Through his high-profile efforts, he forged a reputation as a crypto genius that made him impossible to ignore in Washington. One of his advisors put it in terms favored by the venture capitalists who were enthusiastically backing FTX: \"He just wanted to build this flywheel of domination.\"\n\nBy December 2021, Bankman-Fried had laid the groundwork for an appearance at a congressional hearing on regulating the cryptocurrency industry. Swapping his standard outfit of shorts and a T-shirt for a suit, he sat through questioning before the House Financial Services Committee, bolstering his reputation as the friendly and reasonable face of crypto. Hours later, he was back to his familiar antics on Twitter, where he jested with his die-hard followers about how he had failed to tie his shoelaces properly and how badly he had needed to pee during his testimony.\n\nThe following March, Bankman-Fried again visited Gensler at the SEC, flanked by Wetjen, Harrison, and Miller. This time he was also accompanied by Brad Katsuyama and other executives from the IEX exchange, who were considered white knights in the world of high-frequency trading. The meeting didn't go much better than the first one. Before the FTX executives got to the meat of their presentation Gensler interrupted them and went on a lengthy sermon about how he favored a more stringent regulatory approach. The SEC, at least, wasn't buying what Bankman-Fried was selling.\n\nBut Bankman-Fried's political giving and philanthropic endeavors earned him an audience at a far more influential institution: the White House. In May, CoinDesk reported, Bankman-Fried met with Charlotte Butash, a policy advisor to Biden's deputy chief of staff, and Steven Ricchetti, a counselor to the president. He was accompanied by Wetjen and Eliora Katz, recently hired as FTX's first in-house lobbyist. In just two short years, Bankman-Fried had gone from a little-known trader in a new industry to having the ear of the president's inner circle.\n\nSBF met twice with Gary Gensler, chair of the SEC \u2014 but Gensler rebuffed the CEO's regulatory proposals as insufficiently stringent. Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nRebuffed by the SEC, Bankman-Fried turned his attention to Congress. Over the summer, according to a senior crypto policy official, Bankman-Fried met with lawmakers privately almost every other week to argue for passage of the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act, a bill that would give the CFTC a key role in overseeing the crypto industry. He even suggested that the crypto industry might chip in to give the understaffed commission the resources it needed to implement the DCCPA, raising concerns about conflicts of interest.\n\nOthers in the sector opposed the measure, saying it was designed to favor FTX's interests over those of its rivals. Many critics cited concerns that it might hurt \"DeFi\" \u2014 decentralized finance projects that compete with exchanges like FTX. \"It's not that he was welcoming regulation,\" says the senior figure in the crypto industry who attended meetings with Bankman-Fried. \"It was that he was welcoming terrible, self-interested regulation that would have disadvantaged a lot of other companies.\"\n\nBut while Bankman-Fried was busy wooing Washington, FTX was about to become Exhibit A in the case for more effective oversight of the crypto industry. As the company proceeds through bankruptcy, legal filings paint a grim picture of FTX's inability to control even the most fundamental aspects of its business. The company failed to keep track of what assets it held, or even whom it employed. James Bromley, a lawyer for the company, said in court that FTX was \"run effectively as a personal fiefdom of Sam Bankman-Fried.\" The man many Washington regulators and lawmakers viewed as crypto's foremost expert is now under investigation by some of the same agencies and committees as crypto's biggest con man.\n\nBankman-Fried was hardly the first CEO to try his hand at the tricky business of cultivating political power. But what surprised veteran observers was the skill and determination with which he went about it \u2014 and how swiftly he succeeded. \"A lot of this is the playbook,\" says Niki Christoff, a political consultant in Washington. \"But it was done at sort of an accelerated speed \u2014 and in a way that was a little kludgy.\"\n\nAs any Silicon Valley engineer knows, a little kludginess is the price you pay for speed. What matters, in the early going, is producing a minimally viable product. And in the wake of Bankman-Fried's spectacular downfall, there are signs he may have accomplished something enduring. While the legislation he helped to bring into being, the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act, is given almost no chance of passing this year, some on Capitol Hill continue to support it, even in the wake of FTX's spectacular collapse. Rostin Behnam, who backed the measure as chair of the CFTC, told Congress last week that lawmakers should simply \"pause and look at the bill and make sure there are no gaps or no holes.\" And the bill's sponsors \u2014 Sens. Debbie Stabenow and John Boozman \u2014 intend to continue pushing for it.\n\nThis year, according to federal election records, Stabenow and Boozman received $32,400 in campaign contributions from none other than Sam Bankman-Fried.", "label": "human"}

He chose the US Constitution over the Bible or another religious book, and when the time comes, he\u2019ll also take his oath with three sentimental items, including the first edition comic of Superman.\n\n\u201cI've read almost all genres, but Superman is always the character that stood out and spoke to me the most,\u201d Garcia, a Democrat from California, told BuzzFeed News on Wednesday.\n\nReporters on Tuesday spotted the vintage comic book among the items laid out in the House of Representatives in preparation of the swearing-in of newly elected members. In a tweet, Garcia, who describes himself as a comic book nerd in his Twitter bio, acknowledged it was for him. He said he will be sworn in to Congress with the Constitution as well as a photograph of his parents, who both died during the pandemic; his naturalization paperwork from when he became a US citizen; and the first edition of Superman, which he borrowed from the Library of Congress.\n\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences.

Garcia explained to BuzzFeed News the significant role that comic books and superheroes had on him growing up as an immigrant.\n\n\u201cI learned to read and write English reading comics as a kid. Never stopped reading,\u201d he said.\n\nGarcia, who moved to the US from Peru, said that the values he grew up with while reading Superman are ones that he brings with him into his adult life and his new job.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI grew up mostly reading Superman comics, you know, truth and justice, an immigrant that was different, was raised by good people that welcomed them and always someone that if you look at Superman values, and caucus values, it's about justice, it's about honesty, it's doing the right thing, standing up for people that need support.\n\nPrior to being elected to Congress, Garcia served eight years as mayor of Long Beach, California.\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear when he\u2019ll actually be sworn in.

REUTERS/Remo Casilli\n\nSummary Pope Francis presides at funeral of his predecessor\n\nBenedict wanted simple funeral, Vatican says\n\nEx-pope was standard-bearer for traditionalist Catholics\n\nPope Benedict to be buried under St. Peter's Basilica\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVATICAN CITY, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Pope Francis presided at the funeral of former Pope Benedict on Thursday, delivering a homily comparing his predecessor to Jesus before tens of thousands of mourners, including some who shouted that he should be made a saint.\n\nBenedict's death on Saturday brought to an end a decade of the former and present pope living side-by-side in the Vatican and it was the first time in more than 200 years that a pontiff had led the funeral service of his predecessor.\n\nHis death was a loss for conservatives who yearned for a return to a more traditional Church symbolised by Benedict, who shocked the world in 2013, by becoming the first pope in 600 years to resign instead of reigning for life.\n\nAt the end of the funeral in St. Peter's Square, some people shouted in Italian \"Santo Subito!\" (Make him a saint now!). It was the same phrase used at the funeral of Pope John Paul II in 2005, although by many more people then.\n\nWhile three of the last five popes have been made saints, only around a third of all pontiffs have been canonised in the Church's 2,000-year history.\n\nFrancis, who sat for most of the service because of a knee ailment, rose at the end as Benedict's coffin was being carried away. Holding himself up with a cane he touched it while bowing his head in silent prayer.\n\nAt 86, Francis, who has been using a wheelchair but has shown no signs of slowing down, with trips planned for Africa and Portugal in the coming months, is a year older now than Benedict was when he retired.\n\nFrancis himself has made clear that he would not hesitate to step down some day if his mental or physical health prevented him from carrying out his duties, but Vatican officials always doubted he could do this while Benedict was still alive.\n\nHOMILY\n\nThe service started about two hours earlier when, to the sound of tolling bells, 12 pallbearers carried the wooden coffin holding Benedict's remains out of St. Peter's Basilica and placed it on the ground before the largest church in Christendom.\n\nThe last time a reigning pope had presided over the funeral of a predessor was in 1802, when Pius VII led the service for Pius VI, whose body returned to the Vatican after he died in 1799 in exile.\n\nIn his homily read while sitting before the altar, Francis used more than a dozen biblical references and Church writings in which he appeared to compare Benedict to Jesus, including his last words before he died on the cross: \"Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.\"\n\nDuring the Mass concelebrated by 125 cardinals, 200 bishops and about 3,700 priests, Francis spoke of the \"wisdom, tenderness and devotion that he bestowed upon us over the years\".\n\nHe mentioned Benedict by name only once, in the last line, saying: \"Benedict, faithful friend of the Bridegroom,(Jesus) may your joy be complete as you hear his voice, now and forever!\"\n\nClergy from around the world, a handful of heads of state and thousands of faithful attended the ceremony as the sun slowly broke through the fog.\n\nMore than 1,000 Italian security personnel were called up to help safeguard the event, and air space around the tiny Holy See was closed off for the day. Italy ordered that flags around the country be flown at half staff.\n\nItalian police said about 50,000 people were in the square.\n\n'LEFT HIS MARK'\n\nPeople from all over the world, many from Benedict's native Germany, arrived in the early hours to say farewell to Benedict.\n\n\"Even though at our age we were just children when he was pope, he left his mark,\" Xavier Mora, 24, a Spaniard who is studying for the priesthood in Rome, told Reuters as he approached the square with two other seminarians.\n\n\"We have been studying his theology for three years and even though we did not know him personally we have great affection and esteem for him,\" he said.\n\nAbout 200,000 people filed past Benedict's body while it was lying-in-state for three days until Wednesday evening.\n\nAn account of Benedict's papacy, along with other items, including Vatican coins minted during his reign, was also tucked into the coffin. The account, written in Latin, says he \"fought with firmness\" against sexual abuse by clergy in the Church.\n\nWhile many leading figures have praised Benedict since his death, criticism has also been aired, including by victims of clergy sexual abuse, who have accused him of seeking to protect the Church at all costs.\n\nEven though Benedict largely avoided public appearances in subsequent years, he remained a standard-bearer for Catholic conservatives, who felt alienated by reforms ushered in by Francis, including cracking down on the old Latin Mass.\n\nAfter the funeral ceremony, the coffin was taken back inside the basilica to be encased in zinc before being sealed in a second wooden casket.\n\nAt his request, Benedict will be buried later on Thursday in the underground Vatican grottoes in the niche where first Pope John XXIII and then John Paul II were interred before their remains were transferred to more prominent places in the basilica above.\n\nWriting by Philip Pullella and Crispian Balmer; Editing by Mark Heinrich, Muralikumar Anantharaman and Alison Williams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "A month ago, actor Jeremy Renner was tragically struck by an avalanche on the streets of Los Angeles when the 46-year-old spoke for the first time about the incident and his recovery. Renner is best known for his roles in \"Avengers\", \"Mission: Impossible\" and \"The Wind River,\" where he was struck by an avalanche on the afternoon of November 12 while helping a driver in need. Renner, who was taken to hospital for surgery with multiple fractures, has since been recovering at home. He posted an article on Instagram on December 3 sharing details of the accident and thanking his fans for their support. \"It's been a very difficult month, but I did well and healed,\" he wrote, \"I was too confused to type, but luckily I was still in the piece.\" Reiner said he was helping a trapped driver at the time of the accident and thanked the hospital's medical team for their help, as well as his family and friends for their support. \"My thoughts went to the snowball driver and someone told me he was also recovering,\" he added. Renner also asked his followers to be more aware of their surroundings when driving in bad weather, as it could be a \"dangerous combination of snow, cars and people on the road.\" Reiner has been relatively quiet since the accident. However, his recent posts suggest that he is slowly recovering in his footsteps. He has made his own recovery a closely-secret secret, saying in an Instagram post that he's not ready to return to work but is doing his best to get better. Lenner ended his article by thanking his followers for all their prayers and good wishes, and sending them his love. The actor, who has won Oscar and Golden Globe nominations, has proven that he is a person of character and integrity, and it's heartening to see that he still cares about helping others despite his own painful circumstances. Obviously, Renner's path to recovery is long, but hopefully the beloved actor will be able to recover quickly.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "I tried, truly, to resist the charm of that red beret. Didn\u2019t we all? Ever since the debut of Emily in Paris on Netflix in 2020, the series\u2019 audacieux fashion has drawn so much critical ire it\u2019s practically a running gag. Who wears that much color in Paris? Especially when they can\u2019t even speak French? And yet. Watching Lily Collins\u2019 divisive Emily Cooper step out in an acid-green Miu Miu coat in the show\u2019s third and latest season, I found myself struggling not to be swept up in the sheer joy of her devil-may-care wardrobe. A mishmash of clashing houndstooth, vibrant florals, neon gingham, light-catching sequins, and towering platform heels, her closet is as bottomless as her all-American energy. Emily Cooper\u2019s style is forever toeing the line between luxury and kitsch, which is precisely where costume designer Marylin Fitoussi likes to play.\n\nSourcing nearly 40,000 pieces for this particularly fashion-packed season, Fitoussi\u2014now the solo designer for Emily in Paris season 3, after collaborating with Patricia Field in seasons 1 and 2\u2014is never not collecting unexpected pieces for Collins to slip into. She sources luxury pieces, like the aforementioned Miu Miu coat and one particular Balmain fringe suit, from websites, individual collectors, and vintage stores like \u00d4dette Curated Vintage in Bordeaux and goodJo Paris. \u201cYou never have the right bags or the right shoe color,\u201d she says. \u201cIt sounds crazy. We had, like, 500 bags and\u2014it\u2019s not the perfect red; it\u2019s not the perfect shoe. It\u2019s always like that. It\u2019s desperate sometimes, but it\u2019s my passion.\u201d\n\nNever mind that Emily, an aspiring marketing executive, likely couldn\u2019t afford Dolce & Gabbana tops, Jean Paul Gaultier jackets, or Giambattista Valli gowns. Fitoussi couldn\u2019t possibly care less. (As she revealed in Netflix press materials, \u201cThe main lessons I learned from Patricia was her \u2018we don't care about reality\u2019 motto, which gave me great freedom regarding tone and spirit. I let go completely.\u201d)\n\nMore From ELLE\n\nThis season alone, Fitoussi says Collins wears 43 different looks over 10 episodes. Only a teeny handful of them feature exclusively what Fitoussi refers to as the \u201cFrench national colors\u201d: navy, black, and white. The rest are a kaleidoscope of magentas and turquoises and rust oranges and banana yellows, a break from Parisian reality Fitoussi is all too thrilled to take. \u201cIn Paris, if you take the metro in the morning, everybody\u2019s totally in black,\u201d she says. \u201cIt looks like a church. And people say to me, \u2018Oh, for once I\u2019ve discovered how good it feels to be dressed in color.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe takes a particular pride in the controversy Emily\u2019s closet choices have stirred up amongst both fashion and television fans. \u201cI'm happy that people hate the show,\u201d she says, smiling, \u201cbecause that means my duty, it\u2019s done. My mission is done. That means that what we can see on screen, it\u2019s strong, it\u2019s bold, it\u2019s not regular or ordinary.\u201d\n\nAnd she knows exactly why, contrary to all our educated instincts, Emily in Paris\u2019 costumes continue to inspire even monochrome-addicted cynics like myself: It\u2019s fun. So if you long to shop and dress like Emily circa season 3, Fitoussi has plenty of tips\u2014as do we, all of which you\u2019ll find below\u2014but remember one thing above all. \u201cIn Paris, they call me the parrot; they call me the clown because I'm dressed in color,\u201d Fitoussi says. \u201cDon\u2019t care. You need to be unique and you need to be yourself. So play with clothes.\u201d\n\nAhead, you\u2019ll discover some of Emily\u2019s best looks this season, as well as ideas for where you can find either the exact items, similar dupes, or in-the-same-vein alternatives.\n\nLook 1\n\nSt\u00e9phanie Branchu/Netflix\n\nChic knits are indeed a Parisian staple, but trust Emily to shred the rulebook with iridescent shorts and lime-green knee-high boots from Maison Skorpios. The resulting silhouette is as good a guidepost as any when it comes to styling a l\u00e1 Emily: Find mixed patterns and textures that share a color family, then layer them on with glee. And never neglect a high heel. Says Ashley Park, who plays Emily\u2019s roommate Mindy, \u201cMarilyn really found like this rhythm of, like, not just putting on an outfit, but really making a look out of everything.\u201d\n\nLook 2\n\nSt\u00e9phanie Branchu/Netflix\n\nEarly in season 3, Emily dons a gorgeous Paco Rabanne silver-and-violet high-neck sequin gown. You won\u2019t find the exact piece available online today, but a sequin dress is one of the relatively few modern trends Emily indulges in this season, so there are plenty of sparkly alternatives to be found if you\u2019re coveting the style. Just don\u2019t forget to pair with some sort of color.\n\nLook 3\n\nSt\u00e9phanie Branchu/Netflix\n\nEmily bares some midriff with this classic look, in which she pairs a Barbara Bui sequin blazer from the designer\u2019s Pre-Fall 2017 collection with a check-print bandeau from lingerie label LIVY. That exact bandeau will be available until Emily in Paris fans snap up all the stock, but other options include gingham crop tops or\u2014if you\u2019re bold enough\u2014bikini tops.\n\nLook 4\n\nNetflix\n\nIt\u2019s almost difficult to believe Emily is bummed during the scenes in which she wears this gorgeous Mira Mikati pastel blazer. The resulting look is so joyful it feels counterintuitive to watch our protagonist struggle with indecision. But perhaps that\u2019s the real idea behind Fitoussi\u2019s clashing patterns in this look: \u201cCooper,\u201d as her boyfriend Alfie calls her, is caught between two worlds.\n\nLook 5\n\nNetflix\n\nCollins herself is partial to this Dolce & Gabbana look, which, she tells ELLE.com, \u201clooks kind of like a zebra and an elephant combined with the little micro shorts.\u201d Emily styles them with a set of eye-popping Louboutin platforms, which were mere prototypes at the time Collins wore them. \u201cI just loved the combination of those things amongst the neon of Pierre Cadault.\u201d\n\nThe D&G top isn\u2019t available to shop online, but you can evoke the same aesthetic with a zebra-print jacket, tiny black shorts, a pair of transparent black tights, and some gleaming silver heels. (Or you can opt for the actual Louboutins, if you\u2019ve got some cash to burn.)\n\nLook 6\n\nNetflix\n\nOn a trip to Provence midway through season 3, Emily matches the picturesque skies in this light blue polka-dot midi with a torso cut-out. The billowy long sleeves add an extra layer of romanticism as she dines with will-they, won\u2019t-they love interest Gabriel, one of the few characters not constantly outfitted in neon. You\u2019ll find a few similar dress options below to test-run on your next date night, plus a few Emily in Paris-inspired accessories\u2014including a Pierre Cadault-branded tote ideal for your next European vacation.\n\nLook 7\n\nNetflix\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring an event with Maison Lavaux and McLaren, Emily dons this Giuseppedi Morabito mini with a voluminous lavender jacket to welcome guests to the party. Fitoussi\u2019s had the dress sitting around since season 1, but she says she could never find the right pieces to pair it with. Finally, ahead of season 3, she stumbled upon the ideal flounced jacket from Iris Apfel\u2019s collaboration with H&M, released earlier this year. It\u2019s the perfect example of Fitoussi\u2019s mentality: Luxury fashion can go with budget buys, so long as you know how to mix them.\n\n\u201cTry to see beauty everywhere because every piece can be interesting,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd sometimes you don\u2019t know at the moment how are you going to style it, but keep it.\u201d\n\nLook 8\n\nNetflix\n\nFor Emily Cooper\u2019s idea of athleisure, abandon your LuLuLemon and look no further than this anorak-and-turtleneck combo courtesy of La DoubleJ. The striking cherry pattern might not be anything particularly outrageous for Emily\u2019s wardrobe, but at your local gym, the look is certain to spark a few double-takes. Better yet, pair the top and jacket with joggers for your next airport excursion\u2014and make sure you pack season 2\u2019s infamous Pierre Cadault suitcase.\n\nLook 9\n\nNetflix\n\nSays Fitoussi, some of the season\u2019s best looks\u2014including this adorable sunflower-inspired get-up\u2014came to fruition through creative fusion with Collins. \u201cI can have a feeling if I get it wrong, or if she prefers that, or if she has also any suggestions,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m pleased that she\u2019s now able to say to me, \u2018I really feel comfortable, or I feel beautiful, or could we...?\u2019 [We] have this beautiful relationship now with no hard feelings; we can say, \u2018Okay, let\u2019s try this. What do you think?\u2019\u201d That artistic process led to this look, which combines a light-pink lace top with a yellow blazer, kerchief, lavender socks, and yellow gingham platforms. Is it practical? Of course not! C\u2019est la vie.\n\nLook 10\n\nNetflix\n\nYou might notice in season 3 that, in rare moments, Emily\u2019s allowed a true Parisian mentality to rub off on her wardrobe. She wears more neutrals\u2014though always in some sort of pattern\u2014and she\u2019s started to embrace more elegant French silhouettes, as you\u2019ll find with this wide-leg pants look.\n\n\u201cI think now it\u2019s time for her to embrace, a little bit, the French culture,\u201d Fitoussi says. \u201cShe decided to stay in Paris. She was observing the way Sylvie was dressing, the way of Camille was dressing. We can see that this love-hate game between both of them means that Sylvie is now taking some color of this young and a little bit arrogant young American ... and this young American girl is saying, \u2018Oh, the high-waisted trousers with the wide legs, that\u2019s so iconic about Sylvie\u2019s silhouette. [Can] I can take it and do it in my own style?\u2019\u201d", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Biotech has been a \"stock-pickers market\" \u2014 and it may have just what it takes to remain one in 2023, according to Citi. \"Biotech is currently a stock-pickers market, with focus on companies with near-term catalysts, active debates, and strong fundamentals that could continue to drive outperformance in various recession scenarios,\" Citi said in a December note. But performance within the sector will vary with the economy's. Under a bad recession scenario, Citi prefers names with large cash balances and which have already commercialized drugs, or which are on the verge of drug approvals. Some names that meet those criteria include Apellis Pharmaceuticals , Acadia Pharmaceuticals and Amylyx Pharmaceuticals , Citi said. The reverse would be the case in the event of a mild recession, as investors would be more willing to explore names with cheap valuations, according to Citi. It said, however, that even in such a scenario, \"more mature pipelines with good cash balances would not fall out of favor.\" \"In an intermediate base case landing scenario, we presume there may be some rotation to the safer names with longer cash runways, though we would still expect biotech investors to find the low market cap names with short cash runways as interesting high-risk opportunities,\" Citi added. Top picks for 2023 Citi named some top picks for the year ahead. 1. Beam Therapeutics The bank said its work in sickle cell disease has potential to produce a superior product. Its pre-clinical pipeline could also \"drive long-term value across a number of large market opportunities.\" \"[Its] strong cash position makes BEAM attractive even in a hard-landing scenario,\" Citi said. It gave the stock a target price of $62, or nearly 69% upside. 2. Apellis Pharmaceuticals Citi said Apellis needs to capture only a \"modest\" market share to achieve about $2 billion in peak sales, based on the bank's model. It gave the stock a target price of $86, or about 73% upside. 3. Karuna Therapeutics Karuna has many opportunities to expand its late-stage work on schizophrenia, which could drive $4 billion in peak sales if successful, Citi said. \"Further, in a hard landing/recession scenario, interest from long-only investors and generalists could persist as derisked names with near-term revenue opportunities are favored,\" the bank said. It gave the stock a target price of $279, or 45% upside.", "label": "human"}
{"text": ".. 2022 will be a dynamic year for the climate movement, both in terms of policy changes implemented by governments around the world and growing public awareness and engagement on addressing climate change. Despite this challenging and unpredictable year, there are still some highlights, including six notable achievements and successful climate action that should celebrate the upcoming New Year. U.S. Returns to Paris Climate Agreement In early 2021, the United States rejoined the Paris Agreement, a global climate agreement that aims to limit global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius or less. This marks a major milestone in bringing the United States back into global efforts to address the climate crisis. The U.S. was one of the first countries to ratify the agreement during the Obama administration, but the Trump administration withdrew from it in 2017. 2) Enterprise sustainability work is at the center stage This year, many companies have made significant commitments to achieve carbon neutrality, invest in renewable energy and improve overall sustainability. Some notable promises this year include Amazon's $2 billion climate pledge, Walmart and Apple's commitment to carbon neutrality by 2030, and Nestle's commitment to net zero by 2050. 3) Cleaner modes of transport are gaining momentum In the United States, the Biden administration has made electric vehicles a major part of its climate plan, while China is investing heavily in the EV market. This year, Tesla launched its first electric pickup truck, and many automakers are investing in both electric and hybrid models. 4) Renewable energy investment surges This year, global investment in renewable energy reached a record level, with spending on green energy surpassing fossil fuels for the first time. This represents a significant shift from the past decade, when most of these investments were directed toward oil, gas and coal. 5) Climate education is becoming more popular This may be due in part to many extreme weather events this year, such as Australia's bush fires, record-breaking hurricanes and devastating flooding around the world. As awareness of the climate crisis grows, schools and universities need more climate education. 6) Carbon pricing gains are dragging on In recent years, carbon pricing has become one of the most effective ways to reduce emissions and incentivize businesses and individuals to abandon fossil fuels. This year, significant progress has been made in this area, with some countries having established or expanded existing carbon pricing schemes. While these six climate victories are worth celebrating, it's also important to remember that more needs to be done to achieve net zero emissions and address the climate crisis. The actions taken this year are a good start, but it is critical that governments and businesses continue to take meaningful action in the years ahead.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Tom Brady and Mike Evans remind them why they are the best combination in football, with Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterbacks dropping four shots, three of which were when Evans won the NFC Southern title in a dramatic fourth quarter rally that beat the Carolina Panthers on Sunday at 46-23. This victory made Bucs (10-5) the first team to win 10 games this season, as well as the first team to get a place in the playoffs. It also won Brady's career 13th division title and marked his 30th fourth quarter return victory of his career. The race seemed to have slipped from the Bucs at the start of the fourth quarter, as they were 23-19 behind. But Brady ended the day with a season's high of 399 passes, and he organized a wonderful 23-point rally. He started the sport by completing one game against Cameron Brate, a 13-yard touchdown. Booker then forced three straight wins, creating the conditions for Brady's second contact with Evans. The future Hall of Fame linked his favorite 35-yard score goals together to give Booker their first lead in the game, 26-23 points. In the following game, Brady took Bucs to the pitch before defeating Evans for a third connection of the match. This time, it was an 18-yard score that pushed the lead up to 33-23. It was the fifth time this season that two men had three contact ends in one game. The Bucs will add two more ground touches, one from wide receiver Chris Goldwyn and the other from a newcomer running back to Ke'Shawn Vaughn, expanding their lead to 46-23. The game showcased Brady's brilliance, as he often found open receivers and delivered passes accurately. He also scattered the ball around because eight different players had received pass from him. But the real star of the show is Evans, who has received 13 receptions in a season of 232 yards high and three touchdowns. This is the sixth time in his career that he has scored at least three touchdowns in one game and set an NFL record. Buchanel's defense also rose sharply in the fourth quarter, forcing two rounds of errors and preventing the Leopard from returning. Defender Devin White had a bag and an interception in the fourth quarter, while defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul had a key bag to keep the Leopard from regaining its leading position. This victory is the sixth time that Bucs has won the NFC South title since 2002, with four teams led by Brady. The victory also made Brady the first quarterback in NFL history to win a division title with three different teams. For Brady, it's another milestone in his legendary career. And for the Bookers, it's a declared victory that shows they are a legitimate Super Bowl competitor. With offensive shots of all cylinders and high levels of defensive play, Tampa Bay looks ready for an in-depth playoff.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "As part of its product push during CES 2023, HP has revealed a ChromeOS counterpart to its premium Dragonfly Pro laptop. The Dragonfly Pro Chromebook is a professional-grade portable for business execs and digital content creators who are deep into Google's online ecosystem. It's also the first mainstream Chromebook with a gaming-laptop-style RGB-backlit keyboard.\n\nDetailing the Dragonfly Pro Chromebook\n\nHP hasn't yet shared the price of the Dragonfly Pro Chromebook, but it's clearly a high-end model that HP says is aimed at freelance or contract professionals. The chassis, crafted from recycled magnesium and aluminum and available in white or black, holds a 12th Generation Intel Core i5-1235U processor (two Performance cores, eight Efficient cores, 12 threads) with integrated graphics. Backing up the 15-watt CPU are 16GB of memory and a 256GB NVMe solid-state drive.\n\n(Credit: HP)\n\nDescribing the Chromebook's ports doesn't take long, because all you'll find are four USB4 Type-C ports with Thunderbolt 4 support, with two on either side of the laptop. These will do all heavy lifting in terms of accessory support and charging, though you may need a few adapters to get by (notably a USB-C DisplayPort dongle for an external monitor). Up-to-date wireless connectivity includes Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2. HP says the Dragonfly Pro Chromebook boasts an 8-megapixel webcam that should make it a star for video meetings.\n\nThe company also boasts that the laptop's 14-inch IPS touch screen is the brightest yet seen on a Chromebook, delivering up to 1,200 nits of luminance and showing 100% of the sRGB color gamut. The display provides 2,560-by-1,600-pixel resolution.\n\nThe First RGB Backlit Keyboard on a Mainstream Chromebook\n\nHowever, there's something about the Dragonfly Pro's keyboard that makes us love the screen even more: its RGB backlighting tuned to the primary screen color. Recent gaming Chromebooks from Acer, Asus, and Lenovo were the first to feature RGB keyboards, but the HP is the first mainstream or productivity-focused Chromebook to have one.\n\nWe can't speak to the keyboard's typing feel or the unit's overall build quality, because the system we saw at a pre-CES demo was a pre-production unit. But it did flaunt the kicky feature codeveloped by HP and Google: the keys' backlighting syncs to the hue of the background wallpaper, glowing green, for example, if the desktop shows a mostly green image.\n\n(Credit: HP)\n\nAI-powered RGB backlighting doesn't exactly count as a revolutionary boost in productivity, but it's certainly fun to have and a trend we'd love to see take hold. More RGB for everyone!\n\nThe Dragonfly Pro Chromebook experience is sustained by all-day battery life\u2014HP estimates its unplugged runtime at around 11 and a half hours. If you're a contract professional and spend your day in Google Workspace, you should safely get through a full workday plus an evening of streaming entertainment. Like the Windows Dragonfly Pro, the ChromeOS model supports HP's fast charging, promising to go from an empty battery to 50% capacity in just half an hour. It sounds like it's going to be hard to run out of battery life with this Chromebook, but we'll be the judge of that when we get a production unit in hand.\n\nImpressive and Flashy, But Will It Serve a Need?\n\nWe're impressed by our first look at the HP Dragonfly Pro Chromebook; it's a handsome system with cutting-edge connectivity, plenty of performance, a superior screen, and a cute keyboard gimmick. Admittedly, we're not sure how many freelance and contract professionals have joined the growing number of corporate IT managers choosing Chromebooks for business, especially at what's likely to be a premium price, but stay tuned for our full review this spring.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Web hosting may be the internet's most underappreciated element. Everything you love about being online\u2014podcasts, memes, articles, tweets, websites, online gaming, Netflix content\u2014lives on a server that an individual or company pays to keep up and running so that you can access it. In short, web hosting is an invisible, essential element of the online experience.\n\nIf you're considering, say, launching a website, there are several basic web hosting aspects that you should be familiar with before starting the project. Although it's relatively easy to sign up and use a provider's supplied website-building software to swiftly create an attractive, functional front end, there are a lot of related terms and concepts to wrap your head around. As you'll soon see, some of it is confusing, if not outright contradictory. Here's what you need to know about web hosting before opening an account.\n\n1. There's a Big Difference Between Hosting Types\n\nIf you've spent any amount of time on a web host's website, you've probably seen terms like shared, VPS, dedicated, cloud, WordPress, and reseller. They represent the different web hosting types, but not every web host offers them all. Plus, the hosting types differ from one another in significant ways.\n\nNearly every web host offers shared hosting, the cheapest form of web hosting. With shared hosting, your website shares a server and server resources with many other sites. If you want to keep your web hosting budget small, and don't expect much traffic, shared hosting is the way to go. You should expect to pay less than $10 per month for this web hosting type. This level of hosting is really best suited for small sites that don't need a huge amount of bandwidth, however. Since you're sharing resources with other sites, you should be prepared for the occasional slowdown should one of your site-mates start attracting a lot of visitors. Free web hosting is available if you're on a tight budget, but it comes with its own caveats (typically ads and extremely low server specs).\n\nLarger businesses that expect big traffic to their sites should pick VPS or dedicated hosting, each of which offers increasingly powerful server specs. VPS hosting is like a high-powered version of shared hosting, except that far fewer websites share a server's resources, which are also a bit more segregated. VPS hosting costs more than shared hosting, but you should pay less than $100 per month.\n\nDedicated hosting places your site on a server all by itself, so it can leverage a server's full power. This is the most expensive type of hosting; you may end up paying $100 per month or more for this raw power.\n\nReseller hosting lets you start your own branded web hosting business without worrying about building the infrastructure from scratch. WordPress hosting lets you build a site in an environment that caters to the world's most popular content management system. And cloud hosting? That's an entirely different beast that lets you easily scale website power across multiple servers, though not every web host offers it. Yet. The pricing for these hosting tiers are all over the place, so shopping around is vital.\n\nCheck out our various explainer articles (linked to in the paragraphs above) for a deeper dive into each hosting type.\n\n2. Bandwidth Isn't the Same as Data Transfer\n\n\"Bandwidth\" and \"data transfer\" are frequently used interchangeably to define the amount of data that your website serves to visitors, but the terms, technically, do not have the same definitions.\n\nBandwidth represents the total amount of data that can be transferred at one time, while data transfer is the throughput or the actual amount of information that can be used over a given period of time\u2014typically a month. Think of it like this: a web host may have a maximum 5GB bandwidth, but depending on your hosting plan, your site may only allow 1GB of data transfers per month.\n\nNote: If your website exceeds its allotted monthly data transfers due to a Reddit hit, for instance, a web host may slow your site's data transfer speeds or charge you a fee as a penalty. It may even prompt you to upgrade to a higher web hosting tier. It's good to know your site's data limitations before you run into situations like this.\n\n3. Unlimited Isn't Quite Unlimited\n\nWeb hosts will entice you to sign up for their web hosting plans by tempting you with the promise of unlimited storage or monthly data transfers. It's generally not a completely honest deal. Now, I won't say that these web hosts are straight up lying, but the \"unlimited\" storage or data transfers boasts nearly always have limitations that vary by company. FatCow, for example, offers \"oodles\" of disk space, and states that there's no cap on a user's content\u2014as long as that person remains fully compliant with the company's terms of service and utilizes storage \"for the normal operation of your FatCow website.\" It's just like the bottomless shrimp buffet: Eventually a restaurant will cut you off, if they don't simply run out of shrimp first.\n\nUnlimited storage and data transfers are typically associated with shared or WordPress plans, and they let you run wild\u2026within limits. If your blog gets a steady stream of reasonable traffic (whatever that may mean!), you'll be in good standing. However, you shouldn't expect to upload or stream 50TB of data per day. The average joe isn't doing that is likely dabbling in some questionable activities.\n\nYou should consult a web host's terms of service, or a customer service representative, to learn exactly what you can and cannot do within the scope of your plan's unlimited offering. For example, DreamHost states on its website that the company doesn't track \"bandwidth or traffic, so you never have to worry about pesky overage fees.\"\n\n4. The Hard Disk Drive/Solid-State Drive Tradeoff\n\nIf you're looking to sign up for shared web hosting, you'll likely receive real estate on traditional hard disk Drive (HDD) server. The advantage of an HDD-based server is that it can offer large storage amounts on the cheap. As you move up the hosting ladder to more powerful offerings, such as VPS and dedicated, web hosts will give you the option to build a site on a solid-state drive (SSD).\n\nSSD-based servers are lightning-fast storage units. SSD technology is still pretty pricey, so your SSD-based servers typically carry much smaller storage totals than HDDs. You'll rarely see 1TB SSD servers, which is a number that's commonplace in the HDD arena.\n\nThe SSD vs. HDD discussion is a lengthy one that goes well beyond the scope of this article. I recommend reading Tom Brant's excellent SSD vs HDD: What's the Difference?\n\n5. A Linux Server Will Do...Most of the Time\n\nNearly every web host offers Linux as the operating system that powers their servers. In fact, I don't think I've reviewed a web host that lacked the free, open-source OS. Even if you aren't familiar with Linux, you don't need to do any special work on the back end to build a website. Website builders make building sites a breeze.\n\nThat said, if your site needs the ASP or ASP.NET scripting frameworks, you'll need to run with the Windows Server operating system. That's because the script your write and webpages your produce will only function in a Windows-based environment.\n\n5 Things You Need to Know About Web Hosting 5 Things You Need to Know About Web Hosting\n\nThere's an additional benefit: Microsoft apps, such as Office or Outlook, integrate with the server with ease. The downside? Windows servers are incompatible with Linux-based, open-source software unless you do some tinkering. In addition, Windows servers cost approximately $10 to $20 more than their Linux equivalents, but if you need Microsoft's tools it's a small premium. Linux vs. Windows: How to Pick the Best Server OS for Your Website breaks down everything you need to know about these operating systems.\n\nFor more web hosting tips, check out The Best Courses for Learning How To Build Websites and 10 Easy But Powerful SEO Tips to Boost Traffic to Your Website.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "A woman has gone viral online for documenting her missing luggage\u2019s wild adventure, from an apartment complex to a McDonald\u2019s, after United Airlines lost her suitcase.\n\nValerie Szybala took to Twitter on Sunday (1 January) to share how United Airlines lost her luggage. She used AirTags to track down her suitcase\u2019s bizarre location outside a residential complex, and discovered that her luggage wasn\u2019t the only one tossed outside by the dumpster and emptied.\n\nDespite telling United\u2019s customer support that her luggage was missing, she was told to \u201ccalm down\u201d and that her bag was \u201csafe\u201d at the delivery services distribution center.\n\nUnsurprisingly, that was not the case.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d just like everyone to know that @united has lost track of my bag and is lying about it,\u201d she began the viral Twitter thread, which now has 112k likes and 13.4m views.\n\n\u201cMy Apple AirTag shows that it has been sitting in a residential apartment complex for over a day. Out back by the dumpsters, I have found other emptied United Airlines bags,\u201d she wrote. Along with the tweet, Szybala included a picture of other suitcases strewn about the concrete complex.\n\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.\n\nShe continued by sharing screenshots of her conversation from a United customer service support chat. In the messages, Szybala wrote: \u201cThe Apple AirTag tracker that I have in my luggage indicates that it has been sitting in this residential apartment complex for several days.\u201d\n\nSzybala informed the customer service representative that there were \u201cempty United customer bags out by the dumpsters\u201d and asked why her luggage was taken to this location.\n\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.\n\nAfter not receiving a response, Szybala asked if the representative was still there, to which they replied: \u201cCalm down you [sic] bag is at the delivery service. We will deliver the bag to you, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\nPerhaps it was the response from the United customer service representative that enraged Twitter users the most, as many people pointed out the audacity in telling Szybala to \u201ccalm down\u201d.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe \u2018calm down\u2019 would have had me seeing red,\u201d replied one Twitter user.\n\n\u201cThis is wild,\u201d said someone else, before mentioning how they saw \u201crows and rows and rows\u201d of luggage at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey. \u201cA total mess\u201d.\n\nAnother person said: \u201cThat condescending \u2018calm down\u2019 would have had me acting an absolute fool in the DMs.\u201d\n\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences.

Update your settings here to see it.\n\nOne hour later, Valerie Szybala informed her followers that her AirTag appeared to be on the move and stopped at a McDonald\u2019s restaurant. \u201cMAJOR UPDATE: for the first time since Friday my AirTag (and hopefully luggage) appears to be on the move\u2026it\u2019s at a McDonalds? The plot thickens,\u201d she said, before adding in a separate tweet, \u201cANOTHER MAJOR UPDATE: My luggage AirTag has left McDonalds and returned to the apartment complex where it is being held hostage!\u201d\n\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.\n\nOn Monday morning, her AirTag appeared to be moving once again only to return to the apartment with the dumpster. By Monday afternoon, Szybala\u2019s luggage was finally returned.\n\nTaking to the popular Twitter thread, Szybala explained how she tracked down her luggage by \u201ccreeping around the building\u2019s garage\u201d and hoping to get a signal from her AirTag. She then received a \u201csketchy\u201d text message from DCA Couriers United, which said: \u201cI\u2019m delivering the luggage missing from your flight with AA/UA. I want to apologise for the inconvenience that you\u2019ve had with your bag. Imma deliver it to you today.\u201d\n\nThe courier explained that \u201cthe bag was given to me under a different passenger and I delivered your [sic] in a different address and had to go back to that place and pick it up.\u201d\n\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.\n\nBecause the message didn\u2019t match what Szybala\u2019s AirTag tracking had shown, she decided to call the number. When the man who sent the message picked up the phone, he told Szybala that he was just around the corner and drove back to meet her near the apartment complex.\n\nDespite her luggage now being home safe and sound, Szybala was left with many confused questions and not a lot of answers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that this guy was telling the truth, I suspect he was not. Nothing I\u2019ve been told by this guy or @United explains why my bag spent three days in an apartment complex garage, with occasional shopping excursions. I\u2019d still like some answers,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nThe two empty bags Szybala had seen by the dumpster were also gone by later on Monday. However, a building resident told Szybala that the suitcases weren\u2019t picked up by trash collection, but rather brought back inside by someone in the building, which \u201cadds to the sketchy factor for sure,\u201d she said.\n\nThe past three days were a wild journey for Szybala\u2019s once-missing luggage, so she concluded her viral Twitter thread by sharing some of the lessons she learned ever since United Airlines lost her bag.\n\nAmong the three lessons learned was that using a tracking device in your luggage \u201ccan be a lifesaver,\u201d travellers should take photos or inventory of their belongings in case they need to file a reimbursement claim, and to \u201cnever choose delivery\u201d over the pickup option if their bag arrives on a later flight.\n\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.\n\nUnited Airlines has yet to publicly comment on the case of the missing luggage, beyond Szybala\u2019s initial interaction with United\u2019s customer support chat.\n\nIn the wake of a winter storm that cancelled thousands of flights during the busy holiday season, the number of delayed or lost bags skyrocketed in 2022 alone. Last July, more than six bags out of every 1,000 checked in by passengers were at least temporarily lost, according to data from the US Department of Transportation.\n\nMeanwhile, 1,842 complaints about lost luggage were logged that month, more than eight times the complaints received in July 2021.\n\nThe Independent has contacted United Airlines and Valerie Szybala for comment.", "label": "human"}

For example, you can use Chase points to book travel through Chase, transfer them to airline and hotel partners at a 1:1 ratio, redeem them for cash back or merchandise, or cash them in for gift cards from an array of popular retailers, dining establishments, and more.\n\nYou can even redeem your rewards for gift cards to places like Lowe's or Home Depot, where you can use them to buy more supplies for projects around the home.\n\nFactoring in the welcome bonus, here are the rewards you'd earn on three different types of home-improvement projects, based on the pricing from Remodeling Magazine's cost versus value study:\n\nAsphalt roof replacement ($31,535): 91,535 Chase points, worth an average of $1,647.63 in travel\n\n91,535 Chase points, worth an average of $1,647.63 in travel Vinyl siding replacement ($18,662): 78,662 Chase points, worth an average of $1,415.92 in travel\n\n78,662 Chase points, worth an average of $1,415.92 in travel Garage door replacement ($4,041): 64,041 Chase points, worth an average of $1,152.74 in travel\n\nReview: Chase Sapphire Preferred card review\n\nChase Freedom Flex\u2120 : Best for buying supplies from Target\n\nThe Chase Freedom Flex\u2120 earns Chase Ultimate Rewards\u00ae points, which you can redeem for cash back at a rate of 1 cent per point. You can also use them for gift cards, travel, merchandise, and more through the Chase Ultimate Rewards portal. And, if you also hold an annual fee-incurring Chase Ultimate Rewards card, such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card, you can transfer those points to valuable airline and hotel partners, receiving an average value of 1.8 cents per Chase point.\n\nThe Chase Freedom Flex\u2120 does not charge an annual fee and earns 5% cash back on up to $1,500 spent in quarterly bonus categories after activation (then 1%) and 1% back on all other purchases. You also start off with a welcome bonus of $200 after spending $500 on purchases in the first three months from account opening.\n\nThis quarter's Chase Freedom bonus categories (January through March 2023) include Target, which offers a wide range of home remodeling products and supplies. Here's what you could earn with this card by using it to finance your home renovation (including the welcome bonus) \u2014 and the value you'd get if transferring points to travel partners:\n\nAsphalt roof replacement ($31,535): 57,535 Chase points, worth an average of $1,035.63 in travel\n\n57,535 Chase points, worth an average of $1,035.63 in travel Vinyl siding replacement ($18,662): 44,662 Chase points, worth an average of $803.92 in travel\n\n44,662 Chase points, worth an average of $803.92 in travel Garage door replacement ($4,041): 30,041 Chase points, worth an average of $547.38 in travel\n\nAnother bonus? The Chase Freedom Flex\u2120 offers a 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for the first 15 months (then a 18.74% - 27.49% Variable APR), which is great if you need some time to pay off your home improvement expenses.\n\nReview: Chase Freedom Flex card review\n\nBank of America\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards Credit Card : Best home improvement category bonus\n\nFor a lucrative combo of a long intro APR, decent bonus, and strong rewards rate on home improvement purchases, the no-annual-fee Bank of America\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards Credit Card is a great choice. Along with a welcome bonus offer of $200 cash rewards bonus after you spend $1,000 on purchases within 90 days of account opening, cardholders can take advantage of a 0% intro APR on purchases for the first 18 billing cycles and for any balance transfers made within the first 60 days of account opening (then a 18.24% - 28.24% Variable APR).\n\nWhere the card really shines is its bonus categories. Cardholders earn 3% cash back in one category of their choice (from a list of six that includes home improvement/furnishings purchases), 2% back at grocery stores and wholesale clubs, and 1% back on all other purchases. The downside is that the 3% (choice category) and 2% (grocery/wholesale club) rates only apply to the first $2,500 in combined purchases per quarter (then 1% cash back).\n\nIf you choose home improvement/furnishings as your 3% category for the quarter, you could potentially earn 3% back on $2,500 in spending (total of $75). Then, after your project is done, you can always switch your 3% category to something that better matches your current spending habits; the other eligible categories are gas, online shopping, dining, travel, and drug stores.\n\nHere's what you would earn with the Bank of America\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards Credit Card for our sample home improvement purchases (assuming home improvement/furnishings is your chosen 3% category):\n\nAsphalt roof replacement ($31,535): $565.35 in cash back\n\n$565.35 in cash back Vinyl siding replacement ($18,662): $436.62 in cash back\n\n$436.62 in cash back Garage door replacement ($4,041): $290.41 in cash back\n\nReview: Bank of America Customized Cash Rewards card review\n\nCiti\u00ae Double Cash Card: Best for flat-rate cash back\n\nIf you want to earn a flat rate of rewards on your home remodeling project without having to worry about where you shop, it's tough to beat the Citi\u00ae Double Cash Card. This card doesn't charge an annual fee, yet you'll earn an effective 2% back for each dollar you spend: 1% cash back (1 point per dollar) when you make a purchase and another 1% (1 point per dollar) when you pay it off.\n\nThe card technically earns Citi ThankYou points \u2014 not cash. But you can redeem points at a value of 1 cent per point as a statement credit, direct deposit, or check. If you also have the Citi Premier\u00ae Card or the Citi Prestige\u00ae Card (not available to new applicants), you can transfer your Citi ThankYou points to airline and hotel partners for a bigger value \u2014 1.6 cents per point, on average (per Insider's valuation of Citi points). Here's what you could earn by paying for your home projects with the card:\n\nAsphalt roof replacement ($31,535): 83,070 Citi ThankYou points, worth an average of $1,329.12 in travel\n\n83,070 Citi ThankYou points, worth an average of $1,329.12 in travel Vinyl siding replacement ($18,662): 57,324 Citi ThankYou points, worth an average of $917.18 in travel\n\n57,324 Citi ThankYou points, worth an average of $917.18 in travel Garage door replacement ($4,041): 28,082 Citi ThankYou points, worth an average of $449.31 in travel\n\nIn addition, you can save money on interest by consolidating balances from other cards and taking advantage of its 0% intro APR for 18 months on balance transfers made within 4 months of account opening (followed by a 18.24% - 28.24% Variable APR). It does not offer any sort of welcome bonus at this time.\n\nRead our guide to the best credit cards with 0% intro APR offers and low interest. If you're willing to earn fewer rewards, you can find credit cards with much longer 0% intro APR windows.\n\nReview: Citi Double Cash card review\n\nBest credit cards for home improvement frequently asked questions (FAQ)\n\nWhat is the best credit card for home improvement? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. It depends on your goals. Is your aim to earn free travel with your spending? Would you prefer cash back? Or maybe you know you won't be able to pay off your balance within a month or two, and you'd prefer a credit card that offers 0% intro APR. There really is no \"best\" credit card for home renovation that covers every situation. However, we recommend opening a credit card (or two!) with a large welcome bonus to help you rack up rewards quickly. You could easily achieve more than $1,000 in value from a single card bonus. Read our post on the credit cards with welcome bonuses of 100,000 points or more for some fun ideas.\n\nAre home improvement credit cards worth it? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Opening a credit card specifically for a home renovation project is an excellent idea. If you've got a lot of spending on the horizon, it's one of the best opportunities to open multiple credit cards and earn welcome bonuses for lots of cash back or rewards that you can either use to effectively discount your purchases or save for future travels. Just be sure you aren't going to carry a balance for an extended period of time, as the interest you'll incur can negate the rewards you earn. At that point, you're better off taking out a personal loan with low interest rates.\n\nCan you pay for home renovation on credit cards? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. You can almost always pay for home renovations with a credit card \u2014 however, the above scenarios we've examined are pricey. Not many people have a credit line over $30,000 to pay for a roofing project. Ensure that you can pay in increments if you don't have the credit line to cover the entire fee.", "label": "human"}

{"text": ".. A California woman searching for her missing suitcase recently benefited from Apple's AirTag, a device that tracks the journey from an apartment building in California to a local McDonald's. The woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that she was very frustrated after her suitcase disappeared from the apartment building in San Francisco. \"I searched everywhere but there was nothing. I was too afraid to be stolen and never see my things again.\" Worse still, she didn't know what was going on in her suitcase until a few days later, when she accidentally discovered the AirTag app that she had recently purchased. After downloading the app, the lady found out that her AirTag recorded movements of her suitcase in real time. The AirTag app shows that her suitcase has gone more than a mile from the apartment building to McDonald's near the Golden Gate Bridge. After further investigation, the woman discovered that her suitcase had been found by a witness in McDonald's parking lot and called police. Fortunately, with the help of the police, the woman was able to retrieve her suitcase. \"I'm happy to get my items back,\" she said. \"I'm impressed by the accuracy and speed of AirTag, I didn't know it could do anything like that.\" The woman's experience has been a national concern, with some expressing concerns about the potential security implications of AirTags. However, Apple insists that AirTag is safe, citing its powerful privacy and security measures. \"AirTag's design takes privacy and security into account,\" Apple said in a statement, \"and not only is AirTag safe and reliable, it can help people track their most important items and give them peace of mind.\" The company added that its \"Find Me\" network was designed to ensure that only people who were legitimately trying to help recover lost items could find AirTag. \"We are very careful to make sure that AirTag is not used in a 'wild' way,\" Apple said. Ultimately, the experience of women demonstrates the power of AirTag technology and its potential to help people find lost items. While it's too early to tell if AirTags will become a broad tracking tool, one thing is certain: Its use is limited to our imagination.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "When Kehau Hall set up her Airbnb glamping tent in 2014, she didn't think twice about it being roughly 10 minutes away from volcanos. She's used to their unpredictability, having lived in Hawaii since age 2 \u2014 and says she isn't threatened by them. \"Years ago from my mom's house, I could actually see one of the volcanoes erupting,\" Hall, 28, tells CNBC Make It. \"From her back porch, you could see the lava glowing at nighttime. It's just something you become accustomed to.\" Like her mother's home, Hall's glamping tent is in the Glenwood neighborhood of Mountain View, Hawaii, about 12 miles from the heart of the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park \u2013 which has two active volcanoes. Her inspiration for creating an Airbnb site was simple, she says: She saw a photo of a glamping tent in a magazine and thought it would be a unique way for mainlanders to experience Hawaii. She spent less than $300 on the tent and roughly $8,000 on amenities like a kitchen, an outdoor shower and a king-sized mattress. Now the property, which Hall says requires about 10-15 hours of work per week, earns her $28,000 per year in revenue, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It. Those earnings represent a sliver of a highly competitive tourism industry: In 2019, visitor spending on all of Hawaii's islands amassed $17.75 billion, according to the Hawaii Tourism Authority. The main island, where Hall's tent is located, brought in $22.4 million daily, on average. Hall's tent, by comparison is modest: It costs visitors about $70 per night. But to her, it represents independence \u2014 and the money she earns helps her spend more time traveling.\n\nA good use of inheritance\n\nHall, whose father is Hawaiian, grew up on the property: The 90 acres of land, which have been passed down through her family for generations, host a handful of family homes as well as wild pigs, cows and chickens. Hall says she partially set up her tent to share the property's natural beauty more broadly.\n\nHall's tucked away glamping tent costs roughly $70 per night and is about 12 miles away from the heart of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Kehau Hall\n\n\"I wanted to use the land for good, where other people could come and benefit from it and really immerse themselves in nature,\" Hall says. \"Nowadays, everybody's working. Everybody's connected to electronics. It's important to detach and relax from the virtual world for a moment.\" She had industry experience, too. In high school, Hall helped out at local bed and breakfasts \u2013 which also used Airbnb \u2013 and worked with a realtor to manage local rental properties. For four years, she also worked for the nearby national park. At age 20, she decided to lean into her entrepreneurial instinct and listed her glamping tent on Airbnb. She says it took about six months and five positive reviews for the tent to gain traction.\n\nGradual growth\n\nSince then, glamping reservations have remained fairly consistent: Hall says she averages three bookings per week, and the average guest stays for two-four nights. Before Covid hit, Hall says, the job felt like a Hawaiian daydream. She worked 10-15 hours per week managing the bookings and cleaning the property herself after every stay. She spent 15 additional hours per week helping manage other guest stays in homes on her family's large property, bringing her another $20,000 per year. Then, in March 2020, Hawaii issued a mandatory 14-day quarantine for travelers to prevent the spread of Covid. Tourism \u2014 Hawaii's \"largest single source of private capital,\" according to the Hawaii Tourism Authority \u2014 immediately plummeted. Between the first and second quarter of 2020, the state's unemployment rate jumped from 2% to 20.1%, according to Hawaii's Department of Business, Economic Development & Tourism. Hall suffered the effects: She received zero bookings for about six months, during which mainland travelers weren't allowed to visit Hawaii without abiding by a 14-day quarantine. She got by on savings and started cleaning personal homes to make money. Over those six months, she says, she lost most of her sources for disposable income and barely left her home \u2014 only to work or grocery shop.\n\nThe price of Aloha\n\nBusiness at Hall's glamping site picked back up in early 2021: Guests booked month-long stays with expanded options for remote work. With a more consistent cash flow, Hall says she now blocks off four weeks of the year to travel to the mainland or abroad.\n\nHall's glamping tent comes equipped with a king-sized bed, coffee pot, outdoor shower and wifi.

{"text": "With Paraguayans heading to the presidential election in April this year, the small South American country is experiencing political turmoil and its relationship with Taiwan is becoming an increasingly important issue. In Taiwan-Paraguay relations, the two main forwards are from parties with very different positions on this issue. One is the conservative Republican Mario Abdo Benitez, who has been a strong supporter of strengthening Paraguay's relationship with Taiwan. Benitez recently said that enhancing relations with Taiwan could play an important role in helping Paraguay improve its economic prospects. On the other hand, there is Efrain Alegre of the center-left Liberal Party, who has been critical of the current government's close relationship with Taiwan. Alegre believes Paraguay should focus on strengthening ties with other Latin American countries, particularly its neighbour Argentina, and calls for more investment in local infrastructure and education. During the campaign, both sides stressed the importance of their relationship with Taiwan, but it was only a few months before the vote and it remained unclear who the Taiwan government would support. Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen has so far taken a neutral position on the election, but some analysts believe that the government will soon make a decision to ensure that the issue does not become a contest for candidates. This issue is of particular importance to Paraguay, which is one of the few countries in Latin America that recognizes Taiwan as an independent State. By contrast, most countries in the region recognize the People &apos; s Republic of China and China does not formally recognize Taiwan as a sovereign State. Thus, Paraguay-Taiwan relations have been a source of political and economic tension in the region, and in recent years Taiwan has sought to strengthen ties with Paraguay through a series of economic and diplomatic initiatives, including the opening of the Taiwan Embassy in Asuncion. Nonetheless, there have been signs in recent months of tension between the two countries, with Paraguay's President Horacio Cartes criticized for not doing enough to protect Taiwan's interests in the region. At present, Taiwan is watching the election closely, but it is unlikely that the Taiwan government will make any clear statements before the final outcome. Who wins the election will determine Paraguay's relationship with Taiwan in the foreseeable future, so there is no doubt that Taiwan will watch closely.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "More than four years have passed since Donald Trump was elected President of the United States, and his Republican Party has been facing an increasingly complex dilemma. Despite Trump's inflammatory rhetoric, he still maintains close control over the Republican Party and attracts support from some of its most prominent elites. The relationship between Trump and the Republican Party has been complicated for years, with some members criticizing his rude style while others are eager to support him. So why have Republican elites like Senator Lindsey Graham, Senator Mitch McConnell and others supported Trump over the past four years? The issue has been controversial since Trump took office, and several key reasons can be identified. 2013 Electric Power Co Ltd The most obvious reason for the Republican support for Trump is that he has been their electoral asset. Since his election in 2016, Trump has maintained a strong base of supporters and helped the Republicans maintain control of both the White House and Congress. When Trump was impeached in 2019, almost all Republicans in Congress voted for his pardon. His strong base of support gave him a lot of influence, making it difficult for the party elite to oppose him. After Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) was one of the few Republicans who voted to convict Trump in an impeachment trial, he came under tremendous pressure from supporters of the president. Trump's loyalists issued death threats, threw insults and called on the Utah Senate to condemn Romney. Identity of Attribution For many Republican elites, supporting Trump is also a way to express their shared values and beliefs. Trump has a well-defined world view that resonates deeply with many members of the Republican Party. This shared ideology keeps Republicans united in the face of opposition, and many leaders see Trump's actions as a sidewalk. Even if he has said or done something that is considered beyond normal political discourse, many Republican elites have found ways to minimize the importance of this issue and maintain party unity. Pressure from the electorate That means party members must take into account al-Qaida's strong support for Trump. While Trump is unpopular among the broader electorate, Trump has been a popular figure among Republican voters who see him as a successful president and are fighting over issues that matter to them. While some openly criticize Trump, others do so silently, fearing that publicly opposing him could cost them their votes. This need to win elections has prompted many Republican elites to remain loyal to Trump, despite his controversial statements and actions. II. Conclusions While Trump has brought division and chaos to the party, many Republican elites have backed him with a mix of power, sense of belonging, and voter pressure. This complex relationship between the party and its leaders is likely to persist for the foreseeable future.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "(c) Capacity. On Sunday, Foxconn China announced its latest news - that the iPhone manufacturing plant in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, had reached 90% of its production capacity a week after it opened. This means that the world's largest iPhone factory has successfully implemented what Foxconn China originally planned to produce for 2021 and beyond. The large new complex, which began construction in the second half of 2019, is the result of Foxconn China's ten-year investment in Henan Province, covering an area of 1.3 million square meters and a workshop space of 4 million square meters, and has now become the world's largest single Apple supplier and electronics manufacturing center. Apple currently has an unprecedented capacity: the factory assembles 400,000 iPhones per day and peaks production at up to 500,000. It employs about 100,000 people and serves as a factory for many of Apple's popular products, including the iPhone 12 and 11. That's part of a larger trend, as Foxconn China continues to expand its production capacity following the coronavirus pandemic. The facility is by far the largest so far, and the next investment could be even bigger, with two more Apple-related projects in Henan province besides another giant plant under construction. The move to a larger Apple production facility will be critical for Foxconn China to meet growing customer demand. While the company still has the world's largest Apple line, it is also struggling to outperform other Chinese rivals such as HiSilicon in terms of quality and efficiency. More importantly, the Zhengzhou plant will play an important role in supporting Apple's efforts to stay ahead of the smartphone market. Following the launch of the iPhone 12 and the latest 5G technology, the Zhengzhou plant will play a significant role in the production of these devices, and help ensure that Apple maintains a stable innovation flow. Foxconn China's decision to open a factory in Zhengzhou also demonstrates the company's commitment to Henan Province, as it has invested more than $8 billion in the region over the past decade. This long-term commitment provides much needed jobs and economic opportunities for Henan, creating a vibrant economy for the region. Foxconn's vision for the Zhengzhou plant includes automation and smart manufacturing, which will further increase capacity using cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence and robotics. The complex is already equipped with advanced robotic technology and automated production systems that can significantly improve efficiency and reduce the need for manual labor. The Zhengzhou plant is the latest example of Foxconn China's commitment to using its resources to produce the most advanced products in the world. By investing in the best technology and working closely with customers, Foxconn China ensures that Apple's products remain one of the most popular products on the planet.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".. McCarthy's rise to the most powerful position in Congress is surprising and controversial, to say the least: a decade ago, he was an unobtrusive backstage. But since then, he has risen to the top of Republican-and House politics-partly due to his willingness to work for President Donald Trump and his highly publicized political acumen. It is not surprising that McCarthy's rise has been viewed with suspicion by many, including many members of his own party. As Republican Matt Lewis wrote in a widely circulated tweet: \"Assuming the Speaker remains in the majority, the House will be more like McCarthy than anyone else for decades.\" This general concern has led McCarthy to be widely described as an opportunistic wheel businessman with no real ideology or theory of governance other than increasing his own power. Of course, this fear is understandable, and McCarthy's critics have a point: His political approach seems more tactical than grand ideological vision. But it's also worth considering that McCarthy's critics may have misunderstood him and what it means to be a successful speaker in the House of Representatives, whose role is to organize and lead the House, and become the public face of the institution. Therefore, to solve problems, compromises and agreements are often required. This is not to say that McCarthy's critics are wrong - one can understand why, given his track record, some would find his rise in the role of speaker unsettling. But it's worth considering that McCarthy's political acumen - and his ability to work with different members of Congress and get things done - may be what makes him fit for the job. McCarthy's critics may have missed something else: a realistic alternative. Despite all the concerns about McCarthy's rise to the speech role, who is even on the short list of competitors? No group of high-quality, ideologically consistent alternatives are waiting for McCarthy's wings. Thus, McCarthy's critics should at least admit that he is a clever political operator - even if they disagree with his overall political approach. Perhaps more importantly, they should consider what a better alternative might look like. But his critics should think carefully about what kind of alternative they want and how best to achieve it. It is also clear that McCarthy has the opportunity to become the first Republican speaker in nearly a decade, and for his critics to come up with a theory of reality that can rival his own government.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The olive garden parent company Darden Restaurants Inc reported a stronger quarterly profit than expected on Wednesday as customers returned to the restaurant for dinner, with new security protocols bringing customers back. The company's optimistic outlook saw its shares rise nearly 5 percent in pre-sale trading. In the fourth quarter ending November 29, Daden reported earnings per share of $1.41, more than anticipated at $1.37. Revenue grew by 5.9% to $2.54 billion, also exceeding forecasted at $2.52 billion. Compared to the same period a year ago, Olive Garden sales increased by 6.7%, thanks to an increase in co-store sales of 3.2%. Other Darden chains, including LongHorn Steakhouse and Ceddar's Scratch Kitchen, also grew by 2.6%. Even as the pandemic continues to stifle consumer spending, the company's sales in established locations are growing.Darden attributes its success to its security measures, including expanding pickup and delivery options and improving customer service. \"In this unprecedented environment, our team has demonstrated their extraordinary resilience, motivation and focus on providing a safe and enjoyable experience for our guests,\" CEO Jean Lee said in a statement. The company also raised its outlook for fiscal 2021, expecting adjusted earnings per share to increase by 6% to 8%, compared with previous forecasts of 2% to 4%. Daden was one of the first major chain restaurants to report revenue during a period when the pandemic caused dramatic fluctuations in restaurant traffic. In the United States, sales of casual restaurants fell 26.2% in November due to tighter indoor dining restrictions and cold weather keeping people at home. Nevertheless, some regions, including the Midwest, reported high demand for casual restaurants. Daden's ability to navigate the turmoil caused by the pandemic sets it apart from smaller competitors. The company cut costs by closing down poorly performing locations and suspending its dividend payments, and invested heavily in outdoor dining services including delivery and delivery. The company said it expects sales in 2021 to continue to be challenged by the outbreak, but believes it can succeed by focusing on security and executing its strategy. \"We are on track to resume positive sales growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and have confidence in our ability to achieve positive adjusted earnings growth throughout the year,\" Li said. Since the report's release, Darden's share price has risen 4.8% to $118.86 in pre-sale trading. The stock has so far gained 7% this year, while the S&P 500 index rose 3.2%.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".. In times of unprecedented social and political turmoil, our country and the world have become increasingly dependent on the opinions and insights of scholars, especially historians. As public intellectuals rise, popular culture has also increasingly adopted the views of historians to shape debates, inform discussions, explain the present, and provide advice for the future. Historians tend to rely too much on certain ideas and stories, leading to narrow narratives that ignore important nuances and context. Here are five things historians often say - and how to think more deeply about the problems we face. 1. \"We can learn from the past\" The more nuanced explanation for this idea is that history can provide us with insights and perspectives, but often without \"correct\" answers. Moreover, certain moments in history are better sources of insight than others, because some lessons may be more applicable to contemporary problems. 2. \"It was different then.\" For example, when discussing the legacy of slavery, one might say that slavery in the 19th century was just a different system from today's. Although slavery has changed over the years, it is important to note that past atrocities are still as significant or serious today. 3. \"It's just the way things are.\" While many problems have been around for centuries, it is important to recognize that they manifest themselves today in a very different way from the past. Moreover, not all of them emerged centuries ago - and new ones emerging in recent decades have had an impact on our contemporary lives. 4. \"They don't know anything better\" This phrase is often used to avoid criticism of those who have lived in the past, and to avoid applying current standards to past behavior. While it's true that people in the past don't know what we know now, they do know something - and certainly someone in the past could have had a broader, more enlightened view. \"History repeats itself\" While some patterns in history do repeat over time, it's important to recognize that history doesn't have to be repeated - there is the potential for us to learn from our mistakes and shape the future. The best way to prevent a recurrence of history is to actively work to break these cycles and open up new paths forward. The above five sentences are just a few examples of how historians sometimes struggle to provide meaningful insights into contemporary events. In this turbulent era, our world is in urgent need of new analysis and ideas - finding ways to break past patterns and bring about positive, meaningful change.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".. It's a new year, and many Americans want the old one to stay behind us - and soon. That's why some have called for the release of four celebrities they call the worst players of 2020 - President Donald Trump, SpaceX and Tesla boss Elon Musk, said singer Carney West and actor Johnny Depp. The social media campaign #byebyebadguys has gained attention as more and more people join in calling for the four to leave the scene forever. For four years, Donald Trump has dominated the headlines as he struggles to reduce environmental protection, appoint conservative Supreme Court judges, embrace a love of executive orders, and issue insults to world leaders. For his fans, his triumphant rhetoric and strong convictions about immigration and trade are a breath of fresh air, while for his commentators they represent a dangerous flirt, white supremacy, xenophobia and rejection of the truth. He and his space exploration company, SpaceX, have brought the long-term dream of commercial space flight closer to reality. But an industry partnership between Musk and governments in many countries whose policies are deemed dangerous and unethical, including China, Israel, and the United Arab Emirates, has marginalized the world, while his carbon-intensive business is having a serious impact on the environment. Popular rapper and fashion designer Kanye West has been seen in some circles as an idiot because of his strong support for Trump and his declared presidential ambitions. But with the epidemic causing pain and suffering to communities of color, West became news by high-profile refusal to wear masks and allegedly refusing to pay rent on its Carabasas farm. The news cycle was dramatic when Johnny Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard competed in a fierce legal battle over alleged domestic abuse. Domestic violence allegations were a turning point, and many of Depp's celebrity and non-celebrity fans also called for him to be blacklisted. Now, many are tired of these four people's funny moves and want to see a release from their attention-taking behavior. The #byebyebadguys label has been used by celebrities and non-celebrity to send a clear message to people they think are bad actors. \"It's time for 2020 to end, and our nightmare of 2020 is over,\" one user wrote. \"I'm done, I won't miss any of the roles in 2021. We deserve better!\" added another. The label also inspired a series of art, music and meme projects. One user shared four \"imaginary\" drawings that were launched into outer space with the slogan \"#byebyebadguys\". However, it remains to be seen how much impact this sentiment will have. Donald Trump is struggling with his election defeat and may see himself still in the public eye for some time to come. Elon Musk, well-funded, continues to shape the world's process of technology and space exploration. But at least some people seem determined to express their dissatisfaction - and will certainly be watching closely to see if the four would accept the hint.", "label": "machine"}

It said the park has seen an increase in people arriving by boat from Cuba.\n\n\"The closure, which is expected to last several days, is necessary for the safety of visitors and staff because of the resources and space needed to attend to the migrants,\" the NPS said.\n\nFirst responders at the park are providing food, water and basic medical needs until the Department of Homeland Security arrives, the statement noted.

Migrants can be seen leaping off their makeshift chug boats, hugging each other, and cheering with joy after making it to land. He told NPR member station WGCU that the migrants' supplies included life vests and bags of crackers.\n\nAbout 70 miles west of Key West, Fla., the 100-square mile park consists of seven small islands accessible only by boat or seaplane.

You play as a man who dies and comes back to life to use his skills playing cards to help his horse win races. It sounds absurd and it is. But it\u2019s also brilliant, showing Game Freak knows its way around more than just iterating on Pok\u00e9mon sequels.\n\nApple announced the port to iOS, called Ride On!, on Tuesday, and while the gameplay will remain the same, the horse races themselves will now be portrayed in 3D.

Why would Game Freak, the studio continually pumping out new Pok\u00e9mon best-sellers, take time to ship a $7 micro-game?\n\nThe studio has an internal system called the \u201cGear Project\u201d where employees form teams and submit game projects. The approved ones then get greenlit for full development. Besides Pocket Card Jockey, games like HarmoKnight, Tembo The Badass Elephant, and Giga Wrecker were also born of this process.

{"text": "It's time to start treating handbags like a legitimate investment. In 2020, the investment potential of handbags outpaced rare artwork, cars and whiskey, according to Art Market Research. By 2027, the market is expected to reach $100 billion, compared to today's $72 billion. As the founder of Rebag, a designer handbag resale site, I've kept a close eye on the resale value of sought-after luxury goods. Based on our proprietary pricing tool, which uses millions of data points on primary and secondary market pricing and demand, here are six designer handbags that are actually worth the money \u2014 and the ones you may regret buying:\n\n1. Telfar bags\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Telfar Shopping Bag Photo: Rebag\n\nThanks to high demand, limited drops and celebrity fans like Dua Lipa, Oprah Winfrey and Beyonc\u00e9, Telfar bags have an average value retention of 195%, meaning that they appreciate to nearly twice as much as their original retail price. That's well above other major designer names \u2014 like Chanel, for example, which boasts an average value retention of 87%. Founded in 2005 by Telfar Clemens, any model of the Telfar Shopping Bag, especially the Ugg, Eastpak and Moose Knuckles collaborations, will earn at least its retail value at resale.\n\n2. Herm\u00e8s bags\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Herm\u00e8s Birkin Sellier Photo: Rebag\n\nLike Telfar, Herm\u00e8s is a designer \"unicorn.\" On average, the brand's products retain their initial retail value and are worth more on the resale market. The French luxury brand has an average value retention of 103%. The Birkin and Kelly bags \u2014 named after Jane Birkin and Grace Kelly \u2014 do especially well at resale because they are two of Herm\u00e8s' marquee items. Birkins have an average value retention of 96%, while the Kelly averages 108%. The rare Birkin Sellier has an especially high average value retention of 226%.\n\n3. Louis Vuitton bags\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Louis Vuitton x NBA Ball in Basket Bag Photo: Rebag\n\nAnother designer \"unicorn,\" Louis Vuitton boasts some impressive resale values, especially on their short-release styles. For example, the Nigo Keepall Bandouli\u00e8re bag has a 119% average value retention, while the Louis Vuitton x NBA Ball in Basket Bag has a 147% average value retention. The brand's average retention value at resale is 92%.\n\n4. Chanel bags\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Chanel Deauville Tote Photo: Rebag\n\nThe resale value of Chanel bags climbed with its primary market price increases. Up 12 percentage points from 2021, the brand's average value retention is 87%, although several bags exceed 100%. Chanel's Deauville Tote and Grand Shopping Tote are among the highest-value bags, retaining an average of 112% and 110%, respectively, of their values on the secondary market.\n\n5. Mini editions\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Louis Vuitton Mini Speedy Photo: Rebag\n\nMini editions are excellent investments because they are produced in smaller quantities and have high demand, often driving their secondary market values up. For example, the Louis Vuitton Speedy Mini HL Handbag retains 201% of its value at resale, while a vintage Fendi Micro Baguette keeps 149% of its retail value on the secondary market.\n\n6. Collaborations\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Dior Daniel Arsham Double Zip Crossbody Pouch Photo: Rebag\n\nCollaborations are excellent investments because they're limited editions that often sell out. The Balenciaga and Gucci Hacker Project tote has a 122% average value retention, while The Hacker Project camera bag holds 116% of its initial retail value at resale.

{"text": "In recent years, the U.S. economy has experienced a difficult period of slowing growth and rising unemployment. But despite economic headwinds, some sectors of the market have remained relatively stable - one of which is the financial sector. In the first quarter of 2021, the sector grew by 5.3%, while the broader S&P 500 index fell by 4.3%. The financial sector also outperformed the broad S&P 500 Index with an increase of 6.2% year-on-year, up 3.8% from the overall index. Analysts attribute the resilience of the financial industry to its extensive exposure to the U.S. economy. It includes banking, insurance and asset management industries that are resilient despite economic uncertainty. \"The financial industry is in a unique position to benefit from the U.S. economic recovery,\" said Adam Sharp, senior analyst at The Half Time Report. \"The sector has had far-reaching impacts across multiple sectors ranging from banking and investment services to real estate. This diverse exposure allows financial firms to remain resilient even in the face of downturns.\" This is good news for investors, because the financial sector can provide a degree of stability in volatile markets. Moreover, with the Fed's current monetary policy stance, interest rates may remain low, which could benefit financial firms heavily dependent on interest income. \"In addition to the industry's exposure to diversification, low interest rates also contribute to improving the profitability of financial companies,\" Sharp said. \"Even if economic growth remains slow, the profitability of the sector may remain strong.\" Analysts are also optimistic about the sector, as it is exposed to emerging markets. Many of the world's largest financial firms have significant presence in emerging markets, which could benefit from improved economic conditions. \"It is expected that emerging markets will see strong growth in the coming years, and many financial companies are expected to benefit from this growth,\" Sharp said. \"Despite current economic uncertainties, the long-term outlook for the sector remains bright.\" Overall, despite continued economic uncertainty, the financial sector appears to be on track to continue performing well in the short term. Thanks to its extensive exposure to the U.S. economy and long-term outlook, the sector will continue to maintain a stable stock market performance even during recessions.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "According to industry analysts and executives, automakers are cautiously optimistic about the rally in 2023, which is the worst new car sales in more than a decade. U.S. new car sales fell 14 percent in 2022 - the worst year since 2011 - and were particularly hard hit in the fourth quarter. But analysts say the industry is showing signs of stability, and could see a rebound in the coming year. \"As we look ahead to 2023, we are cautiously optimistic about the outlook for the industry,\" said Jeremy Acevedo, Edmunds' Industry Analyst Manager. \"We see some stability factors, from incentives to inventory levels, that could have a positive impact on the industry this year.\" Key factors pointing to a rebound in 2023 include increased consumer confidence, an increase in rental activity and the need for prepayments from buyers who delayed purchases due to the 2020 and 2021 pandemic. At the same time, there are still uncertainties that could have a negative impact on the industry, including higher inflation and interest rates, disruptions in supply chains, and possible declines in overall demand. In 2020, sales fell by 16%, and the industry only partially recovered in 2021. But analysts say that 2023 may be a different story. \"We are cautiously optimistic that there will be some kind of recovery in 2023,\" said Acevedo. \"Automakers have done a good job recovering from the pandemic, but we still see some lag effects that could affect the industry in the coming year.\" Analysts say the most likely scenario is a slight increase in sales in 2023 - about 3% to 5%. That's enough to help the industry recover some of its losses from the past two years, but still far short of pre-epidemic strength. \"The recovery we're seeing is a bit tedious,\" said Karl Brauer, executive publisher of KBB.com and AutoTrader. \"We don't expect any large-scale sales growth, but if the situation remains relatively stable, it should be enough to put the industry back on track.\" The good news is that there are several factors that can help drive the industry in the right direction in 2023. As buyers become more comfortable with the idea of buying a new car, demand for rental cars will likely pick up. And automakers may also offer incentives to attract buyers into showrooms. \"We're seeing signs that automakers are becoming more aggressive in the incentive space,\" Acevedo said, \"which could help stimulate sales over the next year.\" Acevedo said that the rental market could also be a positive for the industry. Rental activity fell to its lowest point since 2014 in 2020, but has been slowly rebounding in recent months. \"The rental market may be one of the factors that will help the automotive industry in 2023,\" he said. \"It can help stimulate demand for new cars, which is good for everyone.\" Overall, analysts say there is reason to be optimistic about the industry in 2023. \"We're still feeling some of the impact of the pandemic, but we're starting to see more positive signs that could lead to a stronger recovery in the coming year,\" Brauer said. \"There are still some challenges ahead, but the industry should be in a better position in 2023.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": ".. Former Twitter employees are suing the tech giant for claiming that it was a \"inhuman and clumsy\" layoff process orchestrated by CEO Elon Musk. The lawsuit, aimed at seeking class action status, has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. According to court documents, the lawsuit alleges that Musk and Twitter suddenly fired more than 300 employees in October and December 2020, in violation of federal and state laws. The lawsuit alleges that Twitter violated WARN Act, which requires companies to give 60 days notice to major layoffs, and that Twitter failed to negotiate with workers' collective bargaining representatives who were laid off, according to court documents. The lawsuit also alleged that Musk and Twitter executives deliberately tried to \"avoid the attention of the public, media and their own employees\" as they carried out layoffs and failed to notify affected employees in a \"timely and effective manner.\" \"Twitter's way of firing employees is cold and unrelenting, completely ignoring its impact on their livelihood,\" said former Twitter employee Maddy Lord, who was the main plaintiff in the lawsuit. \"My former colleagues and I are standing up to defend our rights, demanding what wages and benefits we deserve, and making sure that doesn't happen again.\" Other former employees who were part of the lawsuit also responded to Lord's sentiment and criticized the tech giant for handling the termination. \"Twitter's dismissal of our colleagues is clumsy and inhuman,\" said David Nunez, a former Twitter employee who was also the main plaintiff in the case. \"At such a chaotic time, the company failed to provide us with the necessary notice, guidance or resources that we as employees deserve.\" The lawsuit also alleges that Twitter did not inform employees of their rights to receive termination payments, health insurance benefits and placement services. The plaintiff further claims that Twitter told leaving employees that they were prohibited from discussing their dismissal with anyone, in violation of California law. In response to the lawsuit, Twitter said it \"disagrees\" with claims filed by former employees but will \"continue to assess the case and respond as appropriate\". Tesla's chief executive has been accused of operating overly aggressive workplaces and creating a hostile environment for employees. In recent weeks, there have been reports of massive layoffs and other sudden shifts in personnel at the company. With this lawsuit, former employees of Twitter hope that the tech giant will ultimately be held accountable for its dismissal. They also want to set a precedent for how the company behaved during the layoffs. \"We stand up to make sure companies like Twitter respect their employees,\" said Nunes, \"and if we succeed in this lawsuit, it could be a wake-up call for other companies before they deal with the layoffs in such a clumsy and inhuman way.\"", "label": "machine"}

The Bankman-Fried-founded hedge fund, Alameda Research, donated more than $5 million to Future Forward USA, which went on to spend millions backing Joe Biden's 2020 candidacy for president. Those PACs did not respond to requests to comment on whether they would return the contributions.\n\nBankman-Fried also donated $6 million in April to House Majority PAC, which raises money for Democratic candidates running for the lower chamber, according to an FEC filing.

Singh donated $8 million to federal campaigns during the 2022 midterms. The former FTX director of engineering has not been charged with any crimes.\n\nThe PAC is returning the donations after Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas and is facing charges by U.S. federal prosecutors, as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Prosecutors charged Bankman-Fried with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud, among other allegations.\n\nHe was also charged with violating campaign finance laws, including allegations that he gave at least $25,000 to campaigns and political action committees \"in the names of other persons.\"\n\nBankman-Fried diverted customer assets held by FTX, a major cryptocurrency exchange, to his separate crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research, the SEC said in its complaint.

{"text": "On Tuesday, Cameron Winklevoss, chief executive of cryptocurrency trading firm Gemini, launched a heated rhetorical battle with Michael Moro, head of rival Genesis Global Trading, accusing him of delaying the return of $900 million to customers. The conflict between Winklevoss and Moro began last week when Winklevoss accused Genesis of standing still in returning funds to customers who invested in its cryptocurrency services. Genesis subsequently responded that Winklevoss had carried out a \"defamation campaign\" against their company. Now Winklevoss is raising the premise, accusing Moro of deliberately delaying the return of funds and engaging in \"despicable\" behavior. In an open letter posted on Twitter, Winklevoss said he was \"disgusted\" by the way that Moro dealt with this situation. Winklevoss writes: \"You refuse to return nearly $900 million to customers and explain in detail why it is necessary, which is despicable and reflects your true character.\" By refusing to do so, you send a clear message to investors around the world that you don't care about their money at all. The dispute between Winklevoss and Moreau focused on the return of funds to customers who had been stuck after Genesis closed its trading platform last week due to \"liquidity issues.\" When the company shut down, $900 million in customer funds were frozen, leaving many unable to access their funds. The controversy has led to a long and fierce competition between Winklevos and Moro, who accuse the former of running \"dumping\" scams while the latter calls on the former to create \"stigmatized activities.\" Winklevoss said in the letter that he is willing to work with Moro to resolve this issue, but only if Moro is willing to explain why the platform was shut down and what steps are being taken to ensure customers aren't left in their pockets. \"I strongly urge you to stop making excuses, start taking responsibility for what happened and restore lost trust,\" Winklefts wrote. At the time of writing, Moro did not respond to Winklevoss' letter. However, the escalating controversy has raised concerns about the tension between the two and their company's approach to customer service. The conflict between Gemini and Genesis over the freezing of funds could have serious implications for the industry, especially if customers are not able to get their full return on investment. This could lead to increased scrutiny by regulators who have been paying close attention to signs of fraud or abuse in the cryptocurrency industry. The debate also highlights the often intense competition between Gemini and Genesis, both of which have been competing for market share since their inception in 2020. Both companies are accused of engaging in strategies aimed at gaining an edge, including cutting costs and offering lucrative referral bonuses. It remains to be seen how the dispute will be resolved, but it has shown that the competition between Gemini and Genesis is more than just words; customer service will be a key factor in deciding which company wins.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "London CNN Business \u2014\n\nGlobal fossil fuel emissions are expected to peak in 2025 as countries commit huge sums of money toward low-carbon fuels, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\nIn its annual World Energy Outlook report, published Thursday, the agency said that Russia\u2019s assault on Ukraine had the potential to \u201chasten\u201d the global transition to clean energy sources.\n\nThe IEA said it expects global investments in low-carbon energy to increase to $2 trillion a year until the end of the decade \u2014 up 50% from today\u2019s spending.\n\n\u201cEnergy markets and policies have changed as a result of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, not just for the time being, but for decades to come,\u201d Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, said in the report.\n\n\u201cGovernment responses around the world promise to make this a historic and definitive turning point towards a cleaner, more affordable and more secure energy system,\u201d he added.\n\nSince the war broke out in late February, many countries have shunned Russia\u2019s vast energy exports, finding new suppliers and ramping up imports of alternate energy sources.\n\nThat has put Moscow in a \u201cmuch-diminished position,\u201d the IEA said, and Russia is on course for its share of global energy exports drop to 13% by 2030 from 20% last year.\n\nEurope \u2014 Moscow\u2019s biggest customer for oil and gas \u2014 has borne the brunt of the energy crunch. Benchmark natural gas prices have shot up since the invasion, though have dropped steeply in recent weeks thanks to mild temperatures and the bloc\u2019s successful efforts to store gas for winter.\n\n\u201cRussia [has] lost this market forever. And it will be very difficult [for] this Russian oil and gas [to] find a new home as big as Europe, as lucrative as Europe,\u201d Birol told CNN\u2019s Julia Chatterley in an interview on Thursday.\n\nEarlier this week, Birol said that intense competition for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and cuts in oil output by OPEC and its allies had led to \u201cthe first truly global energy crisis,\u201d according to a Reuters.\n\nThursday\u2019s report will be welcomed by those who\u2019ve worried that the crisis has set the world\u2019s climate goals back.\n\nFears of energy shortages have led some countries in Europe and China to burn more coal this year. Hard coal power generation jumped nearly 15% between March and September in Europe in 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, according to the Independent Commodity Intelligence Services.\n\nOverall, though, growth in coal burning has been \u201cmuted\u201d this year, Birol told CNN.\n\nAnd, for the first time ever, the IEA\u2019s annual forecast sees demand for all fossil fuel to either peak or plateau. Oil is expected to be the last holdout, reaching a plateau by the mid-2030s, the report said.\n\n\u201cGovernments are putting real money on the table to accelerate the green energy [transition], not necessarily for environmental, climate reasons, but mainly for energy security reasons,\u201d Birol told CNN.\n\nDespite the flurry of clean energy investment, the agency said that it expects global temperatures to rise by 2.5 Celsius (4.5 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century \u2014 well above the 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) upper limit needed to avert severe consequences for the climate. The world has already warmed 1.2 degrees Celsius since the industrial revolution.\n\nGovernments will also need to raise their annual clean energy investments to $4 trillion by 2030 to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, the report said.\n\n\u201cThere is still a large gap between today\u2019s pledges and a stabilization of the rise in global temperatures around 1.5\u00b0C,\u201d the IEA warned.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "A British mother was fined PS1,700 (US$2,300) after reportedly asking her son's employer if he could find a job by donating part of his liver to him. The incident occurred in October 2020, when the still unnamed 53-year-old mother contacted a London liver transplant clinic and asked if her son had a chance to become an employee if she donated part of his liver to him. At that time, the mother's son had applied for several jobs, but none were successful. The transplant clinic immediately reported the mother to the UK health care regulator's Care Quality Committee (CQC) and found that she had violated patient confidentiality rules. The regulator fined the mother PS1,700 for her actions, which reportedly included a suggestion that her son might receive preferential treatment. This is the first time in Britain that someone has been fined for such an incident, which is believed to be a warning to others who may have had the same temptation. The CQC also made clear that the woman's behavior was inappropriate, as it could put her son in a vulnerable position and possibly exert unnecessary pressure on the transplant center. The mother later accepted the fine and apologized for her actions, saying she desperately wanted to help her son find a job. She told reporters: \"I understand why I was fined, and I accept that. I just want to help my son find work, and think if I donate a portion of my liver, it might make a difference. I realize now that this is wrong, I'm sorry.\" The incident underscores the harsh reality of the UK job market and the price that some people are willing to pay in order to secure employment. While the mother's desire to help her son is commendable, her actions are wrong and should not be repeated. For individuals, it's important to remember that CQC exists to ensure the safety of patients and that appropriate action will be taken if any violations occur. CQC urges employers to understand their obligations to potential employees and their rights when considering job applications. In addition, individuals should not attempt to place themselves in a vulnerable position by obtaining work through unethical means. CQC is committed to ensuring that employers treat all applicants fairly and without discrimination, and encourages anyone who believes they have experienced such behavior to report it. The event also highlights the importance of understanding the ethics of transplantation, which is critical to ensuring that all transplant decisions are based on fairness and equality.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "It should be another good year for energy stocks, according to Goldman Sachs. The sector outperformed the S & P 500 by 78% in 2022, and while it is unlikely there will be a repeat of that magnitude, the backdrop is still constructive for energy equities, analyst Neil Mehta said in a note Tuesday. \"We see Brent in a multi-year $80-$100/b range (above the forward curve), the equities 'sweet spot' and see company-specific drivers around capital returns, project developments and execution to drive healthy upside/downside dispersion,\" he wrote. XLE 1Y mountain Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund's strong performance Goldman's bottom-up price targets imply 13% market cap weighted total return to the energy stocks it covers. The firm's buy-rated stocks have an implied 26% average total return. Investors should keep their eye on pullbacks in the space, Mehta said. There were three in both 2021 and 2022, and he said he would not be surprised if there is a similar frequency this year. \"That said, each pullback created an attractive entry point for investors who may have missed the early innings of the rally,\" he wrote. Of the stocks Goldman rates a buy, several have upside north of 40% to the firm's price targets. Here are 10 names on its buy list. The stocks with the highest total return are Antero Resources and Cheniere Energy , both at 48%, according to Goldman Sachs. Antero Resources gained a whopping 77% in 2022 and was down nearly 9% so far this year. Natural gas exporter Cheniere Energy gained nearly 28% in 2022, but so far is down around 5% since the start of the year. Cheniere was also named a top conviction pick for 2023 by UBS in December, thanks to its exposure to the undersupplied liquid natural gas industry. Meanwhile, energy services will offer the best earnings per share growth in 2023, Mehta said. In this space, he likes SLB , Halliburton and, especially, Baker Hughes . \"Given sharp performance, risk/reward looks particularly compelling for BKR from current levels as we move into 2023,\" he wrote. Baker Hughes gained nearly 23% last year. Among the supermajors, Mehta prefers Exxon Mobil and Conocophillips over Chevron .

{"text": "CNN has announced that it has laid off hundreds of employees following a business review of its operations. These layoffs come after a year of economic losses to the news network, which has struggled to compete in an increasingly competitive media environment. CNN President Jeff Zucker sent a memo to staff Friday announcing the news. \"Over the past few months, we have carefully reviewed our business as part of a comprehensive review of how best to adapt to a rapidly changing environment. We concluded that we need to make some difficult decisions to ensure CNN remains competitive and continues to meet the ever-changing needs of its audience,\" Zucker wrote in his memo. \"After careful consideration and thorough analysis, we have decided to cut a number of positions. This is not an easy decision, but it must be ensured that we are able to continue serving our audiences and succeed in the future. We appreciate the hard work and dedication of those colleagues whose roles were affected,\" he continued. As of 2018, CNN had about 4,000 employees, including editors and producers who were affected by the cuts. According to one person familiar with the matter, the number of positions being abolished was in the hundreds. CNN is also facing fierce competition from Fox News and MSNBC, both of which have higher ratings. In 2020, CNN suffered a significant loss in advertising revenue, with operating revenues expected to fall by $228 million in 2020. In the memo, Zucker stressed that CNN is \"positioning itself to be stronger than ever\" despite layoffs. \"We are not alone in having to make difficult decisions that affect our colleagues. This is an unfortunate reality of the current environment, and we must continue to be vigilant about how we manage our operations to ensure that we remain competitive and serve our audience in the best way possible,\" he wrote. CNN is reportedly providing transition support to affected employees, including access to job search websites, financial planning services and career counseling. In a memo, Zucker also said the company was evaluating how it could retrain and move employees to positions where \"their skills are best suited.\" A number of other media outlets, including BuzzFeed, Vice and Refinery, have cut staff over the past year due to financial pressures. \"We know this is hard to come by, and we thank those who are dedicated to CNN's work and talent,\" said Zach. \"We are committed to being transparent and open with you, and will continue to provide up-to-date information on the state of our business.\"", "label": "machine"}

That is to say, rates are variable and can change multiple times per year at the whim of the Federal Reserve.\n\nIf the interest rate on your savings account changes significantly, you might decide to look at other financial institutions to see if you can find a more competitive interest rate elsewhere. However, bear in mind that changing accounts may not be worth the effort, particularly if your new account's rate drops afterward.\n\nYou also might consider other savings account options. For example, buying savings bonds or setting up a CD ladder may be worth considering if you've already established your emergency fund.\n\nTypical interest rates\n\nNationally, the average traditional savings account earns just 0.30% APY.\n\nIf you're more comfortable banking with a brick-and-mortar bank, a traditional savings account might be a better option for you. Just know that you may not be getting the best possible interest rate, because online banks and credit unions usually offer higher rates.\n\nSavings account basics\n\nA savings account is an interest-earning bank account. Accounts that are backed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) are secure. Up to $250,000 per owner is insured in these bank accounts.\n\nWhat to look for in a savings account\n\nWhen you're looking for a savings account, you'll want to read through the account disclosures and terms to review the account's minimum balance requirements and minimum opening deposits. The account disclosure may also specify any fees associated with the account, and whether there are any transaction limits.\n\nThe best savings account interest rates\n\nGenerally, you'll find the best savings interest rates at online banks. The best high-yield savings accounts offer 3.50% APY or more right now. Right now, UFB Direct offers the highest interest rate on our list. UFB Best Savings pays 4.11% (as of 12/14/2022) APY.\n\nSavings account fees\n\nDepending on where you bank, some savings accounts may charge monthly service fees. A monthly service fee is an amount you'll have to pay each month to maintain an account. Some accounts will allow you to waive a monthly service fee if you meet certain requirements while others cannot be waived.\n\nBear in mind, some savings accounts do not charge certain fees at all. For example, all the banks on our list do not charge any monthly service fees.\n\nHow savings accounts work\n\nA savings account is a type of interest-earning bank account. A savings account rate is variable, which means it can fluctuate after you've opened the account. Your bank will usually email you to tell you the rate will go up or down soon.\n\nSavings accounts may also have transfer limits, according to federal rule Regulation D. Generally, if a savings account has a transfer limit, this means that you'll only be permitted to make six transfers from the account each month. If you exceed the transfer limit, you will have to pay a fee for each additional transfer.\n\nThe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve has recently amended Regulation D, so banks may choose to suspend the monthly transfer limit so customers can make unlimited monthly transactions, or they could enforce a six-per-month limit.\n\nThe different types of savings accounts\n\nThere are six types of savings accounts: traditional savings accounts, high-yield savings accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit, cash management accounts, and specialty savings accounts. The best savings account for you may depend on your banking preference, goals, and when you'll need to access your money.\n\nA high-yield savings account, for example, is a strong choice if you're comfortable with banking digitally and want to earn a high interest rate.\n\nSavings account glossary\n\nBelow is an overview of all the terms you may need to know about savings accounts:\n\nAnnual Percentage Yield (APY): the rate of return you earn over a year on deposit accounts.\n\nthe rate of return you earn over a year on deposit accounts. FDIC insurance: If your bank says it's FDIC insured this means the money in your bank will be secure in the rare event a bank shuts down. Banks can insure up to $250,000 in individual accounts or $500,000 for joint accounts.\n\nIf your bank says it's FDIC insured this means the money in your bank will be secure in the rare event a bank shuts down. Banks can insure up to $250,000 in individual accounts or $500,000 for joint accounts. NCUA insurance: If your credit union says it's federally insured by the NCUA, this means your credit union is secure in the rate event it shuts down. Credit unions are similar to banks, insuring up to $250,000 in individual accounts or $500,000 for joint accounts.\n\nIf your credit union says it's federally insured by the NCUA, this means your credit union is secure in the rate event it shuts down.

We understand that \"best\" is often subjective, so in addition to highlighting the clear benefits of a financial product or account \u2014 a high APY, for example \u2014 we outline the limitations, too. We spent hours comparing and contrasting the features and fine print of various products so you don't have to.\n\nMethodology: About our experts\n\nThere are a lot of high-yield savings accounts out there. Through our research, we've found that the best high-yield savings accounts are offered by banks with a strong online presence, robo-advisors, and other internet-only financial companies.\n\nEach week, we review high-yield savings accounts at nearly two dozen institutions to identify the strongest options. We also cross-reference our list against popular comparison sites like Bankrate and NerdWallet to make sure we don't miss a thing.\n\nWhile interest rates are an important aspect of any high-yield savings account, we also consider minimum deposits and balance requirements, transfer limitations, and any other standout features. Most importantly, we don't consider any high-yield savings accounts that impose monthly maintenance fees.\n\nWe consulted banking and financial planning experts to inform these picks and provide their advice on finding the best high-yield savings accounts for your needs.\n\nInsider\n\nHere's what they had to say about high-yield savings. (Some text may be lightly edited for clarity.)\n\nExpert advice on choosing the best high-yield savings account for you\n\nGenerally, what makes a high-yield savings account good or not good?\n\nRoger Ma, CFP:\n\n\"It might not be as seamless to get your money out of an online savings account as it is a brick-and-mortar, but you don't want to have so much friction where it's such a pain to get the money out when you need it.\"\n\nMykail James, CFEI:\n\n\"Anything with a fee is not a good high-yield savings account. Anything that restricts how much you can save is, to me, not very good. If I can't save more than $10,000 in this account, and then I have to move it over somewhere else \u2014 to me, that's not a really good savings account, because it's not really prepared to help me expand and grow, which is what a savings account is supposed to do. I also look at interest rates, definitely. I look to see when the interest is paid. Is it quarterly, or is it monthly? How often do they pay out interest, and what are the interest rate stipulations?\"\n\nHow should someone decide whether to put their money in a high-yield savings account, money market account, or CD?\n\nTania Brown, CFP:\n\n\"So I guess we'll start off with how much money you want to put in and ... the level of transactions you want to have. If you want to have any transactions, that automatically takes out CDs. Then you're stuck between the high-yield savings and the money market account.\"\n\nLaura Grace Tarpley, Personal Finance Insider:\n\n\"I would use a high-yield savings account or money market account for short-term goals or an emergency fund. You'll probably want to choose whichever has a higher rate, but money market accounts can be good for emergency savings because they often come with a debit card or paper checks, making it easy to access money quickly. Then use CDs for longer-term goals, like buying a home in a few years.\"\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nShould I have multiple savings accounts? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Savings accounts are free to open and to maintain, so there's no real downside to having more than one. In fact, experts often recommend assigning a savings account to a single goal \u2014 house, car, wedding \u2014 so it's always clear how much you have for a given goal, and you aren't tempted to use money meant for one goal to pay for another. Opening multiple accounts at the same bank means they'll always show up in the same place and require the same login credentials. Some banks offer products to mimic this setup without technically opening multiple accounts \u2014 Ally, for instance, offers savings \"buckets\" to keep your money straight. Remember that savings accounts are only one part of your overall financial portfolio. Checking accounts, brokerage accounts, retirement accounts, and college savings accounts all serve different and important purposes for your money.\n\nDo I have to pay taxes on interest earned from a savings account? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Yes, you have to pay taxes on the interest earned from a savings account. If you earn more than $10 in interest on your savings account, the bank holding your account will send you a Form 1099-T to include in your tax return. This is one reason why you shouldn't keep retirement savings in a savings account \u2014 IRAs and 401(k)s, accounts designated for retirement, are tax-advantaged and will help minimize taxes over time.\n\nHow do I withdraw money from my savings account? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Typically, you can withdraw money from your savings account by phone, in person (if your bank has physical locations), via ATM, or by cashier's check \u2014 but doing your transaction online is usually easier. Money kept in your savings account is considered to be easily accessible, or \"liquid,\" because it isn't invested in the market. That means you can move money more easily than you could from a brokerage account. To withdraw money from your savings account: Use your username and password to log into your bank's website or mobile app\n\nNavigate to \"transfers\" (menu options will vary between banks)\n\nSpecify which account you want to withdraw from, and the checking account where you want the money to go\n\nConfirm the transaction when prompted If your checking and savings accounts are at the same bank, it should transfer more quickly than if you're moving money between banks. If you're moving money between banks, expect it to take at least one business day. Remember that savings accounts are designed for saving, not spending, and some banks may charge a fee for too many withdrawals in a given time frame. The easiest way to make regular withdrawals is to move your money into an account that exists for this purpose, like a checking account. Or, if you expect to take money from savings regularly, consider a hybrid checking and savings account like the one offered by SoFi.\n\nCan I set up direct deposit for my savings account? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Yes, you can set up direct deposit to your savings account. You can typically have your paycheck, or a portion of your paycheck, deposited directly into savings, or you can set up recurring automatic deposits from checking into savings. To do this, you can call or visit a branch (if your bank has physical locations) or log into your bank's website or app.\n\nDoes the interest rate on my savings account change? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Yes, the interest rate on your savings account will most likely change. Interest rates on savings accounts are variable, meaning they can and will change regularly and without advance notice. These fluctuations are based on the federal funds rate, which is set by the Federal Reserve. Because interest rates are variable, it might seem tempting to open multiple accounts and shuffle your money between them according to which has the best interest rate at any given time. You're allowed to do this, but we don't recommend it simply because of the maintenance and attention it requires. You're just as well off choosing a high-yield savings account that meets your needs, setting up automatic deposits, and leaving it alone to grow over time.\n\nDoes my savings account help me build credit? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. No, your savings account doesn't help you build credit. Credit shows banks and lenders whether they can trust you to pay back a loan, based on your past behavior. You build credit by borrowing money and paying it back on time, whether that's money borrowed through a credit card, a personal loan, a student loan, a car loan, or a mortgage. The more positive borrowing behavior you demonstrate, the more your credit score should rise.\n\nDo I have enough savings? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Experts typically recommend having about three to six months' worth of expenses in a savings account as an emergency fund, to be used only in case of emergency like job loss or a medical event. This estimate varies based on individual factors (Is there another income in your household? Do you have significant debt?) but it's a good rule of thumb. However, \"enough\" savings will be different for everyone, depending on your goals, financial obligations, and life stage. Remember that retirement savings and any investments \u2014 important parts of your overall portfolio \u2014 will not be stored in a savings account.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Idaho Falls - Chief Constable Shawn Huffman, a senior law enforcement official in Idaho, regrets the lack of transparency in the early stages of an ongoing investigation into the suspicious death of a 44-year-old woman who was found dead at a hotel in Idaho Falls on Dec. 12. The chief made his remarks in a statement released by the Idaho Falls Police Department, not long before a suspect arrested in Arizona was expected to waive extradition to Idaho later on Friday. \"It's no secret that our investigation has been conducted under a microscope and the review is worth it,\" Hoffman said in a statement. \"I regret that we have failed to provide a level of transparency that the public deserves and expects.\" In recent weeks, the Idaho Falls Police Department has come under fire over a delay in investigating Kathrina Henry's suspicious death. On December 12, Henry was found dead in a hotel room in Idaho Falls and an autopsy confirmed her death as a homicide. The investigation into Henry's death was covered in secrecy, and police declined to reveal information about possible suspects or motives. Last week, the police revealed that they had arrested a suspect in Arizona, but again refused to disclose the name of the suspect or details of his arrest. In his statement, Hoffman said the lack of transparency was due to \"a commitment to ensuring that investigations are handled in a professional, dignified and respectful manner,\" adding that the decision to retain information was also made to avoid jeopardizing investigations and safeguarding the integrity of the judicial process. Hoffman also said he understood \"the public's frustration with the lack of information, and we hope that this statement will provide a degree of transparency in the process.\" We regret that we were not able to share more details before it was announced. In a statement, Hoffman also noted that the department had taken \"all necessary steps\" to investigate Henry's death, including \"interviewing people associated with this investigation, gathering evidence and evaluating physical evidence.\" He also said the department \"worked with outside agencies, including Idaho Police and the FBI, to ensure that all resources were devoted to efforts to successfully resolve this case.\" As part of the ongoing investigation, an Arizona judge on Friday approved a motion to extradite Henry's death suspect to Idaho, where he is expected to face charges. The department will continue to investigate the cause of Henry's death, Hoffman said in a statement, \"We are confident that thorough and professional investigations will lead to a successful prosecution in this case.\" \"As always, Idaho Falls Police Department men and women are committed to the highest integrity and professionalism as citizens of Idaho Falls and serve our justice system,\" he said.", "label": "machine"}

In the wider Lake District national park area, demand dipped 5% compared to the same period, and in mid-Wales it fell 10%.\n\nZoopla defines \"demand\" as emailing or phoning an agent about a home for sale.\n\nIn April 2020, during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, 46.6% of people in employment did some work from home, according to the Office for National Statistics. That figure rose to 57.2% in London, and there was an exodus from bustling urban areas as people sought leafy towns and coastal villages instead.\n\n\"Since the pandemic began in spring 2020, buyers - freed from the daily office commute - have been casting their home-searching nets further afield,\" Zoopla's Executive Director of Research Richard Donnell said in a press release.\n\nMost people who started working from home during the coronavirus pandemic plan to work both at home and in an office going forward, according to the ONS data, and many companies have mandated a return to the workplace, which appears to have caused a pivot in the housing market.\n\n\"The dynamics that have shaped the housing market over the last 5 years are shifting. We expect affordable urban centres to fare better than average in 2023,\" Donnell said.\n\nThe cost-of-living crisis has also contributed to the shift. Apartments are cheaper to run from an energy perspective, and on average, U.K. houses are more than twice the price of an apartment \u2014 the highest in 20 years, according to Zoopla.\n\nUrban areas also tend to offer more employment opportunities.\n\nA tricky environment for buyers\n\nThe Bank of England raised its interest rate to 3.5% on Dec. 15, pushing up borrowing costs for homebuyers. Both two- and five-year fixed mortgage rates have increased by more than 3% during 2022, according to Moneyfacts.co.uk.\n\nThe U.K. mortgage market fell into crisis in September following drastic policy shifts by then-Finance Minister Kwasi Kwarteng.

{"text": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) questions Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chairman Powell during a Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee hearing on the CARES Act, at the Hart Senate Office Building in Washington, DC, U.S., September 28, 2021.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote to the chair of Tesla's board, Robyn Denholm, expressing concern that CEO Elon Musk has possibly violated his legal duties to Tesla since he bought Twitter for $44 billion and that the board has failed in its duties to protect the company by not reining him in.\n\n\"[E]very Board of Directors of a company with multiple shareholders \u2013 especially publicly traded companies \u2013 is responsible for ensuring that a controlling shareholder (especially one who is also a Chief Executive Officer, or CEO) does not treat the company as a private plaything,\" Warren wrote in a letter on Sunday.\n\nThe lawmaker, who has sparred with Musk in the past over the idea of a wealth tax, asked the board to answer specific questions about the alleged misappropriation of Tesla resources and conflicts of interest resulting from Musk's purchase of Twitter.\n\nWarren charged that Musk's new ownership of the social media platform has \"raised questions about possible violations of securities or other laws, including whether Mr. Musk is funneling Tesla resources into Twitter, a potentially 'improper diversion of resources that might impact Tesla's sales and earnings' and could result in 'delays in programs at Tesla.'\"\n\nWarren cited CNBC reporting that Musk had pulled Tesla employees to help in his takeover of the platform, warning those arrangements may run afoul of state and federal labor laws.\n\n\"This use of Tesla employees raises obvious questions about whether Mr. Musk is appropriating resources from a publicly traded firm, Tesla, to benefit his own private company, Twitter,\" Warren wrote, adding that it could violate Musk's \"legal duty of loyalty to Tesla.\" She also suggested the arrangements could violate legal requirements to make public any employment agreements with executive officers, which Warren said Tesla has not done.\n\nMusk's ownership of Twitter creates \"unavoidable conflicts of interest,\" according to Warren.\n\nBecause Twitter relies on advertising revenue from other automobile companies that compete with Tesla, she wrote, Musk may be incentivized as the owner of Twitter to maximize revenue in its advertising deals with those Tesla rivals. But Musk could also choose to go the opposite route, Warren said, running Twitter to benefit Tesla by tweaking the algorithms to promote praise of Tesla products, giving the company free advertising or making it more difficult for competitors to reach potential customers on the platform.\n\nWarren added that the debt Musk took on to buy Twitter could also create conflicts, such as incentivizing him to have Tesla overpay for Twitter advertising to infuse it with cash.\n\nHate speech on Twitter could also damage Tesla's brand, Warren warned.\n\nShe accused Tesla's board of failing to take action to protect the company as its stock fell sharply after Musk's purchase of Twitter while other automakers have outperformed Tesla. Though she acknowledged not all the losses could be attributed to the Twitter purchase, \"there appears to be a direct link,\" she said.\n\nWarren asked Denholm to respond by Jan. 3 about the oversight the board will impose on Musk to ensure he meets his fiduciary duties at Tesla, how it's protecting from conflicts of interest, what sort of formal agreements are in place between the two companies and more.\n\nMusk and his lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSubscribe to CNBC on YouTube.\n\nWATCH: Twitter is now Elon Musk's company \u2014 Here's how experts responded to the news", "label": "human"}

{"text": ".. After years of investment and market growth, the digital healthcare industry is on track to achieve unprecedented M&A activity in 2021, according to one of the world's largest private equity investors.

That figure jumped to $17.6 billion in 2020, with some analysts predicting it could reach as high as $20 billion by 2021.

According to Kate Askew, managing director and chief investment officer of Warburg Pincus, M&A activity in the digital healthcare industry could reach unprecedented levels by 2021. \"We're starting to see some traditional corporate strategy investors, big tech companies and some retailers really start focusing on digital health,\" Askew said at the JPMorgan Chase Healthcare Conference. \"I think this will be one of the main drivers of M&A activity in 2021.\" Isk believes that the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the use of digital health services, and this increased use may make digital health companies more attractive to strategic buyers. \"I think there's going to be a very big wave of mergers and acquisitions that will be driven by these corporate players as well as some traditional private equity firms,\" Askew said. She also believes that the high valuations digital health companies receive from venture capital firms could lead to more M&A activity, as these companies want to take full advantage of their investments. \"The market is filled with digital health companies, many of which have received high valuations,\" says Aski. \"So I think there may be some digital health players looking to consolidate in the coming year.\" The coronavirus outbreak is forcing people around the world to become more comfortable using digital health services, which could spur more mergers and acquisitions in 2021. \"We're seeing increased comfort for consumers and service providers with digital health services,\" Askew said, \"which could lead to a lot of M&A activity in the industry next year as more traditional players want to engage in this area.\" As more and more digital health services enter the market, Askew believes that companies will seek ways to stand out from the competition. This could mean acquiring other digital health companies to provide a more comprehensive service. \"There's a lot of interest in digital health services, and companies will be looking for ways to stand out from the crowd,\" Askew said. \"This could mean seeking to acquire other companies that offer services or products that can help them achieve this goal.\" The recession could also lead to increased M&A activity in the digital healthcare sector, as companies look to strengthen their balance sheets and cut costs. \"When you're trying to cut costs and save cash, the first thing you need to do is look for integration,\" Askew says, \"which could mean making acquisitions or finding ways to reduce redundant processes and costs.\" The digital healthcare industry is in the midst of a major transformation, and M&A activity may be one of the main drivers of this change. Askew believes that the recession could create opportunities for more traditional players to participate in the field. \"I think 2021 will have a lot of different players involved in digital health M&A,\" Askew said. \"It's going to be an exciting year for the industry, and it can really shape the industry over the next few years.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Significant changes to 401(k) and other retirement savings accounts are taking place in the wake of a pandemic-driven economic downturn. The Biden administration and congressional Democrats are expected to use retirement savings for relief efforts, including expanding the use of retirement savings accounts and encouraging employers to contribute to them. The proposal could alleviate many of those struggling to retire, especially those who lost their jobs during the pandemic. At the same time, it can also benefit employers, who can offer retirement savings accounts as employee benefits to attract top talent. The proposed changes could also have a significant impact on low- and middle-income savers, who are often locked into some of the most powerful retirement savings accounts, such as 401(k)s. Here's a more in-depth look at the changes that can happen to retirement savings accounts, and what they mean for you. 1. Ways to increase the use of 401(k)s The Biden administration and congressional Democrats are expected to push legislation to expand access to retirement savings accounts, with 401(k)S receiving particular attention. The Biden Plan includes a number of incentives to encourage employers to offer 401(k)s. First, employers will be able to get up to $1,500 in tax credits for each employee enrolled in the program. Second, the plan recommends allowing employers to automatically recruit employees in 401(k)s, something that most 401(k) plans currently do not allow. Finally, the government proposes to raise the maximum age of donation from 70-1/2 to 75 years old, which means that people can contribute their 401(k) for a longer period of time. 2. Tax relief for retirement savings The Biden Plan also proposes to expand tax breaks for retirement savings. Currently, the federal government provides tax breaks for contributions to 401(k)s and other retirement savings accounts. Under the proposed plan, savers will be able to provide funds up to $19,500 to $401 (k) per year, compared with the current maximum of $18,000. The plan also proposes raising the maximum age for deduction from retirement benefits from 70 and a half to 75, giving savers five years to take advantage of tax relief. In addition, the plan will increase tax credits for contributions to retirement savings accounts of low- and middle-income savers. 3. Promotion of employer-sponsored retirement schemes The Biden program will also promote employer-sponsored retirement plans, such as 401(k)s. At present, employers may receive a tax credit of up to $500 for each employee participating in the scheme; under the proposed scheme, an employer will receive a tax credit of up to $1,500 for each employee participating in the scheme. In addition, employers will be able to deduct contributions to 401(k)s and other retirement savings accounts. Finally, the plan recommends allowing employers to match employee contributions of up to $5,500, making it easier for employers to offer 401(k)s as employee benefits. 4. More flexible retirement withdrawals The Biden Plan also proposes to expand access to retirement funds by allowing people to withdraw up to $10,000 from their retirement savings accounts with impunity. Currently, the government only allows tax-free withdrawal of up to $5,000 for certain expenses (such as education or medical expenses), and the proposed plan will expand this scope to include other expenses such as buying a house or starting a business. 5.What does this mean for you? The proposed changes to 401(k)s and other retirement savings accounts could benefit low- and middle-income savers who often struggle to save for retirement. Expanding access to 401(k)s, increasing tax breaks and more flexible withdrawals could make it easier for people to save for retirement. At the same time, employers can benefit by offering retirement savings plans as employee benefits, which helps attract top talent. Ultimately, the proposed changes could make retirement savings easier and more accessible, giving savers a chance to build a secure financial future.", "label": "machine"}
