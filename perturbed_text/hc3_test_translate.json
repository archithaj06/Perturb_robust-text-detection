{"text": "There are a few factors at play here. Depending on the bank that has offered you the card there are different types of overdraft protection that may have been set up. Typically, if they attempt to run the card with no money, if one of these is in play, you will be spared any overdraft fees by the transaction charging to a designated overdraft account, usually savings, or by the transaction failing due to insufficient funds.  If you know the transaction went through, and you know there were not enough funds in the account to cover the transactions, then you have a few options. If you have overdraft protection that auto charges insufficient funds charges to a separate account, then you have nothing to worry about. If you do not, most banks offer a grace period where you have until the end of the day to zero out your account, that is to say pay the overdraft amount and bring your balance to at least $0.  If this is a charge that occurred in the past, and you have already been charged an overdraft fee, there may still be hope. I cannot speak for all banks, but I know that Chase Bank offers a once per year overdraft forgiveness, where they will get rid of the charges if you agree to bring the account out of the negative.

Conversely zillions in \"cash settled\" contracts play out each day.  Both are totally commonplace. Different businesses or entities or traders would use the two \"varieties\" for sundry reasons. The different exchanges offer the different varieties, ultimately I guess because they happen to think that niche will be profitable.  There's no \"galactic council\" or something that enforces which mode of settlement is available on a given offering - ! Recall that \"a given futures contracts market\" is nothing more than a product offered by a certain exchange company (just like Burger King sells different products).

{"text": "Ending up with nothing is an unlikely situation unless you invest 100% in a company stock and the company goes under. In order to give you a good answer we need to see what options your employer gives for 401k investments. The best advice would be to take a list of all options that your employer allows and talk with a financial advisor. Here are a few options that you may or may not have as an option from an employer: Definitions from wikipedia: A target-date fund \u2013 also known as a lifecycle, dynamic-risk or age-based fund \u2013 is a collective investment scheme, usually a mutual fund, designed to provide a simple investment solution through a portfolio whose asset allocation mix becomes more conservative as the target date (usually retirement) approaches. An index fund or index tracker is a collective investment scheme (usually a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund) that aims to replicate the movements of an index of a specific financial market... An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is an investment fund traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks.[1] An ETF holds assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds, and trades close to its net asset value over the course of the trading day. Most ETFs track an index, such as a stock index or bond index. ETFs may be attractive as investments because of their low costs, tax efficiency, and stock-like features. The capital stock (or stock) of an incorporated business constitutes the equity stake of its owners. Which one can you lose everything in? You can lose everything in stocks by the company going under. In Index funds the entire market that it follows would have to collapse. The chances are slim here since the index made up of several companies. The S&P 500 is made up of 500 leading companies publicly traded in the U.S.  A Pacific-Europe index such as MSCI EAFE Index is made up of 907 companies. The chances of losing everything in an ETF are also slim. The ETF that follows the S&P 500 is made up of 500 companies. An Pacific-Europe ETF such as MSCI EAFE ETF is made up of 871 companies. Target date funds are also slim to lose everything. Target date funds are made up of several companies like indexes and etfs and also mix in bonds and other investments depending on your age. What would I recommend? I would recommend the Index funds and/or ETFs that have the lowest fee that make up the following strategy for your age: Why Not Target Date Funds or Stocks? Target date funds have high fees. Later in life when you are closer to retirement you may want to add bonds to your portfolio. At that time if this is the only option to add bonds then you can change your elections. Stocks are too risky for you with your current knowledge. If your company matches by buying their stock you may want to consider reallocating that stock at certain points to your Index funds or ETFs.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Many states have a simple method for assessing income tax on nonresidents.  If you have $X income in State A where you claim nonresident status and  $Y income overall, then you owe State A a fraction (X/Y) of the income  tax that would have been due on $Y income had you been a resident of State A.  In other words, compute the state income tax on $Y as per State A rules, and send us (X/Y) of that amount.  If you are a resident of State B, then State B  will tax you on $Y but give you some credit for taxes paid to State A. Thus, you might be required to file a State A income tax return regardless of how small $X is.  As a practical matter, many commercial real-estate  investments are set up as limited partnerships in which most of the annual taxable income is a small amount of portfolio income (usually interest income that you report on Schedule B of Form 1040), and the annual  bottom line is lots of passive losses which the limited partners report (but do not get to deduct) on the Federal return.  As a result, State A is unlikely to come after you for the tax on, say, $100 of interest income each year because it will cost them more to go after you than they will  recover from you. But, when the real estate is sold, there will (hopefully) be a big capital gain, most of which  will be sheltered from Federal tax since the passive losses finally get  to be deducted.  At this point, State A is not only owed a lot of money (it knows nothing of your passive losses etc) but, after it processes the income tax return that you filed for that year, it will likely demand that you file income tax returns for previous years as well.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "5,000 years ago humans did n't know much about metal , metalworking , geology , or mining . But they did have a sense for fashion . Most metals exist naturally as rock . The metal atoms are connected to other kinds of elements like silicon and they do n't look very interesting ( to a non - geologist ) . In the world before the Bronze Age , the only metals most humans would recognize were silver and gold . Gold can be found as \" nuggets \" or \" dust \" . The processes that bring it to the surface tends to deposit it in veins so that if you find some , you 're likely to find more . Typically it is exposed by weather and flushed downhill into rivers , so finding gold means finding a river with some gold or silver in it , and then looking for more - you do n't have to mine it . You can work gold without heat . It is \" malleable \" at room temperature , which means you can whack on it with hammers to change the shape of a lump of gold and bend it with tongs - and even though it is malleable it wo n't lose its new shape once you finish working it and that means you can make useful things . Gold will not hold an edge so it is useless as a blade . It is much denser than most other materials so it would make a good club , but you do n't get much more head - bashing advantage with a gold cub than you would with stone or even wood . So other than as jewelry and as decoration , gold has little practical \" use \" to an ancient human . But it is pretty . Aesthetically gold looks \" good \" next to human skin tones . Why this is so is pretty much a mystery . But it 's obvious that people found gold attractive very very early in human development . Who gets jewelry ? Rich people . In the ancient world \" rich \" was defined as \" do n't have to farm \" . There were only three kinds of people like that : royalty , high priests , and successful generals . Since gold was in limited supply - but there was enough of it that people would recognize it and value it , and it was n't good for any practical use , and as a metal it would \" stay all in one place \" and did n't have to be kept in jars or otherwise contained , it became a way for rich people to display their wealth . Gold is pretty easy to purify and to determine purity ( it 's a simple weight / volume calculation ) . That means that it could be exchanged between people for like value - a fixed amount of gold , of a certain purity , was \" worth \" some number of sheep or sheaves of wheat , or slaves , or land , or whatever . It became a unit of currency due to intrinsic properties convenient for anyone to access - all I need is a scale , a cup , some water , and a little math and I can figure out how much your gold is worth to me . 5,000 years of humans accepting gold as valuable has imbued it with a certain advantage vs. other similar metals . Nobody wants to exchange plutonium coins , even though plutonium is worth , ounce for ounce , vastly more than gold . Gold turns out to have practical uses for modern humans that ancient humans did n't know about - it 's an extraordinarily good conductor of electricity . And it still looks good next to human skin .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "diamonds are intrinsically worthless this is simply wrong. (1) Diamonds that are sold for anything less than, oh, let's say $5000 at original retail - are indeed utterly, totally, completely worthless. It is simply \"one of the great scams\". Their real \"price\" is maybe \"five bucks\". End of story. There is no secondary market.  Literally - \"end of story\". If you buy a \"diamond\" lol for \"$2000\" to impress your loved one, you can not then \"sell it\" for any amount of money.  It is: worthless. Once again: simple, undeniable fact. the diamond you bought for 2 grand cannot be resold. Ir's worthless. (OK, maybe you can get 100 bucks for it, something like that. Or, you can scam someone clueless, and get 200 bucks.) (2) However actual \"investment\" stones do in fact have a value - if somewhat fragile. Example, a few years ago I sold a stone for 30 thousand. That was a \"real\" price and it was quite liquid - I was within days able to find a buyer. (A dealer - he would have then sold it on for 35 or whatever.) I have never dealt in stones over six figures, but I'm fairly certain those are \"real\" valuable objects: just like paintings by name artists. (However: yes, the line between \"laughable diamonds\" and actual investment stones, is indeed moving ever upwards.) (Note - the \"elephant in the room\" with diamonds is that GE's industrial process for simply making utterly flawless diamonds, starting with carbon, is getting better every decade.) (A second overwheleming point that nobody has mentioned: diamonds get beat-up.  Regarding \"engagement ring diamonds\", a used one is exactly as useless as a used car.  It's crap.  Just as with $200,000 picassos, this concept does not apply to \"actual investment stones\".) Note that many of the comments/arguments on this page are very confused because: people are not distinguishing between the (ROFL) \"engagement ring scam market\" and the rarefied \"investment gem market\". The two things are utterly different. Yes, \"engagement ring diamonds\" are an utter scam, and are simply: \"worthless\".  The fundamental, basic, overwhelming scam in today's business/social universe is: \"engagement diamonds\". Yes, the price is only due to marketing/monopolies etc. Elephant in the room A: GE's technology can - end of story - manufacture diamonds.  (Starting with \"pencil leads\".)  End of story.  It's all over. Elephant in the room B: folks forget that diamonds get beat-up, they are just like used cars. Regarding \"engagement-ring diamonds\", nobody has ever, or will ever, bought a used one. Simple, utterly undeniable fact: regarding \"engagement ring diamonds\". they have: zero value.  You cannot resell them. End of story. If you buy a house, you can resell it. If you buy a car, you can resell it (at a spectacular loss). If you buy a picasso, you can resell it (almost always making a huge profit). If you buy an \"engagement ring diamond\", it is worth: nothing. Zero. Nada. strictly regarding investment stones, which is a distinctly utterly different market.  This market has no connection, in any way, at all, even vaguely, it is utterly unrelated, to \"engagement ring diamonds\".  You can in fact buy and sell these items - very much like say \"art\" or \"mid century antiques\", and make money. This market just has utterly no connection to the whole \"engagement ring diamonds\" scam system. Say you buy wine at the supermarket, for 5 to 100 bucks a bottle. If you think that the \"wine\" thus bought, has a secondary market, or you can invest in it or something: you have lost your mind. In total contrast: Yes, although totally flakey, there is indeed an \"investment wine market\" which is real and reasonable. I for example have made some money in that. (I have a great anecdote even - I had one cellar of wine in burgundy, which could have been sold for, say, 30 grand - but we drank it  :)  ) Again, the (somewhat bizarre) actual market in investment wine, just has to \"buying wine in the supermarket\".  To further the analogy: wine prices in the supermarket / your (ROFL) wine dealer, from 5 to 100 bucks, are just: utterly laughable. Utterly. Laughable. Much as folks sit around, and decide on \"label designs\", they sit around, and decide on \"price points\". There is, utterly, no difference between $5 and $100 grape juice rofl \"wine\". The price difference is simply a marketing decision: at best, you can think of it as a Velbin good. ... exactly the same applies to \"engagement ring diamonds\".", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Not exactly ELI5 but I 'll do my best to take a stab at it with some pseudo code . I 'm coming from a Laravel / PHP angle . Model : Items ; Controller : ItemController ; View : Shops The view Shops is merely a template for lack of better term . Basically we have a page where we are going to spit out the data for a record in our imaginary inventory . The page will have a $ title , and an array $ data . We will get our data from the DB with a model called Items . Think of this as a class that handles all interaction with the DB and abstracts the SQL implementation away . Our Controller titled ItemController will handle all business logic . If $ title = Acme Co. < title > { { $ title } } < /title > = < title > Acme Co. < /title > Now we need to bring the item into the view , right ? For simplicity we 'll just have two things in our array $ data . $ data['price ' ] and $ data['item_name ' ] . price shall be $ 20.00 and item_name shall be RC Car . Fancy . So our view is a very simple html page with a title and a table . < title > { { $ title } } < /title > < table > < tr > < td > Product Name < /td > < td > { { $ data['item_name ' ] } } < /td > < /tr > < tr > < td > Price < d > < td > { { $ data['price ' ] } } < /td > < /tr > Now we have the same thing but parsed : < table > < tr > < td > Product Name < /td > < td > RC Car < /td > < /tr > < tr > < td > Price < d > < td > $ 20.00 < /td > < /tr > Now imagine if $ data had several more indexes . We have one view that we pass this data to . But how do we get the data ? The model , right ? Well , yes and no . So a brief bit ; tying business logic to your view ( the pretty ) makes for a mess . It 's like putting everything into a blender for a beverage and then not putting the lid on . When it 's done you then swing it around to really get everything everywhere . Now then . The controller handles this pairing . We have things called routes , so we 're going to tell the application(website ) to point to the ItemController when the page is requested . For instance , Route::get('item/{id } ' , ' InventoryController@show ) ; So what does that do ? Simple , really . In our InventoryController class we have a method called show . All we 're doing is saying when item is requested go here if there is a parameter ( { i d } ) . So say our RC car above had an i d of 0 . We 'd go to : URL_0 and the example above would be rendered . Controller time ! InventoryController extends Controller { public function show($id ) { //Item is in our auto load . This class is accessible app wide . $ data = Item::where('id ' , ' = ' , $ i d ) ; $ title = \" Viewing Details for \" . data['item_name ' ] ; //View is in the same boat . Auto loaded . return View::make('itempage.view.php ' , $ title)- > with(\"data \" , $ data ) ; } } All of that returns the view above , just like before . Now though , we 're going to spice it up ! We have another product . i d = 1 ; item_name = \" RC Boat \" ; price = \" $ 25.00 \" ; When we call to URL_1 guess what ! Our application automagically fills in the information for the item matching the i d of 1 . Fancy ! Back to the ELI5 attempt : Automatic coloring books and stencils = MVC . ( kind of ) . Code Reuse ( stencils ) is considered , for good reason , to be a sign of a capable developer . We get to reuse the same files passing in only a parameter to change the outcome . When we first called the page we had an i d of 0 . The RC Car was returned . Then we simply changed the URL to have a 1 which returned the RC Boat . Same files different page . In a real world example we 'd probably have a master page(coloring book ) that served as the main template for all pages . This would have our CSS , JS , and other elements all centrally located . MVC means you no longer have to update your pages individually to change something like your navigation or header . It 's all in one spot . It means no need for nasty database interaction spattered all over your php files . All of that is handled in your database object . That is a central concept . Centralized code management and maintenance . I do n't think I quite hit the ELI5 nail on the head , but I hope this helps anyone that might be confused .

{"text": "Irony is a part of satire , so we 'll start with irony . There are a couple forms of irony : Dramatic irony is a situation in which the audience knows something that a character does not . ( Juliet is n't really dead . Romeo does n't know that . ) This is typically used to add to the tension of a situation . Classical irony is the triumph of wit over hubris . We do n't typically associate this with irony anymore , but any sort of parlor scene from a detective story is a good example . Verbal irony is sarcasm and is mostly performative in nature . An intended meaning is dramatically different from an expressed meaning . This is typically indicated by tone , gesture , and circumstance . Paralipsis ( talking about something by saying you 're not talking about it ) is the easiest method of verbal irony to translate from performance to written word . Situational or cosmic irony is when the outcome of a series of events is different from the expected outcome . For instance , in * The Wizard of Oz * all three of Dorothy 's companions are questing for a character trait they felt they lacked and hoped to receive from the allegedly god - like Oz , who in fact lacks the traits the companions sought and would be unable to grant those traits even if he had them himself because is revealed to be a mere mortal . Had Oz been a god , he would still have been unable to grant these gifts , but the situational would have been elevated to the cosmic . Now satire uses these forms of irony , a context of entertainment and lightheartedness , and a tendency towards absurdity , to make the serious ( Bill O'Reilly , colonial attitudes of British landlords to suffering during the Potato Famine ) seem silly .

{"text": "Well it actually kind of has , just not in the way people expected . The problem is the kind of solar you are thinking about , the green square panels . They are really , really expensive , and not terribly efficient . Those systems can take 10 - 20 years to generate enough electricity to pay for themselves . Second problem is they do n't scale well . Each individual cell generates its own power , that power than needs to be run down a wire and combined with all of the power generated by each other cell , and this infrastructure to move the power and take the individual small amounts of power and convert them into high voltage AC current to be put into the grid is expensive . We live in a profit driven world and photo voltaic cells just do n't make sense at an industrial scale . However that is not to say the solar has not made major improvements . It has ! And even though you do nt see it every day it is nearly ubiquitous at this point . Its just not fancy looking green photo - voltaic cells that have , it is concentrated solar power(CSP ) systems that have . These systems use mirrors and lenses to magnify the intensity of the sun onto a relatively small point . This small point contains a system that turns heat into steam and turns a steam turbine to create electricity . They are much cheaper at scale because the mirrors and mounting brackets for them do not require the level of manufacture that photo - voltaic does . If solar is ever to take hold at the kind of level required to become the major source of power for the world it is going to be CSP systems that do it , and not photo - voltaic . CSP systems are the only solar solution that can compete with fossil fuels on a price per kWH basis . It was calculated that the entire world power consumption could be met by covering 1 % of the world 's desert climate with CSP . It is also expected that within the next 10 years CSP should be more cost efficient than fossil fuel .", "label": "hc3human"}

It 's kind of like how Saturn 's rings are all settled in a single plane as they orbit around the planet , due to the gravity of the debris also having an effect on each other , pulling everything as close together as possible while still maintaining a stable orbit . Basically a similar thing happened around the sun in what is called an accretion disk . Eventually , clumps of the disk gathered together in more dense chunks , and the bigger the chunks , the heavier they got , the stronger their local gravity wells become , and the more debris they attracted , until these clumps all condensed into what are basically the planets , their moons , and the asteroid belt ; all orbiting in roughly the same plane as they did before .", "label": "hc3human"}

A background service regularly checks a server to see whether a notification is ready to be ' pushed ' to a program on the phone . Maybe the background service maintains an open TCP connection to the server , sending and receiving data often enough to prevent the connection being closed . ( this seems to be the Google Cloud Messaging method ) The best option is for the remote server to know the IP address of the client , and send messages to that address . But that is harder than it needs to be - there is usually one or more NAT routers and/or firewalls between the internet and most devices preventing this sort of access . This means that they need to do things like UDP tunnelling to achieve this , and UDP tunnelling needs regular keep - alive messages . Thankfully , that is all hidden from programmers and users needing to use push - notifications .

{"text": "Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial neural network  used in the fields of artificial intelligence and deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. Such a recurrent neural network (RNN) can process not only single data points (such as images), but also entire sequences of data (such as speech or video). For example, LSTM is applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition, speech recognition, machine translation, robot control, video games,[10] and healthcare.[11]\nThe name of LSTM refers to the analogy that a standard RNN has both \"long-term memory\" and \"short-term memory\". The connection weights and biases in the network change once per episode of training, analogous to how physiological changes in synaptic strengths store long-term memories; the activation patterns in the network change once per time-step, analogous to how the moment-to-moment change in electric firing patterns in the brain store short-term memories.[12] The LSTM architecture aims to provide a short-term memory for RNN that can last thousands of timesteps, thus \"long short-term memory\".\nA common LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an input gate, an output gate[13] and a forget gate.[14] The cell remembers values over arbitrary time intervals and the three gates regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell.\nLSTM networks are well-suited to classifying, processing and making predictions based on time series data, since there can be lags of unknown duration between important events in a time series. LSTMs were developed to deal with the vanishing gradient problem[15] that can be encountered when training traditional RNNs. Relative insensitivity to gap length is an advantage of LSTM over RNNs, hidden Markov models and other sequence learning methods in numerous applications.[citation needed]", "label": "hc3human"}

I suppose some people are in a position where the chances that they will face any sort of financial emergency are remote. If you live in a country with national health insurance and there is near-zero chance that you will have any need to go outside this system, you are living with your parents and they are equipped to handle any home repairs, you ride the bus or subway and don't own a car so that's not an issue, etc etc, maybe there just isn't any likely scenario where you'd suddenly need cash.

Essentially , you need to think of the efficiency of a solar cell as its ability to generate but also collect electrons as useful energy . Now in the body of the solar cell , which we call the bulk , you can get many things that will steal that electron and stop it from being collected . These include metallic impurities ( Iron , chromium , copper ... etc . ) , crystallographic defects and usually anything that has a charge that can capture an electron or a hole ( which we call charge carriers ) . The more of these defects you have the lower your effective efficiency . So what happens out in the field over time ? There are many things that can happen that can cause a module to degrade . On the macro level , standard deterioration from corrosion , UV exposure , humidity , etc as mentioned by others in this thread . We also have a few such as PID ( potential induced degradation ) and LID ( Light Induced Degradation ) . LID for example in monocrystalline solar cells is largely known to be due to the Boron - Oxygen defects . Under sunlight , boron and oxygen can combine together to form a B - O complex , which likes to steal charge carriers and usually results in a drop in efficiency within the first 48 hours .

{"text": "Stock basically implies your ownership in the company. If you own 1% ownership in a company, the value of your stake becomes equal to 1% of the valuation of the entire company. Dividends are basically disbursal of company's profits to its shareholders. By holding stocks of a company, you become eligible to receiving dividends proportional to your ownership in the company. Dividends though are not guaranteed, as the company may incur losses or the management may decide to use the cash for future growth instead of disbursing it to the shareholders. For example, let's say a company called ABC Inc, is listed on NYSE and has a total of 1 million shares issued. Let's say if you purchase 100 stocks of ABC, your ownership in ABC will become Let's say that the share price at the time of purchase was $10 each.

{"text": "* * WHY THEY EXIST * * In order to protect normal people , the SEC has created all sorts of rules and regulations for how companies that invest money on behalf of other people should operate . While this makes the investments safer and less volatile , it prevents the firm making investments from chasing riskier but possibly more profitable investments . * * WHAT ARE THEY * * Hedge funds are companies that make these investments . They are not allowed to have more than 100 investors , and they are not allowed to take on any investors with less than $ 5 million in wealth . Many of their clients are either very wealthy people or institutional investors , such as pension funds , banks , insurance companies , college endowments , or sovereign wealth funds . It 's also very difficult to get into a good hedge fund , as not only are they limited by the number of investors they can take on , but they are also rated on the rate of return they earn on assets , and the more money you have to invest , the more opportunities you need to find . If someone offers to let you invest in their hedge fund , remember the Groucho Marx joke about not wanting to join a country club that would have him as a member . * * GOALS * * So in short , hedge funds gather large piles of money from very wealthy institutions and invest it on their behalf . The goal is to do two things . The first is to demonstrate alpha . To explain this concept , think of it this way . If you hear that the stock market went up by 10 % , and you look at all the stocks on the market , odds are almost all of them went up . A rising tide lifts all boats . This is referred to as beta . Most assets , or portfolios of assets , will move in the direction of general market . Alpha is finding assets that go up even more than the general market . Anybody can just buy into a fund through say Vanguard , and own the broad market index , and get the above mentioned 10 % . People invest in hedge funds to earn an amount above and beyond that 10 % . Alpha is supposed to be the ability to find assets that will do this . The other goal of hedge funds is to earn absolute returns . What this means is that they make money every year , regardless of what the stock market does . A few funds have done this , but 2008 demonstrated that most funds were bluffing in saying they were able to do that , and many of them went out of business . * * HOW DO THEY SET IT UP * * So based on the above , the hedge fund has a large pile of money , millions or sometimes even billions of dollars , invested with it by various clients . A hedge fund is normally staffed by veterans of the financial services industry , typically people who have worked for a long time at investment banks and have contacts within the industry . After accumulating their investment capital , their frequently turn to investment banks , such as Goldman Sachs , Merrill Lynch , or Morgan Stanley , or commercial banks with investment banking arms , such as Citigroup or Bank of America , to borrow large sums of money to leverage this return . What this means if that if you invest $ 100 and make 10 % , you make $ 10 . But if you borrow $ 900 , and invest the full $ 1,000 and make 10 % , you make $ 100 , then pay back the bank $ 900 ( plus interest ) , and you made $ 100 ( less interest ) for your investors off the $ 100 they invested with you . ( The downside of this is that if you lose 10 % on your $ 1,000 investment , you 're down to $ 900 , and your investors are wiped out . This is called blowing up in the jargon , and it happens more than you would think , so leverage can be * very dangerous * ) . The banks like to lend to hedge funds though , because they like the interest income , and they like to hear what leads the hedge funds are following ( financial services is very incestuous , and rumors drive trades ) . The hedge funds like to borrow from the banks because , notwithstanding the need for leverage , the investment banks have contacts within the publicly traded companies . Say you 're doing a bond offering through Goldman Sachs . Maybe in the process of that , you meet their hedge fund clients , and talk up your business to them to drive demand for your stock , while they hear from the CFO and CEO personally , and make better decisions than the average investor pouring over financial statements . * * WHAT DO THEY INVEST IN * * OK , so now we have a bunch of guys who used to work for investment banks , with investor money , contacts at investment banks , and large piles of borrowed money . What do they invest in ? The short answer is whatever they want . There are a number of recognized investing styles though . 1 ) Long short - These are the most simple funds . They buy some stocks , and short other stocks . The desire is to assemble a portfolio that will earn both above average and absolute returns . The concept of going long and short , done to hedge risks , is how the industry got its name back in the 1950s . 2 ) Global Macro - These funds invest in assets that will give them exposure to broad economic forces , which they hope to predict . Do you think the euro is going to break up ? Short it , and euro - denominated assets . Do you think we 've hit peak oil ? Buy oil companies , and oil futures . George Soros became famous for making billions for predicting that England would be forced to devalue its currency in the 1980s . 3 ) Directional - These tend to be referred to as \" black box funds \" , meaning that no one knows what their criteria are , as it is a trade secret . Often they write computer programs designed to go through millions of pages of data , and analyze all kinds of data to find mispriced assets and go long or short on them . High frequency traders do this with stocks by setting up a computer near a stock exchange that can buy stocks and sell them again within nanoseconds . I also read about a fund that combs through publicly available filings through the Food and Drug Administration , looking for any changes regarding new drugs , to use as information on pharmaceutical stocks . 4 ) Event Driven Funds - As the name suggests , the buy or sell short assets whose price will be affected by future events . Merger arbitrage is a common form of this . When one company acquires another , usually the buyer 's stock goes down , as they are probably overpaying , while the acquired company 's stock jumps , as someone is about to overpay for it . Short the predator and buy the prey . In the movie * Wall Street * , Charlie Sheen uses contacts with a law firm to find clients of the firm who are planning mergers to conduct this sort of strategy , and is arrested when the feds flip one of his accomplices . The most famous example of this strategy is John Paulson , who made billions off the housing bubble buying credit default swaps on collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) . * The Big Short * by Michael Lewis also analyzes funds that took this approach . ( I believe Paulson is now following a macro strategy , and has been buying up gold mines , evidence that funds can change strategies ) . 5 ) Fund of funds - This is a hedge fund that invests its money in other hedge funds . By diversifying among various funds , the hope is that returns will be less volatile and safer . If one fund blows up and loses all its money , that might be 5 % of your investment rather than 100 % . There is a pretty long list of other recognized strategies , many too complicated to worry about here . ( For example , the Galleon hedge fund , which was in the news recently , was using contacts in consulting firms and other places to obtain and trade on inside information . The founder is now facing 15 to 19 years in prison . It was an effective strategy , but one that obviously had severe consequences . ) But the point of this is to indicate that they can invest in whatever they want , and will be judged solely on how much money it makes . * * HOW DO THEY GET PAID * * You 've probably already heard about how many hedge funds make billions in profits . Hedge funds get paid in two ways . The first is the management fee . If you invest money with a hedge fund ( or anyone for that matter ) , the first thing they do is take a percentage of your money from you and keep it for themselves . Hedge funds typically charge 2 % of assets under management each year . They use this money to pay employees , rent office space , and cover overhead until their real payday arrives at the end of the year . The other means of payment is the performance fee . At the end of the year , the fund tallies how much money it made for investors , and takes a chunk of it for themselves . 20 % is typical , but amounts have varied . So if the fund makes $ 5 billion for its investors , it is a $ 1 billion payday for the people who run the fund . If you have a lot of money under management , and earn high rates of return , you an become fantastically wealthy very quickly .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "This wo n't actually be for a 5 year old , but a 5 year old should be nowhere near this book nor the movie . The author that wrote American Psycho , Bret Easton Ellis , is known for a common theme in all of his books . Simply put , they are about the detachment prevalent in modern society . Specifically the effect that wealth and privilege can have on people . No one has friends only acquaintances . People are only as important as what they can do for you . Image is more important than substance . For simplicity I 'll only deal with what 's in the movie . In American Psycho the main character is pretending to be a human . He takes everything way too far because he is over acting . From the opening you see how obsessed he is with appearance and the massive overkill regarding his whole shower procedure . He is pretending to work . His father owns a competing firm and it 's alluded that they have Patrick as an employee simply because of his fathers name . He pretends to have a fiance , who of course is completely fake too , otherwise she would n't survive long around him . He pretends to have sexuality . He has no clue what it is to love someone let alone to even like someone . Patrick is filled with rage because he feels cheated . He can see all around him what humanity is supposed to be and he just is n't \" that \" . He knows that it 's getting worse and worse , and is afraid that he will be caught . He is n't afraid of going to jail or dying , but rather he is afraid of being exposed as a fake person , as a \" phoney \" . To answer your specific question regarding the scene where he calls his lawyer . He thinks he 's about to be caught , so he calls his lawyer and admits everything he can think of . The lawyer thinks the caller is someone other than Patrick playing a joke . He never takes it seriously because to him Patrick is just some bland rich guy who looks and acts just like 10,000 other bland rich guys . Later when Patrick sees the lawyer at a party he begins to freak out . When he asks the lawyer about it the lawyer , not realizing he is talking TO Patrick , laughs about the ridiculousness of it . Because Patrick is so normal . Both of these types of things are common themes in the movie and book . People constantly remark how normal Patrick is , people constantly mistake him and others for someone else . They all look and act alike . In my opinion the movie is about how easy it is for a passionless sociopath killer to blend into society because of how uncaring and superficial we all are . If you likes the movie of course read the book . If books are n't your thing then at least watch Less Than Zero and maybe The Rules Of Attraction .", "label": "hc3human"}

The voltage and current coming out of your wall sockets is too high for the majority of these devices and a conversion needs to take place .

So if we compared Niagra Falls to the power coming into your home , your laptop would need to reduce the flow of current to a flow comparable to a fire hydrant .

{"text": "The balance sheet is a deceptively easy item in accounting . What it tells you is three things : 1 ) How big of a pile of stuff do I own ? 2 ) How much money did I borrow to buy my big pile of stuff that I still have to pay back ? 3 ) If I removed everything from my pile of stuff that I still owe money on , how much is left ? This smaller pile of stuff that you have paid in full for and that you do n't owe another cent on is your \" equity \" . It can be broken down to the classic accounting equation of : ASSETS ( Total Pile of Stuff ) = Liabilities ( Stuff in your pile that the bank can take back because you have n't paid for it yet ) + Equity ( Stuff in the pile that is paid for and yours forever ) Or , in terms of a home , if I take out a mortgage and buy a $ 200,000 house , and promptly pay $ 100,000 as a down payment , I own half of a house . That is my equity . The bank owns the other $ 100,000 of the house , and that is my liability . Again , the equation tells us : Total Assets ( The Whole House , 200k ) = Liabilities ( Bank 's half of the house 100k ) + Equity ( my half of the house that I plunked down 100k for ) . To answer the question about what equity is in finance , this is how is it important : Let us say that I owned an entrepreneurial cat . The cat decides to get into the business of rat control . I take the cat to the bank , and the bank lends the cat $ 995,000 as a business loan under the agreement that the bank can repossesses everything if the loan is n't paid back with interest . The cat takes the bank 's 995k and I throw in 5k of my own money that the cat never has to pay me back for , and he buys 1 million dollars worth of rat control equipment . Now if I went on Craigslist and offered to sell the cat and his 1 million dollars worth of rat control supplies to the highest bidder , my cat might sell for close to 1 million dollars . However , once the potential buyer found out that the 1 million dollar cat owes $ 995,000 to the bank still , the potential buyer would realize the EQUITY in the cat is only $ 5,000 , and would n't pay much more than that . Now that begs the question , why would I give the feline $ 5,000 that he did n't have to pay me back for ? This relates to the second use of the phrase equity in finance , which is ownership . I gave the cat $ 5,000 to become a partner in his business . Think of this as \" seed money \" that the cat can spend on things that will make his business better , and that he does n't have to worry about paying me interest on or ever repaying directly . Instead , he gives me 100 shares of Rat Cat Stock of a total 200 shares outstanding . He owns the other 100 , which he assigned to himself when incorporating his business . What 's in it for me ? As owner of 50 % of the EQUITY in the company ( I own 100 of 200 total shares ) , I am entitled to half of the profits ! Now if the cat is very successful and makes $ 200,000 in profits each year after paying interest on his loan to the bank , that is great for me ! Going back to our general accounting equation : Assets $ 1.2 Million Dollars ( 1 Million Dollars in Supplies + $ 200,000 profit ) = Liabilities ( 1 Million Principle Still Owed to the Bank ) + 200k ( Equity , money that belongs outright to me and the cat ! ) . The amount of money we borrowed from the bank does n't change . We still have 1 million dollars worth of equipment that could be liquidated and sold to pay back the bank , so that 200k is pure profit for us ( me and my cat ) as business owners . Now this $ 200,000 can either be paid to use in the form of dividends , or reinvested in new equipment and services that can help the business grow .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "I would suggest you to put your money in an FD for a year, and as soon as you get paid the interest, start investing that interest in a SIP(Systematic investment plan). This is your safest option but it will not give you a lot of returns. But  I can guarantee that you will not lose your capital(Unless the economy fails as a whole, which is unlikely).  For example: - you have 500000 rupees. If you put it in a fixed deposit for 1 year, you earn 46500 in interest(At 9% compounded quarterly). With this interest you can invest Rs.3875(46500/12) every month in an SIP for 12 months and also renew your FD, so that you can keep earning that interest.So at the end of 10 years, you will have 5 lacs in your FD and Rs. 4,18,500 in your SIP(Good funds usually make 13-16 % a year). Assuming your fund gives you 14%, you make: -  1.) 46500 at 14% for 9 years - 1,51,215 2.)8 years - 1,32,645 3.) 7 years - 1,16,355 4.) 6 years - 1,02,066 5.) 5 years - 89,531 6.) 4 years - 78,536 7.) 3 years - 68891 8.) 2 years 60,431 9.) 1 year - 53010 Total Maturity Value on SIP = Rs, 8,52,680 Principal on FD =      Rs 5,00,000 Interest earned on 10th year = Rs. 46,500 Total = Rs. 13,99,180(14 lacs).

{"text": "Why would someone invest in other instruments (e.g. stocks) to pay for   childrens' college education when the capital gains on those are   taxed, unlike a home equity loan? Many tax advantageous vehicles exist for the purpose of saving for college education such as 529 plans, Roth IRAs, Series EE and I bonds. Tax and penalty free distributions from a portfolio of stocks is possible if the distributions are for qualified education expenses and the account is in the form of a Roth IRA.  A house is collateral for a home equity line of credit.  A combination of unfortunate events could cause someone to default on the loan and loose their residence. Also, the tax advantages of 529 plans, and Roth IRAs are not applicable to purchase a motor boat.  With respect, some people like to leave the home equity loan untapped for other uses. More Details: 529 plans are not taxed by on the Federal level when the withdraws are used for college.  In many states, contributions to state sponsored 529 plans are deductible on the state level.  These are not self directed so you can't trade stocks/bonds in a 529 plan, however, certain plans allow you to lock in the rate you pay for credit at today's prices. If you want a self directed (ability to trade stocks/bonds) vehicle with tax free disbursements for qualified education, consider a Roth IRA. There are yearly contribution limits, and penalty if the proceeds are not used for qualified educational expenses. Also I believe interest revenue from Series EE and I bonds is tax free if the bond is used for education. There are special conditions and situations to 529 plans, Roth IRAs, Series EE and I bonds, the purpose of this answer was to expand upon the tax advantageous vehicles for higher education.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "But what if I am getting paid salary from a source in India? In other words, it may be that in India a research assistant at a college on average earns a third of what a research assistant like me earns here in US. In that case, even if my cost of living there is much less, so is my salary. There are sites that provide a good guidance for what the average salary for an profession with x years of experience would be. Of course some would get paid more than average. So you can try and make a logic, if in US say you are being paid more than average, you would be paid more than average elsewhere. Plus If moving from Developed to Developing country, one has the Advantage of positive pedigree bias.  There are also websites that would give the Purchasing Power Parity for quite a few currency pairs. The Real difficulty to find is whether the Lifestyle you have in a specific country would be similar in other country. If you compare like for like it becomes slightly skewed. If you compare equivalence, then can you adjust.  A relevant example my friend in US had a Independent Bungalow in US. It was with Basement and attic, 2 levels of living space with 4 bedroom. He shifted to India and got a great salary compared to normal Indian salary. However this kind of house in India in Bangalore would be affordable only to CEO's of top companies. So is living in a 3 room apartment fine? There are multiple such aspects. Drinking a Starbucks coffee couple of times a day is routine for quite a few in US. In India this would be considered luxury. A like for equivalent comparison is \"One drinks 3-4 mugs of Coffee\" in US, and average Indian drinks \"Tea/Coffee 3-4 mugs\". In India the local Tea / Coffee would be Rs 10 - Rs 20. A Starbucks would come with starting price of Rs 150. The same applies to food. A McBurger in India would be around Rs 100. The Indian equivalent Wada Pav is for Rs 10. A Sub Way would be Rs 150. A Equivalent Mumbai Sandwich around Rs 25. I personally am picky about food, so it doesn't matter where I go, I can only eat specific things, which means I spend a huge amount of money if I am outside of India. When I was in US, I couldn't afford a maid, driver or any help. In India I have 2 maids, a cooking maid and a driver. Plus I get plumber, electrician, window cleaner, and all the help without costing me much. Things that I absolutely can't dream in US.

A foreign national may never get an Indian citizenship. Children don't qualify either unless both parents are Indian. Health Care: Again is quite different.

{"text": "Have skimmed it , these are the most important parts as I can tell : The new temperature goal is 1.5 \u00b0 C . For anybody uninformed on what that means , 1.5 us the limit the average global temperature will have risen since pre - industrial times . This is friggin huge and I 'm super excited because the previous goal of 2 was n't all that great . So basically there 's limits on the global temperature rise ( which I 'll call GTR from now cause I 'm lazy ) . The GTC 's basepoint is whatever the GTR was before the industrial revolution . The last goal for the GTR was a 2 \u00b0 C rise in temperature , which before was considered okay at best ( this goal was reached in the 90 's I believe ) . Since then new science and research has come out that tells us that 2 \u00b0 C could be bad . There 's also another thing you should know which is feedback loops : Under the arctic lies huge amounts of trapped methane . If the temperature becomes too high the ice that traps the methane gas melts and the methane enters the atmosphere . Methane is a greenhouse gas and is one of the stronger greenhouse gases . When it gets into the atmosphere it reinforces global warming and the greenhouse effect further melting ice and further releasing methane until it kills all life on earth because of huge amounts of heat . There 's also another important feedback loop , that of ice and in particular sea ice : Ocean is dark and absorbes heat . Ice is white and reflects it . As long as ice , particularly sea ice , melts , more sun and heat reflecting matter goes away the the things beneath the ice tend to absorbes that heat and sun and make everything hotter . The hotter it becomes the more ice is melted and the more Ocean there is to absorb heat which further melts ice ad infinitum until we all die . Now back to the GTR goal : 2 \u00b0 C nowadays is generally considered seriously pushing it for these feedback loops . 3 is almost gaurunteed collapse of civilization . At the current rate we 're doing things were pushing 4 - 5 \u00b0 C which is pretty much death . If we can limit the GTR to 1.5 \u00b0 C we are n't in the clear but we have a very good chance of living life comfortably on earth , with nearly all of the same luxuries we have today albeit operated differently . Before this agreement the goal was 2 \u00b0 C and they 've changed it to 1.5 \u00b0 C which is a huge and a really big difference . Aside from that one of the big concerns is that developed countries have created climate change and gotten rich off it and now poor nations such as Pacific island nations and countries like Bangladesh now have to suffer because of the west 's mistakes . The agreement says basically that developed nations have to help out financially to developing nations with protection against rising sea levels and other things and to help them convert their infrastructures to green energy while also helping them develop their economies and humanitarian situations . It also sets a goal for developed nations to try and cut all greenhouse emissions they emit . Lastly they will take stock of emissions and temperature rises and environmental impacts of climate change in 2023 and every five years after that . Also nations have to set goals for themselves every 5 years based on what they can accomplish and what they have accomplished . One worrying part is the fact that nations can back out 3 years after they signed the agreement without repercussions . I 'm also not sure how legally binding any of this is or if it even is .

Some people may think that smoking helps to lose weight or control appetite, but this is not the case.In reality, smoking actually increases your appetite and leads to weight gain over time.Smoking also damages your respiratory system, making it harder for you to exercise physically, which can lead to weight gain.It's important to remember that there are no safe or healthy ways to smoke.If you're trying to lose weight, it's important to focus on healthy lifestyle habits like eating a balanced diet and exercising regularly, rather than relying on unhealthy habits like smoking.", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}
{"text": "Vessels can carry weapons if the company allows it , most do n't due to insurance issues . I worked on a ship that did most of its work off of east and west Africa and we carried firearms . We had all the necessary paperwork(Arms Declaration , etc ) to go along with the weapons so it was never an issue when entering foreign ports . If we were going to be working in an area with a high risk for piracy the company would send a security team to meet us prior the entering the area , they would travel with us for how ever long deemed necessary . The issue is often when an armed security team travels to a different country . For example ( if I 'm remembering correct ) the Suez Canal does n't allow armed security team to transit so now you have to deal with weapons and personnel getting off the vessel . Now you got a problem of ' importing ' weapons , even though you 're just going through . We never had these issues as the weapons were ours and not the security teams . When in Africa we never had any direct contact with pirates but we did have a couple situations . Coming into Douala , Cameroon approaching the anchorage a skiff approached us with about 6 people on it . We had no security team onboard , the captain went below and came up with a few of the rifles , we held them up on the bridge wing and the skiff took off . When we got into port talking with the locals they said that the bandits ( they never called them pirates ) were from Nigeria and that they were pissed that they Somalis pirates were getting all the press . A couple days after we left two ships we attacked and 6 guys kidnapped . A similarish incident happened off of Beira , Mozambique again after we left the was an attack not too far from where we were .

{"text": "There are several ways that the issuers profit from CFDs. If the broker has trades on both sides (buy and sell) they can net the volumes off against each other and profit off the spread whilst using the posted margins to cover p&l from both sides. Because settlement for most securities is not on the same day that the order is placed they can also buy the security with no intention of taking delivery and simply sell it off at the end of day to pass delivery on to someone else. Here again they profit from the spread and that their volumes give them really low commissions so their costs are much lower than the value of the spread. If they have to do this rather than netting the position out the spreads will be wider.  Sometimes that may be forced to buy the security outright but that is rare and the spreads will be even wider so that they can make a decent profit.", "label": "hc3human"}

There was also a strong stigma against manual labor jobs ( mainly because they become far worse as your body ages ) and a lot of praise for office jobs for how much money you could make in some fields . In the 90 's , the generation that grew up on these ideals had kids and wanted them all to go to college . All of them . So suddenly massive amounts of kids were being pushed into college . The colleges reacted by raising their prices . Sometimes this was justified : they had many more students so they needed more dorms , more food , more teachers . But ultimately , college prices went out of control . The parents still wanted to send their kids to college ( thinking it was how they 'd get a good job still ) and decided to take out loans to pay for their school . BUT these loans were taken out on behalf of the kids so the loans were in their kid 's names ( in most cases anyway ) . All at once , a lot of kids with college degrees flooded the job market . Employers now had millions of applicants with college degrees . In the past , they 'd have many applicants but one or two would be college educated . Now ... everyone had one . This meant that the college degrees lost a lot of value . Since everyone had one , it stopped being special . There * are * plenty of degrees that are still useful and that you needed in your field ( medical , legal , financial , computer science ) , but a lot of kids ( myself included ) were told that they 'd be fine no matter what degree they got . And many were misguided by the college system ( who wanted money more than for their student 's to be well - prepared for the ever - changing job market ) . And of course , it 's super easy to argue that a teenager , with no real world experience , should n't be making a decision that will cost them tens of thousands of dollars , that will also greatly impact the course their career . So now ... we've got a lot of kids with degrees that may or may not be useful . They ca n't get a job in the field they studied for . Well , they can still get low paying jobs in another field just to make ends met . No big deal right ? WRONG ! Remember those loans ? That does n't go anywhere . These young adults suddenly have a lot of debt to pay off . If their degree / career did n't pan out , debt . If they have a great job and make decent money , debt . If they have a medical degree and become a doctor and start their own private practice and make great money , debt ( the average US doctor pays their loans off after 10 years ) . We now have a huge generation of young people saddled with massive debt with no way to get rid of it and few ways to improve their circumstances . There 's no real way they can afford bigger investments like a house / condo since they 're constantly paying towards debt . A missed payment does horrible things to your credit score , a lack of disposable income screws up your livelihood and social / romantic life , and without skills to get a job that can pay the debt off the debt just gets worse .

In many cases the news is already priced into the stock during the anticipation of the news being released. Other times as soon as the news is released the price will gap up or down in response to the news.  Some times when you think that the news is good, like new record profits have been achieved, but the share price goes down instead of up. This may be due to the expectation of the record profits by analysts to be 20% more than last year, but the company only achieves 10% more than last year. So the news is actually seen as bad because, even though record profits, it hasn't met expectations. The same can happen in the other direction, a company may make a loss and the share price goes up. This may be because it was expected to make a 50% loss but only made a 20% loss due to cost cutting, so this is seen as a good thing and the price can shoot up, especially if it had been beaten down for months. An other example is when the Federal Reserve in the USA put up interest rates earlier this month. Some may have seen this as bad news and expected share prices to fall, but instead prices rallied. This was actually seen as good news, firstly because it had been expected for a long time, and secondly and more importantly because a small rise in interest rates after many years of near zero rates is a sign of the economy finally starting to improve. If the economy is improving, that means more people will have jobs, more people will be spending more money, companies will start to make higher revenues and start to expand, which means higher profits and higher share prices.

{"text": "Your credit card limit is nothing more than a simple number.  When you purchase something, the merchant receives a number (i.e. the amount of the transaction) from your card company (e.g. Visa) in their bank account, and that number is subtracted from your limit (added to your balance). The amount is recorded, and isn't changed, so that's how they get the \"exact\" amount you paid.  Transferring a number is easier than the retailer having to wait for cash to get from you to your card company to them.  Moving numbers around is the basis of the modern financial system. And yes, it is always a risk to let someone else have your credit card number.  An untrustworthy company/person may use it to charge you without your permission, or if they have your full details they could use it as if they were you.  With a reputable retailer like Amazon, the main risk is data theft: If a security hole is found in Amazon's system, someone could steal your credit card info and misuse it.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "* * What 's Bitcoin * * Bitcoin is a relatively new ' crypto - currency ' . It is a unit of currency that is completely decentralized in its management , instead relying on strong encryption and peer - to - peer communication to manage it . It has been referred to as a sort of ' digital cash ' in that you must actually possess it in order to use it , and since there is no central authority keeping track of everything , if you lose your bitcoins ( eg . through a hard drive crash , reformat , etc . , ) they 're gone -- there 's no - one you can talk to to get them back . * * What 's a Bitcoin * * A bitcoin is a random string of characters that , when put through the bitcoin algorithm , will arrive at a result that indicates it 's a bitcoin . The algorithm is designed so that it is extremely difficult for any particular random string to meet the requirements to be considered a bitcoin ; only 1 in several hundred billion possible random strings will work . Bitcoins are stored in a wallet file on your computer . The wallet file contains a list of all the bitcoins you own . A bitcoin file also contains information about every transaction that bitcoin has gone through , listing in an unbroken chain every wallet ID it has passed through . You own a Bitcoin when your wallet ID is the last in the chain . You give it to someone else by adding their wallet ID to the end of the chain . All of these transactions are passed around the peer network , and each peer will check it for validity by running various cryptographic tests . If all the tests pass , the peer will agree that the transaction is valid . The more peers validate the transaction , the more certain you can be that the transaction is valid ( generally 6 - 10 validations are enough for a transaction to be \" valid \" enough for most people . ) * * Mining for Bitcoins * * Bitcoin mining involves testing millions and millions of random strings of the proper specification in order to find the strings that ' pass ' the algorithmic test to be a Bitcoin block . Once a particular string is found , at least six other peers must agree that the string is a valid Bitcoin block . Each bitcoin block contains 50 bitcoins . Because of the sheer number of strings that must be tested , and the complexity of the algorithm , this process requires a significant amount of time and processing power . The protocol also adjusts the algorithm periodically , making it more and more difficult as more aggregate computing power is used to mine for bitcoins .

They 're stuck in their thoughts . Or you see people on the bus listening to music and/or daydreaming . Now what you do when you meditate is that you become aware of the moment : You do n't give a fuck about all those annoying thoughts about yesterday or tomorrow or whatever . So basically you do n't think , although thoughts may still go through your head . Of course there are different approaches , sometimes you focus immensely on something ( often the breath ) which will use up all focus and therefore reduce thoughts , or you try to not - focus , where you feel and observe everything in and around you . And there are still even more approaches , for example some have to do with feelings ( try to imagine a person you do n't like and imagine you hug him / like him ) for improving compassion .

In the beginning you just sit there and afterwards you might be disappointed because you 've expected more of it .

{"text": "When we speak out loud there are 2 signals that the brain receives : the internal monologue and ( assuming you are not deaf ) auditory feedback from our speech output . This may be why we tend to think we are speaking louder than we actually are . Your brain also receives a 3rd feedback signal from the articulation / speech muscles . Your brain learns to associate all 3 signals with each other ( thinking a word , with the sound of the word , and the movement of the speech muscles needed to speak the word ) . So if you are thinking internally , your conscious brain will only receive the internal monologue signal . But as I mentioned , the internal monologue is extremely closely related to the production of speech ( this topic is known as \" embodiment \" ) . Studies show that when people read text silently , muscles used for speech are slightly activated . Also , speech production areas of the brain are activated when people speak internally . This all suggests thinking and speaking use similar neural pathways , and so the brain perceives thinking almost like speaking . Note : this is referring to clear - cut intended internal speech . More ambiguous \" thought \" is going to be much more complex . tl;dr : The act of speaking , the sound of speaking , and the internal thought which is correlated with the speech , are all highly associated with each other ( They use similar brain pathways ) .

The host asks you to choose a door, and your chosen door number is 1. Before the host displays something behind the selected door, he opens another door to reveal a goat. Then the host gives you the option to stick to the original choice (door 1) or switch to another unopened door (door 3). Should you change or stick to the original choice? The answer may seem contrary to intuition, but you should change the door. For this reason: before the host opens Door 2 and reveals a goat, you have a third chance of winning the car (because there are three doors and only one car). Now that the owner has revealed a goat, you know that the car is not behind Door 2, which means that the car must be behind Door 1 or Door 3. Since you initially had a third chance of choosing to open the door with a car, now there is a 50/50 chance of choosing to open the door with a car (because it must be behind Door 1 or 3), so you should replace the door to increase your chances of winning.", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

They will contribute $X to get Y% of your company and get Z% of the profits.  Note amount of profits does not necessarily have to equate to percentage owned.  This makes sense if they are a passive investor, where they just come up with the money and you do all the work.  Also voting rights in a company does not have to equate to percentage owned either. You can also have a combination of equity and debt.  If you have investors, you would need to figure out whether the investor will personally guarantee the debt of your company - recourse vs non-recourse.  If they have more risk, they will want more of a return. One last way to do it is crowdfunding, similar to what people do on Kickstarter.  Supporters/customers come up with the money, then you deliver the product.  Consulting practices do something similar with the concept of retainers. Best of luck.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Personally, I think you are approaching this from the wrong angle.  You're somewhat correct in assuming that what you're reading is usually some kind of marketing material.  Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) is not a universal piece of jargon in the financial world.  Dollar cost averaging is a pretty universal piece of jargon in the financial world and is a common topic taught in finance classes in the US. On average, verified by many studies, individuals will generate better investment returns when they proactively avoid timing the market or attempting to pick specific winners.  Say you decide to invest in a mutual fund, dollar cost averaging means you invest the same dollar amount in consistent intervals rather than buying a number of shares or buying sporadically when you feel the market is low. As an example I'll compare investing $50 per week on Wednesdays, versus 1 share per week on Wednesdays, or the full $850 on the first Wednesday.   I'll use the Vanguard Large cap fund as an example (VLCAX).  I realize this is not really an apples to apples comparison as the invested amounts are different, I just wanted to show how your rate of return can change depending on how your money goes in to the market even if the difference is subtle.  By investing a common dollar amount rather than a common share amount you ultimately maintain a lower average share price while the share price climbs.  It also keeps your investment easy to budget. Vanguard published an excellent paper discussing dollar cost averaging versus lump sum investing which concluded that you should invest as soon as you have funds, rather than parsing out a lump sum in to smaller periodic investments, which is illustrated in the third column above; and obviously worked out well as the market has been increasing. Ultimately, all of these companies are vying to customers so they all have marketing teams trying to figure out how to make their services sound interesting and unique.  If they all called dollar cost averaging, \"dollar cost averaging\" none of them would appear to be unique.  So they devise neat acronyms but it's all pretty much the same idea.  Trickle your money in to your investments as the money becomes available to you.", "label": "hc3human"}

Always talk to more than one firm, and don't be in a hurry. If you feel comfortable with the discussion, you can pursue a deeper relationship. In my professional experience, clients valued service, accessibility, knowledge. Price was way down on the list; many of my clients were not wealthy people- they just needed help navigating a very confusing (and necessary) part of their lives. Good luck.", "label": "hc3human"}

Actually those 2 are reversely correlated, imagine if rates would be 5% higher-very few people could buy at current prices so prices would drop. Also you need to keep in mind the rate of inflation that was much higher during some periods in the US history(for example over 10% in the 1980) so you can not make comparisons just based on the nominal interest rate. Putting all your eggs in one basket. If you think real estate is a good investment buy some REITs for 10k, do not spend 20% of your future income for 20 years. Maintenance - people who rent usually underestimate this or do not even count it when making rent vs mortgage comparisons. Reasons for yes:   Lifestyle decision - you don't want to be kicked out of your house, you want to remodel...     Speculation - I would recommend against this strongly, but housing prices go up and down, if they will go up you can make a lot     of money. To answer one of questions directly: 1. My guess is that FED will try to keep rates well bellow 10% (even much lower, since government can not service debts if interest rates go much higher), but nobody can say if they will succeed.", "label": "hc3human"}

I doubt that any plan ever allowed exactly what you've written, but I've heard stories about people buying gift cards from merchants and then using the gift cards to pay their bill.  This loop hole (if it ever existed) is closed now, but it would have allowed for essentially infinite generation of rewards at no cost to the cardholder.

However , these genes are not eliminated from the gene pool because they drastically increase the reproductive fitness when inherited by a female . ELI5 version - So given certain gene , if male = gay ; if female = lots'o baby making * * * The Balanced Polymorphism Hypothesis * * Argues that genes that express feminine physical characteristics and personality traits increase reproductive fitness in heterosexuals , but that an overexpression of these genes causes homosexuality . ELI5 version - being a little bit feminine can increase your chances of getting lucky with the opposite gender , but too much feminine and you become too fabuloussss for that sorta stuff * * * Alliance Formation Hypothesis * * - My personal favourite . States that in the past , males used sexual contact with other males as a way to form / strengthen relationships with them . Note that in many past societies , such as ancient Greece , it was not uncommon for a man to engage in homosexual behaviour with younger males while being married to a woman .

Look for \"https\" in the web address, which indicates that the site is using a secure connection. Use Secure Payment Gateway: Many online merchants use Secure Payment Gateway to process credit card transactions. These gateways encrypt your credit card information and make it more difficult for hackers to access it. Use Credit Card: Credit cards offer more protection than debit cards in case of fraud. If your credit card has been misused, you may object with your credit card issuer about the fee, this money will be refunded to your account. Debit cards do not offer the same level of protection. Use Virtual Credit Cards: Some credit card issuers provide virtual credit cards, essentially one-time credit card numbers available for online purchases. This can help protect your actual credit card number from being stolen. Keep software updates: Make sure you have the latest version of your web browser and any security software you use.These updates often include fixing security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by hackers.

{"text": "The important thing to know is how insects breathe . Insects do n't breathe through their mouths like us ; they do n't even have lungs . They have tiny holes in their exoskeleton which allows oxygen into system of tubes , which carry oxygen to their organs . With that in mind , let 's think about what happens when something increases in size . Two things increase : volume , and surface area . The dependence between the two is not linear , though . In other words , volume and surface area increase by different rates . Think of a 1x1x1 foot cube . It has a volume of 1 , and a surface area of 6 . Now , a 2x2x2 cube . It has a volume of 8 , and a surface area of 24 ( six sides , 4 sq ft per side ) . The volume increased by * eight times * , but the surface area only increased by * four * . 3x3x3 ? Volume of 27 , surface area of 54 . The volume more than tripled , whereas the surface area roughly doubled . Now , the point here is that * volume * is what matters for the weight of an animal . That means that there 's more organs and whatnot , all of which need oxygen . The amount of oxygen available , though , depends on * surface area * . Insects get oxygen from their skin , so to increase their oxygen intake , they need to increase the surface area of their skin . You ca n't add more holes in the exoskeleton to increase the oxygen flow to compensate , because that makes the exoskeleton weaker . The exoskeleton is * already * under extra strain trying to support the increased weight , so that wo n't work . This means that there 's essentially a point where an insect ca n't grow any bigger , because it does n't have enough surface area ( oxygen supply ) to make up for the increased volume / weight ( need for oxygen ) . For more evidence of this being why insects ca n't increase in size , they used to be much bigger millions and millions of years ago during dinosaur times . The atmosphere was richer in oxygen back then , so it makes sense .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "What honey badger something said : \" It 's when electoral districts are redrawn in order to favor a specific party or candidate based on demographics . \" And check out [ the wikipedia article ] ( URL_2 ) . ------------------ Imagine a pretend 51st state in the US . We 'll call it the State of Calville . Calville gets 10 Representatives to send to the US House of Representatives . If you 're a Democrat you would like as many Democrats as possible ; if you 're a Republican you would like as many Republicans as possible . Because Calville gets 10 Representatives it needs 10 districts . Each district = 1 Representative . How do you draw the borders to make these districts ? One way is to draw the borders to make sure that your party gets as many of those 10 Representative spots as possible . There are 2 basic ways to do that . 1 . Put ( groups of ) voters together . 2 . Put ( groups of ) voters apart . 1 . Let 's pretend a group of people always vote for Republicans : people over 6 feet tall . And you 're a Democrat and you 're in charge of drawing the borders of the 10 districts . You can draw it so that every person over 6 feet tall is in one , and only one , district . It could look [ something like this ] ( URL_0 ) or [ like this ] ( URL_1 ) . You 're basically giving up that one district . You know that Democrats will never be able to win it . But you also know that Democrats will have a * * much better * * chance in the other 9 because all the Republican voters are in 1 district . So you 're drawing the borders so you get 9 districts / Representatives and Republicans get 1 district / Representative . You 're basically using the ability to make borders to get the electoral outcome you want and not the electoral outcome the people / voters want . 2 . Let 's keep going with our hypothetical . You 're a Democrat writing the rules and you only care about getting as many Democrats elected as possible . Let 's also say 20 % of people in Calville are over 6 feet tall . They will vote Republican no matter what . A fair person might say something like : at least 20 % of the population wants Republican Representatives , therefore it 's fair that * at least * 2/10 Representatives should be Republican . But you , you do n't care about fair or what voters want . You only want to win . ( Bastard ! ) So you take that 20 % and you spread them around . You make sure that each district has 20 % , but no more , of people over 6 feet tall . That way you might be able to win all 10 districts / Representatives ! So even though a fair outcome would be at least 2 Republicans , you 've abused your power to make sure you get the result you want and not what the people / voters want . If a Republican is from a district which is 90 % people over 6 feet tall then they do n't really have to worry about being re - elected . If a Democrat is from a district where they know that only 20 % of people are over 6 feet tall then they may not have to worry about being re - elected . -------------------------- It 's a real problem and it ( basically ) disenfranchises real people .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "It is called \"Credit card installments\" or \"Equal pay installments\", and I am not aware of them being widely used in the USA. While in other countries they are supported by banks directly (right?), in US you may find this option only in some big stores like home improvement stores, car dealerships, cell phone operators (so that you can buy a new phone) etc. Some stores allow 0% financing for, say, 12 months which is not exactly the same as installments but close, if you have discipline to pay $250 each month and not wait for 12 months to end. Splitting the big payment in parts means that the seller gets money in parts as well, and it adds risks of customer default, introduces debt collection possibility etc. That's why it's usually up to the merchants to support it - bank does not care in this case, from the bank point of view the store just charges the same card another $250 every month. In other countries banks support this option directly, I think, taking over or dividing the risk with the merchants. This has not happened in US. There is a company SplitIt which automates installments if stores want to support it but again, it means stores need to agree to it. Here is a simple article describing how credit cards work: https://www.usbank.com/credit-cards/how-credit-cards-work.html In general, if you move to US, you are unlikely to be able to get a regular credit card because you will not have any \"credit history\" which is a system designed to track each customer ability to get & pay off debt. The easiest way to build the history - request \"secured credit card\", which means you have to give the bank money up front and then they will give you a credit card with a credit limit equal to that amount. It's like a \"practice credit card\". You use it for 6-12 months and the bank will report your usage to credit bureaus, establishing your \"credit score\". After that you should be able to get your money back and convert your secured card into a regular credit card. Credit history can be also built by paying rent and utilities but that requires companies who collect money to report the payments to credit bureaus and very few do that. As anything else in US, there are some businesses which help to solve this problem for extra money.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "This is actually an interesting question , and the root of your answer lies far back in history . The short version is that a highway was a road elevated above the surrounding terrain ( literally , the high way ) , and a freeway was the opposite of a toll road ( literally , the free way ) . Back in , say , the dark ages , travel was n't very common . Most people walked from their hut to the fields and back , and perhaps once a season the duke 's tax collector came in a wagon or cart . This meant that most traffic was along footpaths or rutted cart paths . As populations increased , and the cart paths began seeing more traffic , 2 big problems arose . First , the ruts got deeper , much deeper . This is a major problem in places with a high water table ( say , coastal areas or swamps ) , or during rainy seasons . Second , these low paths made it hard to see around , facilitating ambushes by bandits . By building up the path , these two problems were alleviated . The path was above the waterline , during rains the water would naturally run off the path , and someone on the path could more easily see bandits lying in wait . A high way was much safer . The downsides of the high way is that you could n't just get on it anywhere with your cart - the sides were too steep . You had to get on or off in specific locations that had lower grade ramps leading to the high way . This is still reflected in how our modern highways work . They have limited access , usually by on / off ramps . Modern highways are ( often ) elevated , limited access roads that can safely handle high volumes of traffic . However , the cost of building this highway has to be borne by someone . Hence , initially , most highways were toll roads ( aka turnpikes , because they had walls of pikes setup on the road , which was turned aside when the toll was paid . Again , literally , turn pike to pass ) . When bright , insightful people in government realized that safer traffic along those highways boosted the economy , and allowed them to collect more taxes , they decided to make the highways they build free , so that they could make more money off the increased traffic . The free way was born . Modern freeways are highways that are paid for by taxes . The meaning of highway and freeway is , literally , in the name . High way and free way .", "label": "hc3human"}

Here is a list of custodians to help with your research Here are some of the more common pros and cons that we see. Pros:  1) You can invest in virtually anything that is considered an investment. This is great if your expertise is in an area that cannot be easily invested in with traditional securities, such as horses, private company stock, tax liens and more. 2) Control- you have greater control over your investments. If you invest in GE, it is likely that you will not have much say in the running of their business. However, if you invest in a rental property, you will have a lot of control over how the investment should operate. 3) Invest in what you know. Peter lynch was fond of saying this phrase. Not everyone wants to invest in the stock market. Many people won't touch it because they are not familiar with it. Self-directed IRAs allow you to invest in assets like real estate that you know well. Cons: 1) many alternative investments are illiquid. This can present a problem if you need to access your capital for withdrawals. 2) Prohibited transactions- This is a new area for many investors who are unfamiliar with how self-directed IRAs work 3) Higher fees- in many cases, the fees associated with self-directed IRA custodians and administrators can be higher. 4) questionable investment sponsors tend to target self-directed IRA owners for fraudulent investments.

{"text": "The two terms are \" climate change \" and \" global warming . \" Global warming describes a warming effect on climate generally assumed to be the result of greenhouse gasses and anthropogenic impacts on the climate . The problem with the term global warming is that after the El Nino year in 1998 the earth went through ~10 years of no warming , perhaps slight cooling . All the science and predictions were that carbon emissions were driving the climate the warm , but this did n't happen and skeptics of the conventional wisdom pounced on it . So over time the term \" climate change \" became popularized to describe any change in climate caused by human interaction with the earth . If you are referring to human impacts that cause warming you can still be accurate and use the term global warming , but in most conversations the term climate change is more accurate because most conversations discuss more than just the warming of the earth .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "how can I get started knowing that my strategy opportunities are limited and that my capital is low, but the success rate is relatively high? A margin account can help you \"leverage\" a small amount of capital to make decent profits. Beware, it can also wipe out your capital very quickly. Forex trading is already high-risk. Leveraged Forex trading can be downright speculative.   I'm curious how you arrived at the 96% success ratio. As Jason R has pointed out, 1-2 trades a year for 7 years would only give you 7-14 trades. In order to get a success rate of 96% you would have had to successful exploit this \"irregularity\" at 24 out of 25 times.   I recommend you proceed cautiously. Make the transition from a paper trader to a profit-seeking trader slowly. Use a low leverage ratio until you can make several more successful trades and then slowly increase your leverage as you gain confidence. Again, be very careful with leverage: it can either greatly increase or decrease the relatively small amount of capital you have.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measures of interestingness. In any given transaction with a variety of items, association rules are meant to discover the rules that determine how or why certain items are connected.\nBased on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal, Tomasz Imieli\u0144ski and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets. For example, the rule \n\n\n\n{\n\no\nn\ni\no\nn\ns\n,\np\no\nt\na\nt\no\ne\ns\n\n}\n\u21d2\n{\n\nb\nu\nr\ng\ne\nr\n\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{\\mathrm {onions,potatoes} \\}\\Rightarrow \\{\\mathrm {burger} \\}}\n\n found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as, e.g., promotional pricing or product placements.\nIn addition to the above example from market basket analysis association rules are employed today in many application areas including Web usage mining, intrusion detection, continuous production, and bioinformatics. In contrast with sequence mining, association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions.\nThe association rule algorithm itself consists of various parameters that can make it difficult for those without some expertise in data mining to execute, with many rules that are arduous to understand.", "label": "hc3human"}

Classical music is a type of music that was popular in Europe from the mid-1700s to the early 1800s. It is known for its balance, beauty, and structure. If you listen to classical music, you may notice that it sounds elegant and refined, with clear structures and plenty of melodies and harmony. Romantic music is an art form prevalent in Europe during the early 19th century through the early 20th century, famous for its emotion and expressiveness.", "label": "hc3chatgpt"}

As investors identify such assets, large amounts of money are invested in them.  This temporarily reduces measured risk, and temporarily increases measured return.  Sooner or later, \"the trade\" becomes \"crowded\".  Eventually, large amounts of money try to \"exit the trade\" (into cash or the next discovered asset).  And so the measurable risk suddenly rises, and the measured return drops. In other words, modern portfolio theory causes bubbles, and causes those bubbles to pop.

Backdoors are most often used for securing remote access to a computer, or obtaining access to plaintext in cryptographic systems. From there it may be used to gain access to privileged information like passwords, corrupt or delete data on hard drives, or transfer information within autoschediastic networks.\nA backdoor may take the form of a hidden part of a program, a separate program (e.g. Back Orifice may subvert the system through a rootkit), code in the firmware of the hardware, or parts of an operating system such as Windows. Trojan horses can be used to create vulnerabilities in a device. A Trojan horse may appear to be an entirely legitimate program, but when executed, it triggers an activity that may install a backdoor. Although some are secretly installed, other backdoors are deliberate and widely known. These kinds of backdoors have \"legitimate\" uses such as providing the manufacturer with a way to restore user passwords.\nMany systems that store information within the cloud fail to create accurate security measures. If many systems are connected within the cloud, hackers can gain access to all other platforms through the most vulnerable system.\nDefault passwords (or other default credentials) can function as backdoors if they are not changed by the user. Some debugging features can also act as backdoors if they are not removed in the release version.[10]\nIn 1993, the United States government attempted to deploy an encryption system, the Clipper chip, with an explicit backdoor for law enforcement and national security access.

{"text": "Logical consequence (also entailment) is a fundamental concept in logic, which describes the relationship between statements that hold true when one statement logically follows from one or more statements. A valid logical argument is one in which the conclusion is entailed by the premises, because the conclusion is the consequence of the premises. The philosophical analysis of logical consequence involves the questions: In what sense does a conclusion follow from its premises?  and What does it mean for a conclusion to be a consequence of premises?  All of philosophical logic is meant to provide accounts of the nature of logical consequence and the nature of logical truth.\nLogical consequence is necessary and formal, by way of examples that explain with formal proof and models of interpretation. A sentence is said to be a logical consequence of a set of sentences, for a given language, if and only if, using only logic (i.e., without regard to any personal interpretations of the sentences) the sentence must be true if every sentence in the set is true.\nLogicians make precise accounts of logical consequence regarding a given language \n\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {L}}}\n\n, either by constructing a deductive system for \n\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {L}}}\n\n or by formal intended semantics for language \n\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {L}}}\n\n.

For example , it would be unlawful for * any * tier of government in the United States to charge a poll tax during an election .

When college students leave their hometown and arrive at college , they often know very few people and are not used to taking the initiative in meeting people . Fraternities provide a medium for students to socialise and bond . Since fraternities often have a reputation , students can join to meet likeminded peers who they might not otherwise meet . For example , some fraternities will have a charity focus , others will have people who grew up in a certain area , others will attract goofy guys or sporty guys . Fraternities also provide structured social situations to meet girls ( or sororities for meeting boys ) by holding parties , date nights and other functions . Finally , because the drinking age in America is 21 , most students ca n't go to bars for the first few years of college , so fraternities also function as social hubs in the same way that bars / clubs do once you reach the legal drinking age . Having said that , there are arguably a number of downsides to fraternities . They can perpetuate social stratification because current members of the fraternity pick the incoming members . Members will often only want to invite freshman students who are similar to them , and so the fraternity and sorority scene can appear quite insular . I have heard that people belong in a certain fraternity because they went to X high school , they have family money , or because they are a ' legacy ' ( i.e. their dad / mum was in the fraternity / sorority ) . Also , because only fraternities hold parties ( sororities have nice houses and do n't want them trashed ) , guys in the ' cool ' fraternities hold an imbalance of social power as other students ( particularly girls ) need to befriend them to get invited to the parties ( if they ca n't get into bars ) .

{"text": "No magic answers here. Housing is a market, and the conditions in each local market vary. I think impact on cash flow is the best way to evaluate housing prices. In general, I consider a \"cheap\" home to cost 20% or less of your income, \"affordable\" between 20-30% and \"not affordable\" over 30%. When you start comparing rent vs. buy, there are other factors that you need to think about: Renting is an easy transaction. You're comparing prices in  a market that is usually pretty stable, and your risk and liability is low. The \"cost\" of the low risk is that you have virtually no prospects of recouping any value out of the cash that you are laying out for your home. Buying is more complex. You're buying a house, building equity and probably making money due to appreciation. You need to be vigilant about expenses and circumstances that affect the value of your home as an investment. If you live in a high-tax state like New York, an extra $1,200 in property taxes saps over $16,000 of buying (borrowing) power from a future purchaser of your home. If your HOA or condo association is run by a pack of idiots, you're going to end up paying through the nose for their mistakes. Another consideration is your tastes.

Redistricting - Every 10 years when a new census comes out lines have to be redrawn to accurately decide how much representation in congress each state gets .

{"text": "A program is just a bunch of very simple instructions for doing something . A programming language lets you say how to do something complicated in terms of several simple steps \u2014 including steps that are repeated ( \" loops \" ) and steps where you might decide which of two or more things to do ( \" conditionals \" ) . For instance , suppose you are programming a little robot that can move around on a piece of paper . The robot has a pen in its belly , so it draws a line wherever it goes . You would like to get the robot to draw a square . But all it knows how to do is * go forward or back by some number of inches * , and * turn left or right by some number of degrees * . So you have to tell it how to make a square out of those moves . You might write a program like this : to draw_a_square forward 2 right 90 forward 2 right 90 forward 2 right 90 forward 2 right 90 end If the robot runs that program , it will have drawn a square , and ended up back where it started . This is , in fact , a program in the language [ Logo ] ( URL_1 ) , which used to be very popular for teaching programming to grade school students . You can find the Logo programming language [ here ] ( URL_0 ) for Mac , Windows , Linux , and other systems . Remember how I said that you can use repeated steps ? You can use these to make a program shorter , like this : to draw_a_square repeat 4 [ forward 2 right 90 ] end That 's a lot shorter than the earlier program , but it does the same thing . It 's shorter because instead of repeating instructions ourselves , we tell the robot to repeat doing them . Programs can also take inputs , for instance , telling how big the square should be : to draw_square : size repeat 4 [ forward : size right 90 ] end Or , even , instead of a square , we could draw an arbitrary regular polygon : to draw_polygon : sides : size repeat : sides [ forward : size right ( 360 / : sides ) ] end So , programs can repeat themselves and they can do different things based on their inputs . They can also control different parts of the computer , for instance sending sounds to the speakers or communicating with other programs over the network .

When nonresidents earn or derive income from sources both within Massachusetts and elsewhere, and no exact determination can be made of the amount of Massachusetts source income, an apportionment of income must be made to determine that amount considered Massachusetts gross income. 4th - Apportionment of Income:   Apportionment Methods:   The three most common apportionment methods used to determine Massachusetts source income are as follows:   Gross income is multiplied by a:   So if you go to Massachusetts to work, you have to pay the tax.  If you collect a share of the profit or revenue from Massachusetts, you have to pay tax on that.  If you work from Oregon and are paid for that work, then you don't pay Massachusetts tax on that.  If anything, your company might have to pay Oregon taxes on revenue you generate (you are their agent or employee in Oregon).   Does the answer change depending on whether the income is reported at 1099 or W-2? This shouldn't matter legally.  It's possible that it would be easier to see that the work was done in Oregon in one or the other.  I.e. it doesn't make any legal difference but may make a practical difference.   All this assumes that you are purely an employee or contractor and not an owner.  If you are an owner, you have to pay taxes on any income from your Massachusetts business.  Note that this applies to things like copyrights and real estate as well as the business.   This also assumes that you are doing your work in Oregon.  If you live in Oregon and travel to Massachusetts to work, you pay taxes on your Massachusetts income in Massachusetts.", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "They 're not loopholes . That 's just a propaganda word people use to confuse things . There are basically two different things that people sometimes erroneously call loopholes : There are tax deductions , and then there are standard accounting practices . A tax deduction is anything that you can * spend * money on that * reduces * your taxable income . So say you 're an individual \u2014 this applies equally well to corporations ; we 're just keeping it simple \u2014 who earns $ 100,000 in a year . You spend a quarter of that , let 's say , on * stuff * , stuff like your mortgage and food and whatever . That leaves you with $ 75,000 at the end of the year . Let 's * pretend * \u2014 this is not how it works , but this is just an example \u2014 that your tax rate is a flat 10 % of your taxable income , and your taxable income is everything you make in a year . That means in this year , your taxable income is $ 100,000 , and ten percent of that is $ 10,000 , meaning at the end of the year you owe the government $ 10,000 , out of the $ 75,000 you have on hand . But the government allows you to * deduct * charitable contributions from your taxable income . Meaning anything you give to charity is * subtracted from * your taxable income for the year . Since you have $ 75,000 left over at the end of the year , you can write a $ 50,000 check to your local soup kitchen , let 's say . That $ 50,000 gets * subtracted * from your taxable income , making your taxable income just $ 50,000 , rather than $ 100,000 . Since your tax is 10 % of your taxable income , you just reduced your tax bill from $ 10,000 to $ 5,000 , which is only 5 % of your gross income . Some people just look at the last sentence \u2014 you only paid 5 % of your gross income in taxes \u2014 and think that 's unfair , so they call deductions a loophole . In truth , we give tax deductions * hoping people will take advantage of them . * They 're * incentives * to get people to do certain things with their money , things like give to charity , or save for their retirement or future health - care needs , or put a kid through college . The other thing people sometimes mistakenly call \" loopholes \" are just standard accounting practices . One thing that 's been in the news kind of recently is the question of personal income from hedge fund managers . A hedge fund is a type of investment that 's managed by a person . That person does n't get paid a salary ; instead , he gets a percentage of the profits the hedge fund makes under his management . Makes sense , right ? You 're tying the manager 's compensation directly to his job performance . Well , since the hedge fund manager draws no salary and instead takes a percentage from the fund 's gain , all his income is taxed at the capital gains tax rate of 15 % , not at the income tax rate of ( up to ) 35 % . Some people call this a loophole , but that 's just propaganda . Accounting for your income that way is what you 're * supposed to do . * It 's not a cheat . It 's how the system is set up . We can talk about whether the system * should be * set up that way or not , but the fact is that * is * how the system is set up , and the hedge fund manager who reports his income as capital gain is following the rules . If he did it any * other * way he 'd be * breaking * the rules , and he 'd get in trouble for it . So basically , whenever you hear somebody say \" tax loophole \" , understand that they 're almost certainly talking about things that are built into the system for good reason and which people do because they 're supposed to . The phrase does * not * imply that people are cheating the system and getting away with it ; it 's just supposed make you * think * it implies that , so you can get mad at those dirty cheats \u2026 who are in reality just doing exactly and nothing other than what the tax code tells them they 're supposed to do .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "I 'll attempt to be concise and simple in my response . Qualification : Senior at the University of Michigan double majoring in Psychology and Biological Sciences . First , let 's talk briefly about the nervous and endocrine system . As information in your surrounding environment is perceived with your senses , it 's transformed into neural signals . Depending on the importance of the information determines whether or not your autonomic nervous system ( automatic part of your nervous system ) activates your body 's fear response . Just because it 's labeled as a fear response does n't necessarily mean you 're afraid . Even happy emotions are products of your body 's nervous system response . The underlying theme here is your body becomes AROUSED . Next , your sympathetic nervous system ( a division of your autonomic nervous system responsible for arousal ) begins preparing your body by signaling other organs to release hormones through your bloodstream . For example , your adrenal glands located directly above your kidneys release epinephrine and norepinephrine . Furthermore , various organs release aid hormones . Your nervous system increases neural firing and dumps extra neurotransmitters in your brain to prepare for the potential stressor . As a result , your heart rate increases , you perspire at greater rates , you salivate less , and above all , blood from internal organs especially your stomach ( digestion becomes less important to your body 's needs ) moves away to aid your muscles . As a result , the lower blood delivery to your stomach is responsible for the subjective feeling of emotion in your stomach . The sense of being \" sick \" to your stomach after sad events , butterflies when you see a cute girl , or feeling nauseous thinking about an upcoming exam are all rooted in the body 's automatic fear response . Keep in mind the response is so sensitive that just thinking about something stressful can trigger it .

{"text": "The reason is that your urine is based on your blood filtering through your kidneys . This is a constant process , so you are always producing urine which needs to be emptied . Pretty much any time , day or night , if you said to yourself \" I am going to go pee , even though I do n't need to , \" you would manage to pee at least something . Your stool , unlike your urine , is based on the food that you eat . You eat food in short time segments , in between which are long periods of not - eating . The food you eat has a VERY long path to travel from your mouth to your bowel , so long that when you pass stool , it is probably from food you ate the day before . Since food passes through your digestive tract slowly , the individual food - remains stay separated , and the urge to pass each stool only arises when the fecal matter comes into the area of the anal sphincter , which your brain interprets as a need to use the toilet . The release of stool and the release of urine both require relaxing sphincters in your pelvic region . So when you need to poo , it is simply convenient also to pee ( as you are pretty much guaranteed to have urine waiting to be expelled ) . But since you will have to pee more often , it is not always urgent for you to poo .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "The long version , someone else can provide the short . I interject a lot of history into this explanation which severely lengthens it , though I do n't think you can understand these concepts without learning about how they were applied . I did not discuss fascism here but will add it on to the end . The Communist Manifesto makes excellent critiques of capitalism . If you read it today , which i did last week , you 'll be amazed at how much of what he said applies to us now . The main problem is that Marx does n't give very clear answers for addressing the faults . His basic plan was that industrialized nations should move to socialism , and then after a period of adjustment move into communism . I 'll explain later why no communist country actually followed his plan . One of Marx and Engels arguments was that prior to industrialization , we produced not much more than we used . Obviously there was trade but for the most part the lack of machinery kept production levels low . Then machines come along and our ability to produce greatly increased . Adam Smith , the author of Wealth of Nations showed how division of labour increased production for manufacturers . Now instead of one person making a product , you might have 10 who accomplish different portions of the task . This made production go way up . What Marx criticized was the effect of having such a surplus . When you overproduce the price of the good decreases because the supply is so high . This required two things , one to reduce the cost of manufacturing to keep up with competition who , through free market competition , lower prices . The second was that you had to find new markets . Given the world at the time of Smith who published in 1776 , there were a lot of non - industrialized nations that you could introduce to your goods . So the more markets that opened up the more needed to be produced . Marx believed that workers standard of living decreased as people were moved into the cities to meet the demand for work . This resulted , he believed , in the workers and consumers becoming less self sufficient . Cheap goods require cheap labor . Instead of owning your own land or home , you lived in worker cities or rented in town . On this note Marx was not a big fan of private land ownership ( understatement , his summation of Communism was \" The abolition of private property \" ) . He argued that the land would be consolidated amongst the bourgeois and ultimately they would own the land / homes . We can see this today . Most people 's homes are owned by the bank , not by the family . If land was more communal you would n't having everyone paying rent to the same set of people who own the local land . Back to industrialization , this is the period of time where we find child labor , a lack of labor laws , unions , or anyone fighting for the workers themselves . Marx divided the population into two classes . The first was the bourgeois ( boor - zhwa ) who had the capital ( the money , the assets , the means to produce ) . These were the people who owned the companies or managed them . They did not produce directly , but the received the most profit from the production . The name basically means \" in the walled city \" . The second class was the proletariat . These are the workers in the factories and on the farms . Their standard of living is so low that they can only afford to survive . The name means \" those who produce offspring \" . They had enough to survive and reproduce . Now the proletariat the ones who are actually doing the work and producing the goods , yet they are treated the worst and receive little of the profits . Marx argued for a society in which the workers ruled . He argued for labor unions to protect themselves from increasingly poor conditions . Before unions , if a something happened to a worker , there was no one to represent them . People did n't want to lose their jobs defending them and there was n't much point to it . But if the workers band together and say , \" Hey we are n't going to work unless you improve these conditions \" well then the managers and owners would have to listen . They ca n't do the work on their own , they require a large number of the proletariat . The goal was for the workers to take advantage of their power , which was in production . If they had to stop work completely , or strike , it cost the owners more in lost production than it cost the workers in lost wages . Not that it was easy to go without work or that these people had savings but it was a way to be heard . All of this Marx said , was the result of industrialization and the drive for profit it produced . He stated that we stopped producing to meet needs , and started producing to make profits for a small portion of the population . He argued that the class struggle between the bourgeois and proletariat would continue to grow until a revolution occurs which will establish a state run by the workers . As an example , we can see today that about 3 % of the population owns ~40 % of the wealth ( in America ) . Basically Marx said when you overproduce ( in the search for profits under capitalism ) supply is increased , demand is decreased , and the price decreases . This is not good news for the worker as this cycle feeds back on itself , and ultimately the workers pay the price .", "label": "hc3human"}

Soldiers set up a firing line , but because the Emus are so cunning they recognized this and stayed outside of the effective firing range of the enemy soldiers weapons . Local farmers were sent out to try and lure the Emus into the ambush , but the Emus knew the trap and broke down into small herds / teams to make themselves more difficult to target . Unfortunately nearly a dozens Emus lost their lives that day . On November 4th the Australian soldiers were able to successfully set up a ambush near the local dam , a place where Emus went to refresh themselves with drink and bathe . The Gods once again smiled upon the Emus , no more than 12 fell that day before the coward Australian soldier guns jammed , stopping their assault and giving the Emus time to escape . Various mistakes on the soldiers part gave great help to the Emus being able to outlast their opponents . On November 8th the Emus were able to successfully push back the Australians after a battle of attrition . The Australians wasted numerous resources on this engagement for little results . Because of their victory the Emus were embolden , and began attacking crops , they were looking to make the local farmers pay for their collaboration with the Australian soldiers . They came in the thousands , tearing up the country side . Once again in fear the farmers begged the government for assistance , after a 4 days rest on November 12th the Australian Government began military action once again . This time the Emus did not fair well , by December 2nd they were faced with a thousand dead and thousands more wounded and presumed dead . Since the end of the Great Emu war the Emus never once forgot the death and destruction that was inflicted upon them . Every few years the farmers go back to their government requesting assistance , the Emus are waging guerrilla warfare , coming out and attacking then retreating back . Some say the Emus are still out there today , planning , plotting , one day they will retake their lands and expel those who deny them , EW II is coming .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "There is a belief among some people that there is a \" gay agenda \" , a movement to intentionally change ( American ) society . Some people think that homosexuality in any form is evil , particularly if you interpret the bible in a certain way that seems to indicate that God himself views homosexuality as a sin . So , to them , just as we should not glorify murder and rape , we should also not accept homosexuality as a common place way of life . People who believe this way see sinister motives in even people just wanting to make marriage between two men legal , abolishing laws banning sex in forms other than the missionary position , and granting them non - discriminatory rights , such as hospital visitation or fair employment and housing - you should n't be denied a job or a home just because you are gay . The gay agenda to them is any movement in society which alters society 's perception of homosexuality away from viewing them as subhuman evil people to normal human beings who just want to live like everyone else . Making them equal , making them normal , and making them accepted is a gay agenda , intended to brainwash the youth into thinking that this lifestyle is acceptable . Hidden within all of that is the premise that homosexuality is a choice . If it were n't then it would be cruel of God to make people that way without a way to change it , and it would make it harder to condemn people to hell if it was n't something that they willingly chose . I can feel morally superior to a woman who has sex outside of marriage and say she 's going to hell for her choice . It would be really difficult to condemn all women as being sinners , saying that they share the same gender as Eve and therefore , no women should be able to get into heaven . The more extremist may have paranoid delusions that go far beyond acceptance and think that there is a secret cabal of homosexuals who do n't want to just live their own lives without homophobic laws and moral condemnation of strangers , but rather that they actually want to make some straight people gay , particularly younger children . If you start from the premise that gay people are evil , condemn them , and shun anyone you know who is gay , then your little world will consist of people who are thoroughly straight while gay people will avoid you , hate you , and hide their sexuality from you . To these extremists , this justifies their thinking that gay people are very rare , only a perverted very small minority that wants to spread their condition , their thinking , their disease to innocent youth . Then , when some teenager comes out as being gay within their small , sheltered inner circle , they conclude it was the work of gays MAKING the child gay . They assume a default position of straight and choosing to be gay is like your child getting a haircut and dying it purple . Their ideal world on earth is where everyone is straight and God - fearing , and so any attempts to normalize homosexuals is seen as purely evil , the work of an agenda that wants to persecute their beliefs . It helps that if they feel like they are being persecuted for their belief that homosexuality is evil , they feel akin to Jesus , and while they are n't being literal martyrs , getting people opposing their beliefs makes them feel like they are metaphorical martyrs for God .", "label": "hc3human"}

{"text": "These systems are so useful , that many governments do n't want to be restricted to something that is controlled by a foreign government . For example , GPS is a military system run by the US Navy . They could , if they wanted to , shut it off or degrade it . The Russians were n't happy with relying on a US military system , given that there is a lot of disagreement between Russia and America , so they built their own ( GLONASS ) . In Europe , the EU government were concerned that they were relying on a foreign military system for a lot of commercial and government work . They were also annoyed that GPS only made a crude signal available for the public and law enforcement , but the military got a much higher precision signal . So , the EU government decided to build their own system ( Galileo ) which would give an improved accuracy free public signal , and a premium signal ( with paid subscription ) which would give the same accuracy as the GPS military signal . It would also be optimized for use in Europe . GPS satellites do n't really orbit over the Arctic region , so GPS reception in places like North Norway or Northern Sweden is not very reliable . The Galileo satellites are intended to go into orbits which go much further North , but the disadvantage is that you need more satellites to cover the increased amount of land . Same sort of thing with IRNSS ( India ) and BeiDou ( China ) . In general , all these systems you broadly the same technology but on slightly different frequencies . This means your receiver needs to have an antenna and circuits capable of receiving all the different systems . Dual system GPS / GLONASS receivers have been available for a while - they were n't terribly popular initially because the GLONASS system has been very unreliable with satellites dying or malfunctioning and not being replaced . However , the Russians have repaired and updated their GLONASS satellites , and it 's now a good quality modern system , so most latest generation GPS receivers do actually receive the GLONASS signal as well . One of the advantages of a receiver which supports both systems is that it is possible to get a more accurate position because you can combine the measurements from both systems when the receiver does the final position calculation . The Galileo system is n't complete , in fact , it is n't really functional , as it does n't have enough satellites to work 24/7 . However , many new GPS receivers are \" Galileo ready \" which means that they have the antenna and circuits in place , but the firmware to process the signals has n't been finalized . Once enough satellites are up and working , the manufacturer of the receiver will be able to test their firmware , and then once tested and working will be make it available for download .", "label": "hc3human"}
{"text": "Trade-in values are generally below what you can get in a private sale. To directly answer your question, you should sell the crossover yourself and use the balance to purchase your new vehicle. I would encourage you to use the $9k to finance directly without a lease, especially if you are planning on financing after the lease term. The lease will not save you money over the time you drive the vehicle in this case, and worse, will likely expose you to risk of having to pay additional fees if you break certain terms in the lease (mileage, wear and tear, etc) Best option mathematically is to use the $9k to purchase a vehicle for cash.
