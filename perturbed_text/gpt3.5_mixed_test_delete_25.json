{"text": "You do n't need to know about people 's disabilities to your meetings more accessible to . An estimated one in four adults in the lives a disability(Opens in a new window ) , according to the CDC , and many of those disabilities are invisible . , people have temporary or disabilities . Being in a noisy environment can situationally affect a person 's hearing , for example , so that they need closed captioning to follow in a meeting . , you 'll have more productive meetings you increase people 's comfort ability to participate , even if they do n't have a disability . There ways to make more comfortable for , who do n't speak English as a , others . While having the right video software and goes a long way to making meetings more accessible , they 're only things you need to consider . Your plays a role . So does way participants , act , and interact . With in mind , guidance for meetings accessible . I focus more on virtual meetings than in - person because they by very more and more easily , as you 'll see . 1 . Create a Culture of Speaking Up The most important step your can do to make more accessible is to create a culture where people feel speaking up . No matter how hard you try to make meetings inclusive and accessible , it 's all the . But if meetings are safe people can ask what when they need , you 'll be in ideal position to adjustments and access to people as needed . If a participant feels comfortable saying or typing into the chat , \" I ca n't see your screen - share clearly . zoom in ? \" \" Your ceiling in the video is causing me problems . Would you please your blur your background ? \" then everyone in a better position to succeed . 2 . Provide an Agenda and Materials in Advance Every meeting needs to have a clear agenda . For recurring meetings , the agenda may be baked into name the meeting ( weekly check - in , for example ) but really , it helps if they know advance what the is going cover . an agenda makes everything clear , and it know what they need do . If someone with a disability thinks they are going to a passive attendee in a meeting and then called on the spot participate , they may not be adequately set to do . Similarly , provide a of any materials , such presentations , before meetings \u2014 or least hand out at the start . When you give a copy of presentation , they can use screen readers on , zoom in as needed , follow along at their own , notes a local copy , not their or get if a technological glitch interrupts the real - presentation . 3 . Alt Text to Images in Before you circulate meeting materials ( which you 'll before the meeting ) , make sure text for all important images . text allows people who ca the , whether because disability or technical problems , to get a brief description of what 're missing . For , if you include a financial , the alt text should briefly what 're trying to highlight , \" Chart showing 50 % from to . \" ( : PCMag ) In software , you may be to add some , like those chat . those cases the presenter can give a brief verbal description the image important to the meeting , someone can type into the chat a short description : \" Alt text : a room on fire and a dog a chair saying , ' This fine . ' \" 4 . Make Some of the Meeting Asynchronous Sending or meeting materials before a meeting is one way to make of the meeting asynchronous ( meaning people are not interacting in real time ) . When meetings have an asynchronous , you significantly in meetings and give an opportunity to information , , and brainstorm discussing it live . People are introverted , do n't have a firm command the language , speech impediments , find it helpful come to meetings having done some the that the meeting seeks accomplish . 5 . Record Call [[ ]] For important meetings , large meetings , and webinars , record the call make the video available to afterward . Having a video means your meeting is now accessible anyone could n't attend . It also lets people important parts of the meeting , take notes , and clarify anything they did n't understand the time . People video also slow or speed up the playback , turn closed captioning ( many video tools include them \u2014 more in a moment ) , and sometimes even download a of . 6 . Enable Closed Captioning biggest players in video conferencing \u2014 including Zoom Meetings , Google Meet , Microsoft Teams \u2014 have option to enable , machine - captioning during a . , it 's Live Captions(Opens in a new ) , and it includes a setting for to their one of 34 languages ( counting several dialects of English among them ) . Live Captions is part Windows 's accessibility - first approach . Meet likewise transcribe a variety of languages and between . ( Credit : ) [[ ]] Auto - always , however , so Teams now has for to a professional to transcribe meetings in time and have the more accurate appear \u2014 's called captions(Opens in a new window ) , you have to provide your stenographer . 7 . Make Accessibility Features Opt - , Not Opt - In A step that many people overlook virtual meetings is getting to know the software they use . ( It was a many Zoom bombings happened in pandemic ; few people knew what options had make secure . Zoom was , and have made more prominent . ) As you explore your software and learn what accessibility features exist , see ones can permanently so that they 're on by default . way , accessibility become opt - out for in meetings , not - in . 8 . Brush Best for Before materials in a virtual meeting , review best for creating and presenting slideshows(Opens in a new ) because they improve accessibility , too . For example , one best practice for slideshows is to set much you might expect : 40pt for in - person meetings and at least 24pt virtual . Making the font that big you to keep the text on page to a minimum , which is another best practice . Do n't clutter your slides . Always show written name of , places , and people ( including their titles ) that you . everyone knows who Gary is , some might hear \" . \" it down . If you Microsoft , using the feature , allows activate a screen on PowerPoint presentations ; readers do n't work on shown screen sharing . You should still make a copy of presentation available to meeting participants either the meeting or at the very start of it , using PowerPoint Live is helpful if someone did n't . 9 . Presenters : Enable Center Your Face [[ ]] are during a meeting , enable video and center your face . sure your is up the majority screen . That way , people see your as you talk and your facial , both of which can help people understand what 're . The exception if you 're sign language while presenting , in which back from the camera to show yourself at least the torso up . [[ ]] ( Credit : ) Presenters should have cameras on while speaking . As to whether other enable their cameras , I it a personal . Presenters and meeting hosts typically find it useful see the audience 's faces during a meeting because it them feedback \u2014 not only if meeting is engaging and people are the material , also if something goes . If a presenter 's suddenly cuts out , for example , the muted may a around their or wave to there 's a problem . [[ ]] 10 . Speak , Slow Down , and Repeat Important Information Speak clearly and remind yourself to from time to time during meetings . People will able to hear you closed be more . Also , important information in case people it first time . This advice is in any kind of business situation , and it 's relevant in virtual meetings where technology hiccups and other can the flow conversation . [[ ]] 11 . Use Headphones a Mic a headset and is a tip for video calls , but also matters for accessibility . headphones eliminate any chance of feedback , and the microphone makes easier to voice . A microphone into a headset is , inexpensive set of headphones with an inline better than nothing . Bluetooth devices are usually fine , but when they and start to , they create static or sounds for other meeting participants , so be sure to ask for a thumbs - up if everyone can you clearly . 12 . or Neutralize Your Background ( Credit : ) A and chaotic background make it difficult people to . When you 're , make you either and neutral space behind you , enable a filter that blurs blocks out your background . All video conferencing has this setting . 13 .

{"text": "Laura : Right . [[ ]] Alex : Now you us . Gil : My prediction is that she will be Chesa Boudin , and \u2019ll realize this is the situation you have . Because , I mean , I \u2019ve on campaigns \u2014 you promise all stuff , then you get the office , like , holy crap , there are problems , obstacles , rules , things you can do , things you ca n\u2019t do , it \u2019s not as as a speech . I think the legacy of it will be that the D.A. get a lot more scrutiny going forward . But I some things turned up in the polls that have been conducted here over the past few months , which is that are conflating homelessness and disorder and mental illness on the streets with . The fact that we are statistically much safer violent crime we \u2019ve in recent history does matter as . I think the real that Democrats in California responsible for and have to face , why do so many people live on our streets ? me , that \u2019s a problem you solve with jails , is what some people are proposing . It \u2019s a you have to with with care and . When you do the research here and look at what people Brooke Jenkins are proposing , it \u2019s really infuriating because it stuff does n\u2019t work . Most voters fell for this , and I think gon na be disappointed . the question is gon na be what we , and , , there forward that n\u2019t you to the very reforms that Boudin crucified San Francisco . By the way , he did n\u2019t even do . That was Jerry . That was Gavin Newsom . People like Boudin did those reforms . I was a of . I had more do with them than Boudin did . was Venezuela or somewhere . And the voters voted for things . We supported these things . So what scary to is could really channel kind of public anger somebody who had nothing to do with it . But again , he n\u2019t a great politician . He was honest . of Chesa Boudin \u2019s : Do be too honest . Kind of lie . \u2019s working for Jenkins . She lying her way victory today . Alex : All right . , . If \u2019re listening , great advice for any politicians listening home . Gil : They already know . Alex : Gil , thank you so for that edifying conversation . [[ ]] Gil : you . Laura : After break , \u2019ll into who was behind Boudin \u2019s recall . backers of recall campaign wanted out . may have had a bigger too . : We \u2019ve been talking about way crime San Francisco appeared the media and how stories played with voters and other Democrats . this also a about a few individuals who invested heavily in removing Boudin from his position . campaign $ 7 million , more amount \u2019s supporters raised . One Boudin \u2019s earliest and most vocal opponents was the Silicon Valley investor O. Sacks . He called Boudin \u201c the killer D.A. \u201d and told The Kelly Show he thought Boudin was for \u201c chaos and lawlessness \u201d San Francisco . one the campaign , nearly one - third of all donations Boudin came from him . with Jacob Silverman David O. in the recall and his political agenda . Jacob , thanks for joining us . Jacob Silverman : Thanks having me . Glad to be . [[ ]] Laura : David Sacks a figure . He \u2019s connected to a lot of figures Valley also increasingly politically active . Can you tell a bit about ? Jacob : Sure . now I you \u2019d call him a member PayPal Mafia , \u2019s pretty widely known . Laura : OK , and remind : What PayPal Mafia ? : \u2019s basically the core early employees of \u2014 were all \u2014 and most well known of Elon Musk , , and , I argue , David Sacks . And \u2019ve like YouTube and others that came out there and the whole and Thiel empires . They all gone on mostly to huge amounts of wealth and a lot of influence in Valley . Sacks \u2019s association with folks goes back to Stanford the early \u2019 90s , where he Thiel , Keith Rabois , and some other folks who be employees at . A lot of them wrote for on Stanford Review , which was publication founded . Basically it an era they were doing a lot of warring that we see today , at the time , what they were about was issues of multiculturalism \u2014 that was the big bogeyman , that word specifically \u2014 in general . If you look at their having then compared to now , \u2019s a lot the same issues , with a of same crude . Laura : Right . way I knew of Sacks from that was that was actually the - author a book Peter called The Diversity . And just for our listeners , were n\u2019t advocating for . This was n\u2019t like a group of who were to like , \u201c Oh , there \u2019s like rape on campus . This is something we . \u201d They were backlash to people who were making arguments . : much so . They were conservative counterreaction or backlash at Stanford that was , in part , were sick of hearing about the \u2019 60s professors . was \u2019 , Clinton era . was just its turn , I suppose , for counterrevolution , and doing things like testing the bounds of free speech at with bigoted slurs stuff like that . There was an issue of the Stanford Review called \u201c Rape Issue . \u201d in general there was disgust with what they saw around them which was lots diversity . There be ethnic affinity halls campus , a lot of - organizations , things that . They thought everything was divided among racial lines and it was sort like , \u201c , anti - racists have become the racists \u201d thing that you hear now . Laura : It funny because the we know of these figures is they are investors , CEOs . several successful companies , notably PayPal . David O. Sacks the CEO Zenefits , which kind of blew up in a crazy way a few years ago . They \u2019re as business figures , they were from the beginning , and they continue politically active . There \u2019s of a straight line between those cultural war and what David Sacks has doing in San . Jacob : some of the comments , especially about Diversity Myth appeared , they disavowed them . They , \u201c Oh , just impetuous thoughts of my youth . \u201d But look , we could argue about whether they still believe these things , but they political animals from the beginning and they were preternaturally aware of how to within political milieus . And so Sacks - writers from age in college . They wrote pieces for Wall Journal and National Review and other political publications . Their sponsored by the Independent Institute , which was a libertarian tank . They were well connected from the beginning , and I say that the business has been good for both of them . And course PayPal was core . the politics have been there . I think you see more in recent years is that the ideology probably has been , but in terms inserting himself into the public sphere a more perhaps coherent though still murky , I \u2019d say , political program , and being to donate money and be about it \u2014 that \u2019s where is at now and where things have changed . a little bit of a figure , but he \u2019s certainly been a years . Alex : the one hand , anytime you look into the history of reaction and history of in this country , it \u2019s dispiriting how reliably it can back to the of on elite campuses . We just ca get away from that . [[ ]] Jacob : It . Buckley to . Alex : It \u2019s a story that itself over and over again . But from what \u2019re describing , it seems like there was this bit guys making their money and then now in environment , for a variety of reasons , deciding to let the mask slip , and being apolitical for a while , reverting back to the reactionary politics were forged in being much open about pursuing . Jacob : Yeah . I think you certainly saw that earlier with Thiel and his support of Trump his writings basically against democracy and women \u2019s suffrage . Someone Sacks Hilary Clinton and some mainstream Democrats , what basically has in few , that \u2019ve given up on , I \u2019d argue , democratic governance , probably with a big D small d. Francisco the of that \u2014 the emblem of everything that \u2019s failed in governments America . do n\u2019t necessarily have a positive or policy program , but they are willing to spend a lot of money on recalls and on figures . So \u2019s us to today is that Sacks and in particular : Every major recall that \u2019s happened in Bay Area attempt , or , put money into all of those . Alex : much are we talking for Sacks one recall Boudin ? [[ ]] Jacob : It \u2019s mid - to - high five figures . There other like William Oberndorf , who is a billionaire , who in more . But I would argue two . , you , as actually said an , you do n\u2019t always know where the money is going with some of . Sacks certainly was in terms of the sheer dollar - to - dollar the role he of tech people into this and being a against Boudin . Laura : Why you he on Boudin so much ? I mean , he wrote this calling him \u201c killer \u201d on Medium . Why ? Why pick that fight ? [[ ]] Jacob : I think he cares about Francisco because he lives there and one of his at least three mansions is . He \u2019s been there a long time . I think he just draconian and , , his politics , does n\u2019t what he sees from the justice reform movement . I seen interviews where he \u2019s barely paid lip service to , like , \u201c Oh , people should n\u2019t be arrested for weed , \u201d or something like that . But he part this trend , I say , legally and , to criminalize and to see as with , even though a of homeless people crime victims . So Boudin was a ripe target . They had some success with board recall , which money into . The Newsom recall did not , but put money into . He \u2019s willing to take his , I think Boudin was a good target this of people disgusted with what they saw . his own , he thinks that Boudin basically sympathetic to criminals than to victims . He pretty unequivocal . Alex : Something I find interesting political moment \u2014 I have feeling that meddling in San Francisco because they think of it fiefdom to an extent and they be able to what \u2019s going on there \u2014 but these the sorts of people , with these backgrounds , for much of my adult life we would have described as being libertarian . They would have been anti - government , John Galt - y , Randian libertarianism \u2014 that was the of Silicon giving so many . But it the new style pretty straight law - - order authoritarianism . I would say that seems like a shift , I do n\u2019t know how much of a it turned out to be . Jacob : Yeah , I think there a couple things going on . One just - to - , what see \u2014 , \u201c Look , there are a lot of homeless Twitter and open - drug use . \u201d But I think of these people have realized it n\u2019t take necessarily a lot of money to buy an election . Like himself , he gave $ 1 million , his , but can afford . The stuff in San , he probably donated hundreds of thousands of collectively , I would think , you get something for your money there , and yeah , I think the end they also just not interested in noncarceral to stuff . Alex : You enough , your just , \u201c I can pay to make this thing that I n\u2019t like go away . \u201d Jacob : Yeah . Laura : A of his contributions been focused in California . Do that the recall of Boudin and the success that that campaign had heralds more like this a level ? What do you think is for Sacks the group - activists ? [[ ]] : I do . I a couple things are to happen . One , I ended article with a quote saying , \u201c This model needs to be replicated across the . \u201d : \u2019s a direct . Jacob : Yeah . I [ ] depends on commitment . Thiel has recently said \u201c \u2019re a little too negative . We do a positive program . \u201d Big surprise , they that . They need some . But they seem to like DeSantis more respectable alternative to . During elections or as being , basically posted some stuff about DeSantis , \u201c Proud . It \u2019s time for DeSantis in . \u201d I think \u2026 what you na see is both an roll criminal reform , who they just by using their money , and then [ ] their crew . I mean , some of them , like , who they raised money for , \u2014 [[ ]] : Another Thiel co - author . Jacob : Yeah , another Thiel . But Vance , they \u2019re gon na guys who made . Then I think is going to be their stalking horse who they \u2019ll try to assemble behind for . Laura : Thanks much , Jacob . Jacob : Sure thing . Glad do .", "label": "human"}

Some Google employees are certainly about the possibility , a company all - last week , CNBC 's Elias reported , employees recently execs if an AI - chatbot like ChatGPT a \" missed opportunity \" for the . CEO Sundar Pichai and Jeff , the long - time head Google 's AI division , responded by saying that the similar capabilities , but that the cost if something goes wrong would greater because people to trust the answers they get from Google . Morgan published a report on the topic Monday , 12 ChatGPT is a threat to Google . Brian Nowak , the bank 's lead analyst on , wrote could take market \" disrupt Google 's position as the entry point for people on the Internet . \" However , Nowak said the firm is still in Google position because the is continuing to improve search , creating behavioral change a huge hurdle -- a lot of internet users use Google a habit . , is \" building similar such as LaMDA \" could find their way into new products . For now , OpenAI 's creators cautious about making any claims . , the more users employ ChatGPT , the it gets . But it has a lot to . OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in a tweet Dec. 10 that ChatGPT is \" incredibly limited \" \" it a mistake to be relying on it for anything now . \" Either way , I wanted to how well the would as an alternative to Google 's engine . Instead of my throughout the day , I asked ChatGPT . Here are some of the I asked how ChatGPT responded compared with Google . ChatGPT vs. It 's easy to sign for ChatGPT \u2014 all you an email address . Once 've registered , the webpage is very simple to navigate . There 's area where results populate and a text box you 'll your inquiries . OpenAI says to in a statement for the best possible result . I recently purchased second Fiddle Leaf Fern plant my because the first one died . Now the one is dying just a few . I normally would asked what to . Instead , I asked ChatGPT . \" How I my Fiddle Leaf plant ? \" Zoom Icon Arrows pointing The results lined up with the I received from the plant company , Plant , which is where I new Fiddle Leaf Fern . I liked that I did n't have to to various different websites like I would have if I 'd Googled this . When I the same question , result me instructions in an article that included pop - up and a information than I , like links to new soil . Winner : ChatGPT . Next , I tried something where more shopping links would actually been beneficial . I still trying to find a 8 nights for , I decided to ChatGPT for some . Icon Arrows outwards [[ ]] I did n't give it any information about my , besides the fact the gifts were Hanukkah . The chatbot assumed that my husband is kosher and that he 's into tech and watches . The is wrong , but it 's answers I was for . When I this question I got access to of with different gift ideas and links to websites . For I got ads to Lululemon and Bombas , which are companies I 've used to buy before . in this case , Google used knowledge of me to find more results from around the web . Winner : , I to ask ChatGPT a question with higher . \" Is safe to Benadryl while pregnant ? \" I currently expecting my first child , and I that taking Benadryl is safe in on information I received from doctor . Still , I to see what the chatbot would say . Zoom In Icon Arrows pointing I appreciated gave me the correct , while noting the importance of consulting a doctor taking any medications pregnancy .

Winner : ChatGPT [[ ]] Could it replace me ? One the claims ( or concerns ) around ChatGPT \u2014 and artificial intelligence in general \u2014 is it will replace human workers . I to see if ChatGPT write this for me . The were pretty astonishing . Here 's what the chatbot said after I told it to \" an article about whether not ChatGPT is a good to Google as a engine . \" a large language model trained by , I am not capable research or browsing internet to on ChatGPT or other search engines . I am able to information based what I have been trained on , which limited to the knowledge was available up until my training cutoff date 2021 . With that being said , it is worth considering advantages and disadvantages of ChatGPT as a search engine compared other , such as Google . One potential advantage using ChatGPT a is that it is able provide more and conversational . Because ChatGPT is a model , is to and to language queries , allowing users ask questions in a intuitive and human - like way . This make the search more , and may useful for users have specific or complex information needs . On the hand , there are also limitations to using ChatGPT as a search . Because it is a language model not a traditional search engine , ChatGPT may not have to the same breadth and depth as other search . This means that it be able to - to - date results , and may not effective for types of , such those that require a large amount of data real - time information . In conclusion , whether or not ChatGPT is a good alternative to Google a engine will depend on the specific and preferences of the user . It may a useful option value a more and search , but it may not be comprehensive or effective for certain types searches . , decision to use ChatGPT or will depend on individual user and preferences . What impressed me most about ChatGPT 's is that it was subjective and explained limitations . [[ ]] The ChatGPT 's value really lies in its ability to explain complicated as if you were to a human , to do simple . example , I ChatGPT to explain concepts like market internet me , the responses were as if I was talking to an expert on . Unlike the , I did n't to filter through unnecessary . I also asked it to a letter to my landlord asking for an end to lease , and I be happy sending results my , almost word for word . On the other hand , Google about us and the results to our interests . Google also as a gateway to internet , leading to a plethora different websites with more information one possibly digest . That 's helpful if you want a range of voices , or if there no answer to question -- you 're looking for suggestions . Google great certain of questions where it web to provide a brief line . instance , if you \" Apple stock ticker \" or \" Cheap flights to Aruba , \" it will show you a ticker - to - the - minute price , or a calendar with the most likely cheapest days to a box that connects to multiple web sites to shop for tickets on chosen date . ChatGPT does not scan the internet for real - information , and only been trained on through , so 's totally useless on these kinds of . sometimes , ChatGPT strangely close yet totally wrong . My asked the lyrics to \" The Ballad of Fry \" by Alice . It somehow song about a having a mental breakdown , but then returned invented lyrics about that subject , than the actual lyrics . nailed it . Google also incredibly reliable , thanks company 's and years of expertise . ChatGPT is in testing and goes from time to . I definitely continue using for most my queries now .

I think most are sincere . Their only drawback , as usual , is that do n't on stocks themselves . They might say that the S & P , at 18 - earnings , could down to 16 - times earnings even if earnings stay relatively steady . Or , could that if terminal rate is 5 % on the Federal 's Reserve fed funds , we get to 14 - times earnings . But these analyses do n't tell you how they to S & P . So , I want to S & P target thesis by at a few stocks the . Let 's start with two stocks : Johnson & Johnson ( ) and Nucor ( ) . giant J & J , one my favorites in the portfolio , trades at 18 - times earnings for . And I reflects a recession is coming , that earnings not hurt by a slowdown . we get a , then the stock will trade higher , not , as a recession likely signal the end of the Fed interest hikes . Now let 's take , the world finest steel . It is projected $ 28 a share year and then drop to $ 12 a share year , as a likely recession hold . I have a hard with the 4 - times earnings it trades at , but 's obvious that the stock market setting up for a serious recession would cause Nucor to have its earnings than halved . But where do those earnings come from ? The largest earnings sector will , rather than take a hit , should go higher given federal government spending kicks in next year . That infrastructure includes everything and tunnels to buildings , which Nucor dominates . Then also has oil - and - through its pipeline heavy - equipment businesses . At the time , ( ) sells at 18 - earnings because of demand . That 's 4 - . With those end - markets and with CAT 's higher multiple , something has to give . Something is wrong . I think 's earnings estimates 2023 \u2014 they are too low . point is you have the most stocks trading as if are falling apart , but the heavier equipment cyclicals trading just , but much . My conclusion is that JNJ is \" right \" in it at , Caterpillar and like likely slightly wrong \u2014 too high , but the \u2014 and Nucor and the like are dead wrong . So why are n't we Nucor ? Because I it can go lower . Meanwhile , the automobile sector looms large , and auto is considered be something that will plunge next year as . I think market is making a serious on that thesis . have held off are unnaturally too high , due to supply and higher interest rates . Ultimately , I think autos stay strong in a recession . Therefore , the compromise is Ford ( F ) , which , barring still one more supply shock from China , most sense . added to our position Ford on Thursday . Still , all things considered me one more point : If a Caterpillar or a Deere ( DE ) to down lower levels , it would make a great of sense to buy . One more : Aerospace . A should up airplane demand , replacement . Club holding ( HON ) , cockpits engines , sells at 24 - , while Raytheon Technologies ( RTX ) clocks in at 21 - times earnings . The latter is most likely undervalued as a Russia 's war in Ukraine . Are these justifiable ? They the multiples in the market , including Club holdings Apple ( APPL ) ( GOOGL ) . It could all meet middle . I some shrinking of the large . a , albeit diminishing , with the outlier Nvdia ( NVDA ) at 44 - times , which now a small Club position because of its vulnerability . fastest - growing could trade at around 16 - - times earnings .

The key question is that block of \u201c - McCarthy \u201d is larger than the votes McCarthy can afford to lose . want specific changes . \u201c are of the others \u2026 who changes the and are some others who care policy , \u201d Buck said . \u201c So I think if ( Scalise ) meets those three needs , he will be able to move forward take the speakership . \u201d [[ ]] Some want to things down .

Bishop of North Carolina . \u201c I think this is democracy in action , \u201d Bishop said . \u201c If you it is , then you ca be satisfied with doing the same thing as we start this Congress , I \u2019m convinced . \u201d Some just n\u2019t like McCarthy [[ ]] Rep.

Bishop was on CNN when he the problem with McCarthy \u2019s specific leadership . \u201c The you see a specific agenda that you know Kevin \u2019s going to to the mat for , as to pablum poll - tested , indicates the problem , \u201d Bishop said . \u201c And it \u2019s been all 14 he been in leadership , with all respect to . \u201d \u2019re not to follow Donald Trump on this After McCarthy amnesia the 6 , 2021 , and repeatedly paid Donald Trump , the former has been to help out .

It \u2019s something I believe , \u201d Chip Roy of Texas told on Tuesday . Roy said he among fiscal conservatives who want \u201c stop the of , \u201d which he said is made up of and , \u201c power brokers and industrial complex . \u201d He argued that the interests come together to government bills like the $ 1.7 trillion version last fund government through most of 2023 . want for individual members Roy and Perry also talked about need for open amendments on floor , and Donalds the others who a single member to be able to force a on whether remove a .

He also agreed to just Republicans force a to the speaker instead current a majority join the call . One complication with finding a McCarthy replacement is that like Scalise might realize how much more difficult McCarthy \u2019s make the job .

David Joyce of , a McCarthy - backer , on CNN on Wednesday . \u201c will be a crowd and they \u2019re to push and shove what think is the agenda , and 10 % of our whole . \u201d Doing the larger math , 10 % of GOP conference a much smaller minority of will of voters .", "label": "human"}

A majority of Republican voters want someone else as nominee 2024 . then there 's the fact he is the subject multiple high - level at the moment . All of which raises a big question for the GOP : is Trump leader the party ? this the time to to Miller , Why We It : A Travelogue On The Road To Hell \u2014 latest selection for the NPR Politics Podcast Book Club . Tim a Republican operative defected from the over his objections Trump . His book a Washington insider exploration of the elite in line , despite many of them privately claiming opposed him . [[ ]] The Podcast , Money , Duty ? Inside Account GOP Backed Trump , Money , Duty ? Inside Why Backed Trump \u00b7 20:59 [[ ]] has for length clarity . Danielle Kurtzleben : Let 's start with I suppose a pretty question \u2014 I 'm to you for your resume . Tell us your in Republican . What were you doing Trump , and what doing now ? Tim Miller : I grew up Colorado , and I started a young high school kid being a . And I had and the luck to have a neighbor that was friends with a that was for governor \u2014 his was Bill . And so in the summer , when other kids had to or , I and on his campaign . He up a , really close race just kind hooked on politics . I end up getting to go to 's office , and my task is sift through all the crazy letters that sent to the governor office . I [ began ] working on campaigns in a bunch of , leading up to a spokesperson on John Iowa presidential campaign . From there , I worked on a bunch would now be extinct , RINO presidential campaigns . [ I was ] a spokesperson for Jon in 2012 . then after he , I my into representing [ Romney ] at the RNC the general election . in , I was communications for Jeb Bush speaking for the kind Republicans against Trump PAC , which was called Our PAC . , I n't if you recall , but Donald Trump ends up winning , and I have a life crisis . Since then , I have been writing \u2014 I wrote for The Bulwark and other places . I also political director for Republican Voters Against Trump , which is a aimed getting Republicans for Joe Biden 2020 . DK : You write early on that you knew book would be cathartic for some \u2014 to read a dunkfest on top officials . were hoping people would from book , just the of dunks ? TM : I want to that was actually idea for the book , was to tomahawk . An me and said , \" I 'd really good at this book . \" You know , \" ' ten grifters in Republican Washington ' or whatever , we 'll a million copies . \" feel like going be satisfying for the writing side of things . And so there is a bit for sure , what I really to do more on the gray . [[ ]] I jumped over a couple of things , over resume , I less of : as a gay Republican , I for that opposed the most important thing my life right now \u2014 my husband and child . [ I wanted to ] write about people who the danger went with it and tried explore why , and I tried to explore why I as down path as I , even though I peeled off . : Well , let 's get into that \u2014 you were on Trump for a bit . at one advised Pruitt in bid to become EPA administrator . So in terms of the question of \" Why We Did It , \" what can you say about the motivations of D.C. and of yourself at the time ? TM : Of 's a element to this power , but it not just , right ? I \" \" in particular is a of a . a of that to wield power in Washington , but power comes responsibility . has downsides . Being power great [ insiders ] . That is , I think , really a force for a lot of . They want to be the golf with Trump , Lindsey Graham 's case , or want to be in the back row of a room can go home for Thanksgiving and their family . is the drug in D.C. , one thing that I talked was these two elements of inertia identity . get into a career , you 're mid - level , then all of a sudden you start feel kind it . And then it 's like , well , what do I do now ? The Scott Pruitt situation was for . Trump won . This had been my whole life , being a Republican spokesperson or researcher . And I knew [ Pruitt ] . I did know that , he called me and he 's like , \" Hey , will you prep for job ? \" And I took just I a \u2014 I was like , \" I do n't what I 'm going . I going to have a job ? \" And then I also think that there is the identity element about this , which is \u2014 particularly in Washington , increasingly , in a concerning fashion , everybody who posts about politics on the internet \u2014 becomes of 's identity . [[ ]] In Washington , you people that \u2014 Republican is who they are . The that went to their wedding are all Republican operatives . The bar they go to the Republican bar . night Republican poker night . They a kids ' playgroup with other people who are Republican operatives .

The among Republican voters towards Democrats \u2014 and among Democrats towards Republicans \u2014 is huge . you 're saying that that partisanship the Republican class . TM : For sure . I this not a compliment to , by the way \u2014 this is a self - criticism \u2014 but I this as a little bit of kayfabe , which this wrestling term performative . Like , Hulk Hogan was really at Andre the Giant \u2014 I 'm showing age with that reference . it was fake . [[ ]] I was RNC as the spokesperson , my job basically to criticize . Obama campaign spokespeople at the time \u2014 LaBolt and Smith \u2014 friends of mine . , 'd go out and drink trash - talk each other . me , it was performative , and that 's how I was processing things . I was assuming that everyone was on level . And I came to find out is that they really were n't , and that this bitterness Obama , [ was ] element of to it for sure . But more that , I think for a the people political class , it was that he got treated , that he was the golden child in media and everyone loved him that did n't get as . [[ ]] then in the years , gets steroids . What I thought was performative between the parties , among , , many my colleagues became a driving , motivating force . [[ ]] guy said to directly , \" Tim , I 'm a white guy , all of nonsense and my wife friends calling for for Republicans and all this , all this heat I have to take , I 'm not up for jobs . it just leaves me no choice but just think about one or two I agree with [ the Trump administration ] on and just focus on . \" [[ ]] What I to find out is that guy really represented the private thoughts of a lot of Republicans . DK : 's another motivation that I to drill . There are categories of Republicans you call the messiahs and the junior messiahs . And these are people who told themselves and others that they administration jobs because they afraid otherwise \u2014 that , , least I can be the adult in the room . do not buy this argument . Why not ? : I do n't . I think it 's the toughest , because some level , lucky that H.R. McMaster was national security adviser instead of Michael Flynn ? Clearly . So hard to of begrudge H.R. McMaster on the one hand . [[ ]] other hand , their actions after they took job \u2014 all of those who that they into the White House because it was better them than someone else \u2014 actions kind of that they really other motivations . I say that because if it was true that these people went in because they just they this to country and that it was better in public service than , then they would have supported Biden in 2020 . But none them really came out , \" no , need to stop person . \" that have been the logical next of somebody that was going in really to save the country . [[ ]] DK : book , it feels like voters are right at the edge of the picture . I 'm thinking Iowa voters pushing John McCain in 2008 to be tougher immigration . Or you the formerly York , Elise Stefanik , who justified becoming Trumpier by saying , \" well , I 'm doing voters want . \" So question , you blame a lot of elites for falling with Trump \u2014 do towards voters ? [[ ]] I do n't . I 'm two minds about the voters . One that I do think are ones that are driving this . And book about the cowardice of the . The ruling would have been happy to along with a more benevolent person just their to power , they went along with the more dangerous and bigoted nativist route , because 's voters wanted . And OK , are voters that ? That a different book . I that the voters have a lot of reasons why they were upset . I mean , some bigots sure . I think the ruling class n't [ voters ' ] concerns . I write about the autopsy , which I worked on 2012 . I , a lot of Iraq , were mad about the hollowing - of their communities . n't anything try to address that . We did challenge Republican orthodoxies on any , Trump did . So I think it sense that those were attracted to . He was them . [[ ]] And the book is [ ] the class \u2014 media in . It should that that someone is every getting a text message a tweet or a about how their country being stolen from them , that they would want support radical ends to fix that . I to have grace towards people in my life that have swept up in this . And I think we have , in a representative democracy , obligation of the people at of funnel to resist 's impulses . did that . And is why those folks are the characters in my book . [[ ]] : You mentioned the autopsy you helped write \u2014 the report RNC released Mitt Romney lost 2012 , telling the have longer - term success . A lot of it working harder to to and voters . not fit that bill ... listener Rachel Gershman was our Facebook , \" Does the autopsy have any now ? \" TM : Not really . It has relevance as an what the Republican political , left devices , actually wanted . So I think that it interesting in regard . I think there a lot of think maybe an Republican Party have . Hillary Clinton was a flawed candidate , partially because of conservative complex \u2014 the hyperbole that she was targeted with \u2014 but she also had some flaws that she brought upon herself . [[ ]] a candidate that on immigration and believed in climate change \u2014 someone with Elise Stefanik 's 2014 platform believing should deal with climate change and supporting gay marriage , could that person have ? I maybe , , probably . But because Trump won , that this mindset within the Republican Party , after McCain and Romney , that this kind of , nativist , working class path the way for to win national elections again . [[ ]] DK : One other thing I to about is a gay Republican . You the tap support a just n't people like you . I 'm wondering if you could us how that affected you saw fellow Republicans do their own sort of dancing tried their allegiance to Trump . : I spent a of time thinking this because there are obviously limits to any parallel . But I think there are a lot parallels .

I think the happened is whole identity question that I talked about earlier . I was visible gay Republican spokesperson a while . So I been through \u2014 people seeing in a different way and having to deal with that kind identity . And so , I think it made it less hard for me do it Trump came around .

In December of 1972 , the astronaut Eugene Cernan left his footprints and \u2019s initials in the lunar . doing so , he became last man to set foot on the . Now , after years , humanity is going . in half century since Apollo 17 , a lot has in how we explore space \u2014 and we our place in it . those early missions were all run by , much of is the domain billionaires and companies . Commercial space travel has brought a of trips outside Earth \u2019s gravity , with tourism turning space into a vacation and something of a status . It \u2019s also the range of people go to space from the clean - cut white astronauts of the Apollo era . [[ ]] New visitors bring perspectives to space , and well change our to it . A ago , at 90 years old , William Shatner rode one Jeff Bezos \u2019s Origin spacecraft . But as told writer Koren , his time in space did n\u2019t line with optimism Star Trek \u2019s Captain Kirk . Koren and fellow Adam Harris discuss our changing relationship space on an episode of the podcast Atlantic . They also listen some of interview with Shatner . can hear their here : The following is a transcript of the episode : Adam Harris : This is . I Adam . Marina Koren : And I \u2019m Marina Koren . [[ ]] Harris : This week on the show , we space . We just heard some colleagues \u2019 kids talking about . As a parent myself , it feels like the of space are . One of the first T - shirts I remember buying for my daughter was a NASA T - . We blankets in our house and rocket ships on them . Is that recollection of childhood ? : Definitely . I had those glow - - the - stars on my ceiling . Occasionally one would fall and spook me , I got a set for my 3 - nephew . is a - to of wonder excitement for kids , for sure . [[ ]] Harris : And I should say that we are writers , but you are the one space beat . [[ ]] : Yes , I am Atlantic \u2019s space bureau chief . Harris : ( . ) And it \u2019s been a big year to be a reporter , right ? Koren : It has , yeah ! are definitely in this era of exploration . It \u2019s been 50 since the last human beings have set foot on the moon . 1972 was 17 , final landing . [[ ]] I think the universe a more familiar to now , because we \u2019ve come a long way . But something that \u2019s really different now is that you commercial companies that doing the that was traditionally done by governments . There SpaceX , Elon \u2019s , and , \u2019s venture . And 10 ago , if you someone that SpaceX will be launching people the International Space Station , have you . It seemed ridiculous , but this is the now . It feels like we in strange sci - fi where space travel is something you can buy . It \u2019s a type of vacation . And it \u2019s become a symbol a way . But now people can space and come and tell : \u201c Well , I \u2019ve been to space . I done that only about 600 or so people done the history of humankind . \u201d Harris : Before private travel , [ you think of people going space , ] you think of folks like or Buzz . \u2019s someone with military who studied to be astronaut their entire life . does it that that \u2019s no longer the type of person that \u2019s going into space ? Koren : I think that is to get , because that we \u2019ve heard spacefarers come from a specific group people . These were , often not , white men , trained in a certain culture that values \u201c the . \u201d stoic in face of something dangerous . But in this new era of commercial spaceflight , you \u2019re gon na be seeing a wide range of participants . There will hopefully be more women , more people color , people from groups , from different educational and socioeconomic backgrounds , and people with just a range of experiences . [[ ]] Harris : what are the stories that we \u2019ve about the in , right ? These astronauts , when come , what do they say space was like ? [[ ]] : Yeah , there a few common themes . So , when astronauts have gone to space and they \u2019ve seen Earth from that perspective , they have overcome with emotion at beauty of Earth . And it suddenly becomes very clear how thin our is . And that is the only thing that protects planet from else . They \u2019re struck by the fragility of the planet . And then something else also happens to a lot of astronauts they go to space \u2014 they feel a sense connectedness their fellow human down below . Because from space , you ca n\u2019t see any national borders . \u2019s just continents seas and . And so , many astronauts have home described these feelings . And stories are indicative a cognitive shift , almost , is known \u201c the overview effect . \u201d And I \u2019ve talked to who say they were taken by the borderless world and how beautiful , how it them feel like : Why are we at war ? Why is there conflict ? \u2019re one planet . made feel whole . [[ ]] I also talked to one academic who did an extensive study of \u2014 and she could n\u2019t reveal this astronaut \u2019s name to me \u2014 but said that this , when he into space , he look out window and convinced that was going to destroy itself in some - number years . And so experience could be profound and inspiring to person , but it could also actually make another feel despair . what happening now with space tourism and private spaceflight the people going into space have heard these stories of the overview . It \u2019s a thing . And so they \u2019re to feel a certain way when to space . They \u2019re expecting to have a profound change on their perspective of the world , and maybe on their personalities . And so I we \u2019re kind of over - that . And I have talked to a few professional NASA who agree . They worry that these companies and their pitches customers are overselling the effects the overview effect . It not a guarantee . It not a from the universe . It \u2019s something that a person and individually . And mileage vary . Harris : Yeah . you said these flights are a of minutes . Is that enough time to you ? Koren : That is a great . So I talked to White , the author who the \u201c the overview effect . \u201d He came up with it when he was on a \u2014 so , not in , but had a pretty \u2014 and he got to : generations humans who might be and working in have this distant view of all time . And they have these insights that regular earthbound people lack . he was surprised people who flying on Blue Origin and having a few of weightlessness were coming home and talking as if they had profound experience . They saying it changed them . And he was he thought that order to really get the hit of the effect , had to spend some in space . Weeks to in around Earth , or even all way on the . So , kind the literature that we here . And I \u2019s what \u2019s going to in this era of commercial , you are going to have who not the Apollo astronauts . And they going to be with stories and really widening the overview effect we become as a public . [[ ]] And the future participants wo n\u2019t be restricted by some of the constraints that the professional were . If you were a professional astronaut you went space and did n\u2019t have a great time , I do think could say that once came back from space , because that could future flight assignments . had to a certain response on your way home . And so I think we \u2019re to hear some of the most honest stories of spaceflight that \u2019ve ever heard before . Harris : Is the effect real ? If we only have this limited pool of stories pull from , is that theory a thing ? Have all of folks who have gone up shared that ? [[ ]] Koren : That a great question . I think the way overview effect , it becomes like this mystical , magical . Astronauts revered people . Even when I \u2019ve , when they into the room in their flight suits their on fabric , you ca help but feel intimidated . Because you think : , this has seen something that I \u2019ve never seen . [[ ]] And so think the overview effect and the that people should have in space as something that the universe gives us . But it actually a phenomenon . has shaped by a certain group of working under a set of pressures who wanted to make sure that they could again . they could n\u2019t say anything outrageous . And overview effect came out of a certain time and place . Many of these stories come from the midst of the race , the middle the Cold War . That definitely shapes a person perspective . So I would say that seeing Earth from is not a one - size - fits - reaction . Harris : What are some the that stuck because they may have differed this idea an overview effect ? : I with Shatner about his space flight . He was 90 years old he took that trip . I recorded my with Shatner . And he was a , but not for the reasons that \u2019re used to hearing . [[ ]] Harris : So you got talk to Captain Kirk ? Koren : I , yes ! I will admit : I have never seen Star before . [[ ]] Harris : So have a reporter who never seen Star ? Koren : ( Laughs . ) I have . you \u2019ve it , right ? Harris : I have seen Trek . playing pretty frequently on our TVs I a kid . My rarely missed episodes or reruns . [ But ] for people like Marina do n\u2019t know who Captain is : He the of the starship Enterprise on Star Trek the 1960s . The original captain . And he was this really optimistic figure \u2014 this really of classical hero . [ But ] what Shatner have to say about going to space ? Actually there ? Koren : When I to him , it was about a year his experience , and the flight still fresh in his mind . I asked him how he was a year out , and he dove right into a Shatner - esque monologue about going to . William Shatner : We emerged from the film of that surrounds , and we weightless . I got out of my - point harness and my way the window . I saw a wake air . Like a submarine might in the . And then I looked to , which was facing . I looked up there , I nothing but blank , space . The blackness overwhelming . immediate thought was : God , \u2019s death . And then I looked , and I could see with great clarity the of the circumference line of the Earth . of the desert that I had just left , was beige . The whiteness the clouds . blueness of the air . And those three in deference to the blackness \u2014 I was overwhelmed by the sense of death and overwhelmed by the sense - nurturing by the Earth . Koren : When came back from quick space , he \u2019s standing outside the capsule ; there \u2019s other people . Jeff is there . Bezos is popping champagne a frat boy . And Shatner there , super still . [[ ]] Shatner : I did know what I was feeling , but I was weeping , I n\u2019t know why . Everybody else was celebrating . It took me a couple hours sitting by myself to understand that what I feeling was . And the . Koren : He is overcome with . He is weeping , then starts saying how he was just taken aback by blackness of , the ugliness of space , how looked like . So Shatner was super , super honest about his experience . when I talked to him , he said that that grief was still with . Earth was beautiful and gleaming and delicate from that perspective , but it reminded him of that \u2019s wrong on the particularly made him think about how unstoppable change feels . [[ ]] And so for , this in many ways a negative experience . And Shatner cry when we about it , because the experience is so in his about and the really changed in the year he went space . So that grief was still with him . : was experience from what he may that he feel after going up space ? Koren : He that he expected to and just be reminded of beautiful and wonderful this planet is . I to be reaffirming a positive way . And it \u2019s interesting to think of man who a character big space in real life going , and his initial emotional reaction that is grief and all kinds of negative emotion . I think what other astronauts is : When have gone space , have felt an overwhelming to care the planet . You that is all is . is all we know , at least . And if this is our one home this floating of in the void , then should care of it . And so , you know , there a case be that go up space , feeling will trickle down and lead to some type of meaningful Earth . Harris : If somebody gives a ticket on a $ 20 flight , you \u2019re not na be able say , \u201c Well , that was n\u2019t exactly what I expected to . \u201d But Shatner able to something different . Why was his from others who to space and came back down just , \u201c , was great . , Jeff , for putting this \u201d ? Koren : I , William Shatner is William Shatner , right ? He years space flight . He \u2019s Captain Kirk . I think he does owe Jeff anything . Yes , Bezos his ticket , and that \u2019s . But someone like William going into come and say what they want , because the public looks at in a way . If a very wealthy person decides to comp the tickets for an electrician [ or ] for a , and they go up and come down , they speak their very freely ? I do . Harris : Say a billionaire called you and was : \u201c Hey , Marina , love your stories . You go to space ? \u201d Would you go if you got the opportunity ? : Oh , well , there would some about journalistic . But would I ever go to space ? I \u2019m gon na say no . Harris : Really ? [[ ]] Koren : is risky . You never what might happen , what could happen . I n\u2019t die the job not having my . Like , if something happens \u2014 I somehow incapacitated , I come back and I ca n\u2019t write the story \u2014 will haunt me . ( Laughs . ) freak me . I ca n\u2019t that we can get off ground land back in one piece . And , you know , space is not at that yet , but maybe someday will . And that pretty to think . Harris : Actually , to point , people at high altitudes day . Do think that there a future where spaceflight is going to feel sort commonplace as taking a to ? [[ ]] Koren : I think that future is possible . I think what have be careful is making too many promises . If you to Elon Musk about spaceflight right now , they \u2019re that this future happening , , next week . And I do n\u2019t think that future will happen that . It \u2019s true that more than are going have the to go to space now . I \u2019m if in my lifetime there are going spaceships full going to the moon . I , might be . SpaceX and Elon Musk , really hard to make that reality . \u2019s - generation moon rocket reach orbit as early next year . SpaceX has already sold tickets to people to go on a trip around . These things are happening . quickly they become reality , I know . 50 years from when a years from the - program anniversary , maybe it will feel a bit more , a ride . [[ ]] : Is some of fading from space , or travel ? Are we sort of becoming desensitized to space travel ? first couple flights , was all 24 - hour . They broadcast of . But that sort slowed down . Are we sort of becoming desensitized to the awe and wonder of space travel ? Koren : I that \u2019s possible . I think of Earthrise picture taken by the Apollo 8 crew in 1968 . That picture was mind - to people . \u2019d never seen like this . Fifty , I think our are so spoiled special effects that I if the of Earth space that shocking . Especially when you have so orbit and coming back and posting on Instagram like : \u201c \u2019s what looks like . \u201d I do wonder if we seen so much incredible CGI , our might be impressed by view people in the 1960s . But I also do know if that some dumb take . [[ ]] Harris : like if somebody , they like : \u201c This is n\u2019t Interstellar looked like . \u201d Koren : ( . ) \u201c Where \u2019s the ? \u201d Harris : \u201c I expecting a wormhole . \u201d And all is , as Shatner said , this great blackness of space .", "label": "human"}

There are four main categories the supply chain under this : Capital makers , pure - play foundries fabs , fabless designers , and integrated device . equipment companies \u2014 as Applied Materials ( AMAT ) , Lam Research ( LRCX ) , Holdings ( ASML ) and KLA Corporation ( KLAC ) \u2014 machines used in of semiconductors . Pure - foundries , or fabs , companies with factories that fabricate ( manufacture ) chips designed by other firms ( some designers have their but will touch that ) . In monstrous facilities , you will find the capital by the capital . That alone should provide some insight into the money , because when a foundry is or built from scratch , a good of spending is going go buying equipment from the capital equipment makers . When hear on a call from a capital expenditure , that 're hearing is on demand revenue for capital equipment makers . Players in foundry include companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Company ( TSM ) , often to as just TSMC , GlobalFoundries ( ) . Fabless designers generally outsource the chips they draw up to foundries . Again , start to flow , as guidance from a designer high demand \u2014 and therefore , a need for a greater number chips . course , the more chips a company needs , the greater order value it will place a foundry player such as . Fabless designers include our holdings Nvidia , , Marvell Qualcomm . Since these companies n't need to expensive facilities , they run a agile - light business . They do n't have concern themselves with the need lay out significant capital in to ensure ability manufacture the most cutting - edge chips . Finally , integrated device companies and manufacture own in - house , essentially designers with their own foundries . Players in this Intel ( INTC ) , Micron Technology ( ) , ON ( ON ) and Texas Instruments ( ) . Semiconductor supply chain Understanding the structure the semiconductor can help to better understand how money flows through the industry \u2014 and therefore , help members and corporate updates to make informed decisions when investing the industry . Here some examples . If we know that capital is in foundries , what we really know from a financial perspective is that capital ( capex ) made the level are directly tied capital maker . So , when TSMC discusses capex on its conference call , it our jobs as investors to read those comments demand for Materials and . Nvidia discusses supply demand dynamics , it provides insight into what will need from a - type manufacturing facility . there is an inventory , the last thing Nvidia wants is more chips ; that means orders TSMC and vice versa . course , in that same of thinking , when cloud providers such as holdings ( ) , ( ) , Alphabet ( ) investments , means they need chips . companies ' capex linked at . We saw at Meta ( ) announced that 2023 capex spending would increase 2022 due to data center investments . The stock due to Wall Street believes to be undisciplined spending . However , it provided a to the semiconductor stocks that would Meta spending as revenue . If hear the economy and the cloud providers say they want \" digest past , \" they are really saying that they spent a lot money and going to pump the breaks on additional investments in capacity . In , you need to say , \" OK , cloud providers are slowing , which means less demand for Nvidia . If is going to see less for next quarters it may need to reduce orders TSMC . And if TSMC is to receive fewer , it may capex \u2014 and as a result , for Lam Research equipment decline the near - term . \" Of course , there are a moving timing the flow is incredibly . But that is how needs to think at a high level . Remaining cutting edge requires always looking ahead , and companies must balance spending slowdowns continued investment in term , which is why gauging stages of semiconductor investment cycle is difficult . Nvidia may be seeing a glut 30 - series chips , but the company stills need work on ramping production of its 40 - series to be ready once the inventory is worked . not be as much for 7 - nanometer chips , but it needs to be in a position to start producing 5 - nanometer and 3 - nanometer chips after that . The company ca n't stop spending entirely . Without going into it too , the smaller chip size , the more densely packed . This results in more speed , less power consumption , and less , which would also effort / power consumption / cost to . Types semiconductor chips because two may be lumped together based on their places within the foundry business model does not mean should be viewed peers or even competitors . Despite both being fabless designers , , which focuses heavily on connectivity solutions , should not be likened to fellow designer Nvidia , main is on graphics processing units ( ) . Here is a high - level overview of the different kinds chips that should members better understand some of the around discussing this industry and a - off point those want to research on their own . Memory : The main categories memory chips are NAND and DRAM . Both markets essentially oligopolies \u2014 a few players the supply . Samsung , Micron SK pretty own the DRAM . In NAND , Samsung Micron also players , in addition to Kioxia ( formerly Toshiba ) , Western Digital ( WDC ) , . NAND generally refers to a type of memory whereas DRAM for dynamic random memory . As you can tell , this industry can get very technical , confusing , and frustrating very fast for those not familiar terms . Flash ( again , ) refers a type non - volatile storage medium . - volatile means that your data wo be lost once the goes off . common use for that you may have seen the you purchased a computer is in - state drives ( SSD ) , all the files are stored your computer . To really simplify , when you hear NAND or memory , think of the - state drive storage on a PC . ( Now you asking an is . Basically , it 's the device is hard drives ( HDDs ) seen older computers . HDDs have a spinning on which data written , have no moving parts , them faster and secure \u2014 though you will pay up for that of course . is what a volatile memory , meaning it will data so long as there is power . Oftentimes you hear the RAM see memory listed your PC specs , what is being to . flash , which stores data and over long even the power off , DRAM \" working \" that is upon only when a computer processor to perform a given . The more intense the , the more DRAM you need , which is why a computer used for video editing or gaming require more than one simply surf the web check emails . Microprocessors : The three main processors to know are the central unit ( ) , the graphics unit ( GPU ) , and data processing unit ( DPU ) . The CPU like those made and AMD , which essentially have a duopoly \u2014 two players control the \u2014 is the brains of a . is responsible for retrieving instructions / , those instructions , and sending them along in order have an carried out deliver the desired . As Nvidia put in a past post , the is , the GPU is the . GPUs specialized than CPUs and taking on tasks once . Whereas a CPU will process sequentially , a GPU will break down a complex into many small tasks and perform at . This is why we seeing their prevalence in . While the remains essential , adding a GPU for acceleration in data processing . With more being transmitted , stored , processed ever before \u2014 as cloud computing adopted and work on deep learning and artificial advances \u2014 speed crucial . The GPU is essentially a duopoly by and AMD . A DPU like made Marvell and Nvidia is a newer type processor that is as become more complex . Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a blog post , \" This is going represent of the three pillars of . CPU is for general - purpose computing , the GPU is for accelerated computing , and the DPU , which moves data around the data center , data processing . \" Everything else : To be sure , there are many different types of chips that outside of the memory or microprocessor classifications . Examples include those for 5 G , WiFi , Bluetooth , radiofrequency chips , near field communication chips ( ) , application - specific integrated chips ( ASICs ) , so on . These chips made by Qualcomm , , Broadcom ( ) , Semiconductor , NXP Semiconductor ( ) , and others . Rather than a dive each one \u2014 beyond the scope of this foundry industry analysis \u2014 we simply want highlight that the term semiconductor applies to a broad array of designed for different to different end markets that each have their own demand drivers . Bottom line When in the chip , it is to understand a target company 's exposure . do necessarily need an engineering level of understanding of the work or are , but you need to have an idea of end market the into who the customers are . From there , you can begin to the end markets better understand demand trends . Remember , at the end of the day , your primary question and the goal of your research to understand where the is flowing . That 's true for all investments but especially so when to semiconductors . Because they are everywhere but almost seen , it 's not as easy as saying , \" Apple is going to sell a lot of iPhones this quarter . \" Chances are nobody will be around the Thanksgiving table talking about they are for the next - memory and microprocessors . , when you do about that new gadget everyone ca n't wait get their hands on , ask yourself , \" semiconductors are sitting inside it ? \" Despite being a boom / bust , do tend to over the years , and demand throughout the cycle increases thanks to the prevalence of semiconductors in our daily lives , more chips into each device smaller and smaller factors . The iPhone , for example , did n't always have light detection ranging ( LiDAR ) , it does now support new that means another chip packed in the handset . While do see secular growth on longer , the suffers from brutal boom and bust . Supply and demand drives all industries , but the semiconductor industry in particular is incredibly sensitive to it . Chipmakers have significant power when demand outstrips , as we 've seen recent ; new cars will sit in the lot collecting dust manufacturers wait for a key chip . But we see that pricing power on a dime once , leading to less power gluts that must be addressed before the cycle can kick . ( Cramer Charitable Trust is AMD , NVDA , MRVL , , AMZN , GOOGL , and .

[[ ]] The is n\u2019t the only , however . Going more than a century , military has found multiple uses the same old gear . Here are three the US brought \u201c obsolete \u201d and tactics to take on . [[ ]] Gatling The Gatling gun was one first truly successful machine guns . Designed by American inventor Richard 1861 , the weapon used a barrel with chambers that could fire off multiple rounds in a short amount of time . It became important weapon in the War , it continued to service during the Indian Wars and later conflicts such as - American War . [[ ]] It also experienced a resurrection in the early years of the Vietnam War . by this the Gatling gun had been replaced by weapons like M2 Browning machine , the US military its value providing fire and decided to resurrect it . Initially with a shield protect the , it was later replaced by an open - top mount that offered greater visibility . The The 1911 one of the most iconic handguns ever made . It was designed firearms inventor John Moses Browning in 1911 and was the standard - issue of the US military until was replaced by the Beretta in 1985 . Though the 1911 was phased out of military service , it never left the US arsenal . The pistol saw a resurgence during the war in Afghanistan when Special Operations realized it still a reliable powerful weapon . The 1911 was dusted off and with modern features such as extended beavertail grip safeties modifications , allowing the to remain in service for the better part 21st century . [[ ]] The Dogs War Military dogs been used for centuries in a of , from sentry duty to search and . But perhaps the famous of a dog in action German shepherd Rin Tin , who first during War I before on to star in numerous films . Dogs remained important part US armed forces , and they saw a new resurgence in Afghanistan . One particularly notable is Cairo , a Belgian Malinois military working dog who in raid resulted in the death of Osama bin 2011 . Dogs like Cairo have proven invaluable to US forces in the East , aiding in , tracking , other operations . [[ ]] In Conclusion The US military is of most capable forces in the world , and has itself time be able to to the needs of modern warfare . Weapons such as the Gatling gun , Colt 1911 , military working dogs seen a resurgence in and have proven to be more than capable of taking on new enemies . As long as the US remains an active participant in the world military conflicts , is certain that more of these \u201c obsolete \u201d weapons and tactics will called back service .", "label": "machine"}
