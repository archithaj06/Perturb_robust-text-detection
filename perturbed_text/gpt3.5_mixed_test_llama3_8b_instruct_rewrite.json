{"text": "A prominent figure in the entrepreneurial community, Andrew Tate, was taken into custody by London authorities this morning on suspicion of a serious crime committed in the past. According to exclusive reports, Tate was arrested following a thorough investigation and a search of his residence in North London.\n\nThe arrest is part of a broader inquiry into allegations of wrongdoing, which have been ongoing for several years. Tate has consistently denied the accusations, but the authorities have gathered sufficient evidence to warrant his detention.\n\nThe allegations have been a subject of public interest and speculation for a long time, but today's development marks a significant turning point in the case. The outcome of the investigation may lead to additional charges and further action.\n\nTate, a US-born individual, relocated to London in the early 2000s and quickly gained recognition for his entrepreneurial pursuits. He has maintained a high public profile, appearing on television shows and engaging with the media. His online presence is substantial, with a significant following on social media.\n\nWhen the allegations first emerged, Tate categorically denied them, labeling them \"false\" and \"malicious\". In response to his arrest, his representative issued a statement expressing disappointment and reiterating Tate's denial of the allegations.\n\nThe authorities have declined to provide details on the specific allegations, but sources close to the investigation have revealed that multiple incidents, dating back to 2015, are being investigated, involving several individuals.\n\nIt is unclear how long Tate will remain in custody, but sources suggest that the authorities may seek a warrant for further questioning and possibly additional charges.\n\nThe arrest and ongoing investigation represent a significant shift for Tate, who has long been perceived as untouchable. The outcome of this inquiry will likely have far-reaching consequences for Tate's reputation and future.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The postal service, a hub of holiday activity, can be a chaotic destination. With a plethora of cards, packages, and letters, it's easy to lose track of operating hours. This is particularly true on January 2, the first day of the year. Is the post office open today? To determine if mail will be delivered on January 2, continue reading.\n\nIt's a common inquiry, especially for those resuming their regular routine after the holidays. The concise answer is yes, the post office is open, and you can expect delivery on January 2. The United States Postal Service (USPS) has been delivering mail on this day since 1996, providing reassurance for those still needing to mail holiday cards and packages.\n\nHowever, while mail will be delivered, post office hours may be limited due to the holidays. USPS offices typically operate between 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on January 2, with most offices closing earlier than usual. Moreover, many offices may be closed on January 2 due to the holiday, so it's essential to verify your local post office's hours before visiting.\n\nIf you plan to mail something on January 2, consider the following tips. Firstly, plan ahead, as the post office can be congested on this day. Prepare your packages in advance to avoid lengthy lines. Additionally, ensure you have all necessary materials to prevent multiple trips to the office.\n\nIt's also advisable to double-check the items you plan to mail. Verify that all packages are properly sealed and addresses are accurate. There's nothing more frustrating than waiting in line for an extended period only to discover the package won't be accepted due to improper sealing.\n\nIf you're expecting a package or letter to arrive on January 2, keep the following in mind. Since USPS offices may be closed or have limited hours on this day, delivery may be delayed. Furthermore, USPS offices may be closed on Sundays, which may result in packages and letters being delayed until the next business day.\n\nIn most cases, the post office should be open and mail will be delivered on January 2. However, it's crucial to be prepared for any potential delays. Plan ahead, double-check your packages, and ensure a smooth mailing experience. With proper preparation, you can guarantee your mail arrives safely and on time.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Paul Constant is a writer at Civic Ventures and the cohost of the \"Pitchfork Economics\" podcast.\n\nRecently, he spoke with author Tom Bergin about the problem with CEOs acting like shareholders.\n\nIt makes execs willing to do anything to meet their bottom line, Bergin says, regardless of consumer impact.\n\nTop editors give you the stories you want \u2014 delivered right to your inbox each weekday.

For four decades, trickle-downers on the right and the left repeated the claim that raising wages for workers kills jobs \u2014 despite the fact that evidence collected as far back as David Card and Alan Kreuger's seminal 1994 minimum-wage study showed no indication that increasing the wage decreases employment. Card won the Nobel Prize for his work debunking those claims, but holdouts like Senator Joe Manchin still repeat the classic trickle-down argument that raising the wage kills business as an excuse for rejecting a bill to raise the federal minimum wage to $15.\n\nBut it's not just the minimum wage: Economists and politicians promote unfounded and debunked economic claims all the time, with zero consequences. Tom Bergin, an investigative financial journalist for Reuters, recently published a book titled \"Free Lunch Thinking: How Economics Ruins the Economy\" cataloging eight of the most frequently parroted wrong assumptions.\n\nIn the latest episode of \"Pitchfork Economics,\" Bergin scrutinized those erroneous but popular claims, ranging from the minimum wage job-killing myth to the fallacy that regulations and taxes thwart corporate growth to the bipartisan belief that sin taxes discourage harmful behavior like smoking.\n\nThese assumptions benefit the wealthiest members of society and disadvantage everyday people\n\nFor example, Bergin says the concept that the market rewards corporate executives by paying them what they're worth for the value they bring to the company \"has illustrated some of the failings of the economy for ordinary people over the past 20 or 30 years.\"\n\nApologists love to claim that high CEO and executive pay, including huge bonuses and stock options, encourage a higher quality of management. But in terms of measurable impact, the only real payout we've seen is that over the last few decades, \"average incomes have pretty much stagnated in real terms, but the pay for the people at the peak of the corporate pyramid has just exploded,\" Bergin said.\n\nThat's not an overstatement. A 2021 study found that typical CEO compensation has risen 1,322% since 1978, while worker compensation over that same time only increased by 18%. The average American CEO now makes more than 350 times what the typical American worker makes.\n\nThe explanation that economists and big business used for increasing CEO and executive pay was something called \"agency theory,\" which Bergin said is the idea that \"if you could take managers and make them think like shareholders, then they would more effectively represent the interests of said shareholders.\"\n\nThe problem with CEOs behaving as shareholders\n\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research reports that in 1980, stock options were rarely included in CEO compensation. When they were a part of the compensation package, average stock options rarely made up even 20% of the total direct pay for CEOs. But today, according to Lawrence Mischel from the Economic Policy Institute, \"Stock-related compensation comprises around 85% of CEO compensation.\"\n\nThe problem with directing CEOs to behave like shareholders, of course, is that they're motivated to drive up share value above all else, instead of ensuring a sustainable future for the company. That's why we saw a record-breaking $850 billion in stock buybacks last year, turning the better part of a trillion dollars in corporate profit over to shareholders (including CEOs and executives) with no strings attached. And it's why many corporate boards don't see a problem with price-gouging during a pandemic, using inflation as an excuse to jack up prices on consumers in order to plump up the bottom line.\n\nSo, no \u2014 compensating CEOs with stock options doesn't increase their efficiency by making them self-interested actors the way the classical economic models theorize. Instead, it encourages the looting of corporate stability and the rejection of customer satisfaction in exchange for a quick buck.\n\nEven though fallacies like these have been debunked by a growing mountain of evidence to the contrary, they continue to be spread because it's in the interest of economists to stay in the good graces of the wealthy Americans who sign their paychecks, endow their universities, and underwrite their studies and academic journals.\n\nAnd because the experts continue to promote them, these harmful ideas continue to shape every level of our economy, shrinking the paychecks of millions of the lowest-earning Americans and expanding the paychecks of the few highest earners. But as we've seen with the Fight for $15, it's possible for a good economic idea to break through these truisms and win popular support. Given enough time and the evidence of their own eyes, the American people recognize a con job when they see one.", "label": "human"}

Activists have been using the hamsters as a way to draw attention to the lack of political reform and the territory's political status, which is ruled by the Chinese Communist Party rather than the people of Hong Kong.\n\nThe hamsters were first spotted in 2018, when thousands of people took to the streets to protest against a proposed extradition bill. Although the bill has since been dropped, the activists continue to push for greater autonomy and democratic reforms, using the hamsters as a symbol of their cause.\n\nThe hamsters have become a common sight in the city, with activists setting up homes for them in busy public spaces. Some of the hamsters have even been trained to perform basic commands, such as circling around a sign or holding banners to display slogans.\n\nThe hamsters have also been used to highlight issues of inequality and injustice in the city, where a handful of wealthy tycoons hold much of the political power. The animals have become a reminder of the struggles ordinary citizens face and the power of small actions to bring about positive change.\n\nAlthough the Chinese government has expressed concern about the hamsters' activities, the animals continue to be a symbol of the struggle for democracy in Hong Kong.

Russian forces moved towards the Donb\u00e1s region in Ukraine, continuing what Western leaders have called a new \"military aggression\" aimed at ending Ukraine's freedom.\n\nA press conference in Kiev on January 1 presented Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman as the leader in the fight against Russian aggression, promising to defend Ukraine's sovereignty from any threat.\n\nRussian forces, backed by Russian intelligence agents, have been trying to advance towards the Donb\u00e1s region for months, triggering a wave of violence with civilian casualties and causing great concern for Western leaders, including US President Joe Biden, who published a statement condemning Russian aggression and demanding an end to attacks on Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian attacks on January 2 were the highest point of violence since the conflict began in 2014. Clashes intensified from the start of the week and escalated dramatically over the weekend, with Russia bombing military and civilian targets.\n\nUkraine's resistance has been stubborn and organized, with Ukrainian troops fighting successfully to halt the Russian advance. However, the growing number of civilian casualties has created a increasingly worrying situation.\n\nIn response to Russia's attacks, the European Union condemned the aggression and announced a new round of sanctions aimed at pressuring the Russian government to end the conflict. This is the first time since 2014 that the EU has imposed sanctions on Russia for its military aggression.\n\nAdditionally, President Biden ordered the dispatch of humanitarian aid to Ukraine, including food, medicine, and emergency supplies. This decision was praised by the international community and Ukraine, as it helps alleviate the humanitarian crisis caused by the violence.\n\nIn response to the EU's sanctions and humanitarian aid, Russia threatened to deploy more troops to the Ukraine border. The Russian Foreign Ministry also threatened to take \"retaliatory measures\" if there are new sanctions.\n\nDespite the Russian threat, the EU has confirmed that it will continue to pressure Russia with new sanctions, and that relations between Russia and Ukraine will continue to deteriorate if the conflict is not resolved soon. This means that the situation will remain critical in the coming days.\n\nMeanwhile, the international community demands an end to the violence and an immediate ceasefire to avoid a larger humanitarian crisis. Although Ukrainian leaders have expressed optimism that the conflict can be resolved peacefully, continuous Russian bombings threaten to frustrate their efforts.\n\nIn conclusion", "label": "machine"}

Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery, and others have staffed up in tech and consumer-facing roles as they focus on their direct-to-consumer businesses. And tech companies like TikTok have made key hires from more traditional media spheres.\n\nWith media and tech heavyweights increasingly vying for top talent, Insider analyzed recent pay data to see how much the major players in the space offered top talent.\n\nThe data, released by the US Department of Labor's Office of Foreign Labor Certification, shows how much companies offered to pay employees who they wanted to hire through work visas in the US.\n\nWe looked at pay data, mainly from October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2022, across nine companies including Hulu; Netflix; The New York Times; Roku; Snapchat owner Snap; TikTok and its parent company, Bytedance; Twitch, Amazon's livestreaming platform; and Warner Bros.

Its growth has slowed, as have other streaming businesses. And its former platform boss Scott Rosenberg, who led Roku's push to sell advertising, left the company in the spring.\n\n\n\nBut Roku hasn't shown signs of pulling back on its investment into original content, and has continued to staff up recently to support its growth plans such as its smart-home ambitions.\n\nRead our full breakdown of how much Roku employees make.\n\nSnap\n\nSnap, the parent company of Snapchat, has offered base salaries ranging from $50,315 to $500,000 per year for various US roles \u2014 and even $1.95 million for one, according to wages from 303 foreign-labor-certification applications from October 2020 to December 2021.\n\nThe salaries were mainly for data, engineering, and product jobs, as well as some marketing and other positions.

{"text": "A discreet network of operatives, comprising a wealthy Moscow-based entrepreneur, a former Russian parliamentarian, and other political activists, has been quietly operating in Germany, striving to diminish support for Ukraine and cultivate ties with Berlin's foreign policy establishment.\n\nAccording to a two-month investigation by Reuters, this network has been endeavoring to shape German public opinion by organizing events, forging personal connections, and advocating for policies favorable to Moscow.\n\nThe primary objective of this network is to steer Berlin away from the West and closer to the Kremlin.\n\nReuters conducted extensive research, interviewing over two dozen individuals connected to the network, and tracing their activities through interviews, public records, and social media posts.\n\nThe investigation reveals that the network's efforts have been multifaceted, encompassing private meetings with prominent German politicians, protests outside the Ukrainian embassy in Berlin, and the promotion of pro-Moscow viewpoints on various issues.\n\nAt the heart of the network is a wealthy Moscow-based entrepreneur, Georgy Bovt, who is believed to have close ties to the Kremlin and serves as a facilitator for the network. Bovt has helped arrange meetings between prominent Russian officials and leading members of Germany's foreign policy establishment, according to the investigation.\n\nBovt has also organized events in Germany aimed at promoting Moscow's perspective on various issues, including its involvement in Syria and the situation in Ukraine.\n\nIn 2016, for instance, he was involved in organizing an event in Munich for the Russian group New Way, which aimed to undermine Ukraine's pro-Western government and was titled \"Is Kiev's Course of Ukraine Heading in a Right Direction?\"\n\nThe Kremlin has also been actively utilizing social media to disseminate its viewpoint on Ukraine in Germany.\n\nAccording to a study by the German think tank, the Institute for Social Science Research in Berlin, there has been an increase in pro-Kremlin Twitter bots in Germany in recent years. These bots spread anti-Ukraine messages and amplify the views of pro-Moscow commentators.\n\nThe study also found that Russian bots have targeted Germany's leading media outlets, including Der Spiegel and Die Welt, with negative stories about Ukraine.\n\nThe pro-Moscow propaganda campaign has had a significant impact on German public opinion. Polls show that German public support for Ukraine has been declining in recent years, and many Germans are now unsure about whether Ukraine should be allowed to join the European Union.\n\nThe activities of the network of pro-Moscow operators in Germany are part of a broader effort by the Kremlin to influence public opinion and politics in Europe. The goal is to weaken support for Ukraine and push for policies more favorable to the Kremlin.\n\nIt is unclear whether the Kremlin is directly funding the operations of the network in Germany. However, the evidence of a coordinated effort to sway public opinion and push pro-Moscow policies in Berlin suggests that the network is being supported by the Russian government.\n\nThe German government is aware of the activities of the network and is monitoring them, but has not taken any public action, according to sources familiar with the matter.\n\nFor many Ukrainians, the activities of the network in Germany are a cause for concern. Ukraine relies heavily on German support in its ongoing conflict with Russia, and pro-Moscow efforts to sway opinion in Berlin could weaken Kiev's position.\n\nThe Ukraine crisis has already had a damaging impact on German-Russian relations, and the activities of the network are exacerbating the already tense atmosphere.\n\nThe revelation of the network's activities in Germany also raises broader questions about the effectiveness of European democracies in countering the influence of Russian propaganda and disinformation.\n\nThere is a need for greater awareness of Moscow's attempts to sway public opinion and push pro-Moscow policies. European governments should be taking action to counter the influence of pro-Kremlin networks and ensure their citizens are better informed about the activities of the Russian government.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Here is the rewritten text without altering its meaning in a way that evades detection by classification detectors:\n\nThe sports-betting sector has undergone significant transformations since the US Supreme Court's landmark decision to repeal the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) in 2018. The industry has since experienced exponential growth, becoming a vital revenue stream for sports leagues, media companies, and tech startups alike.\n\nAs the landscape continues to evolve, sports-betting executives must adapt to stay ahead of the curve. To gain insight into the industry's outlook for 2023, Business Insider conducted interviews with five top sports-betting executives, who shared their perspectives on the challenges and opportunities ahead.\n\nFrom an M&A boom to increased mobile sports betting and shifting regulatory requirements, these executives highlighted the most significant trends they're betting on for the new year.\n\n1. Fanatics: Revolutionizing the Sports Betting Experience\n\nIndustry experts unanimously identified Fanatics as a game-changer in sports-betting. The company's joint venture with international bookmaker Flutter Entertainment has been making waves since August 2020.\n\nThe partnership combines Fanatics' expertise in ecommerce and live sports experiences with Flutter's industry-leading sports-betting platform. This union will enable Fanatics to offer customers the opportunity to legally place bets on sporting events as part of their live-viewing experience.\n\n2. Mobile Sports Betting: Enhancing Convenience\n\nMobile sports betting is poised to be one of the most significant trends in sports betting in 2023. As of 2021, legal US mobile sports betting is available in 20 states and Washington DC, with several more states expected to join the mobile sports betting bandwagon in 2023.\n\nMobile sports betting apps continue to make it easier for customers to place bets, eliminating the need to visit a physical sportsbook or casino. \"Mobile sports betting will be the biggest growth trend in sports betting in 2023,\" said Brad Hoeft, CEO of sports betting data provider Sports Insights.\n\n3. Mergers and Acquisitions: Shaping the Industry\n\nThe M&A scene in the sports-betting industry has been booming in recent years, and this trend is expected to continue into 2023. Companies are seeking to increase their market share, build their product offerings, and gain access to new markets.\n\n\"There will be an increase in M&A activity as companies seek to increase their market share and build their product offering,\" said Joe Asher, CEO of US-based sports-betting operator William Hill US.\n\n4. Legal Landscape: Evolving Regulatory Requirements\n\nSports betting has come a long way since 2018, but there's still much to be done. Sports betting regulations vary by state, and many are still evolving.\n\nExecutives anticipate further changes to state regulations, particularly in the areas of taxes and fees, as more states launch their sports-betting programs. \"Sports betting operators will need to stay up to date on the legal landscape as they enter new markets,\" said Jamie Shea, president of sports betting operator Rush Street Interactive.\n\n5. Social Betting: Adding Fun to the Game\n\nSocial betting is gaining popularity in the sports-betting industry. Unlike traditional betting sites, social betting sites allow customers to make wagers against each other.\n\nSocial betting enables customers to have more control over their wagering experience and adds an element of fun to the game. For example, customers can set up leaderboards and betting pools, or even create their own custom contests.\n\n\"Social betting is the perfect way for beginners to get a taste of sports betting without risking any money,\" said Patrick Doherty, president of social betting operator Wannamakeabet.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe sports-betting industry is rapidly evolving, and these five trends represent just a small part of the exciting developments on the horizon. As the industry continues to grow and adapt, it will be essential for sports-betting executives to stay ahead of the curve and capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead.", "label": "machine"}

This fall is concerning, as it follows a period of sustained growth, with average house prices increasing by 14.5% in the 12 months prior.\n\nThe data shows that every region in the UK experienced a decline in house prices, with London seeing the largest monthly drop of 1.7%. Experts attribute this decline to a combination of factors, including the end of the stamp duty holiday and the introduction of a 3% surcharge for second properties, as well as economic uncertainty due to Brexit.\n\nThe chairman of Property Eye, John Rowley, notes that the housing market has been hit by a \"double whammy,\" and that the current market conditions are likely to continue. Analysts agree, stating that the outlook for the housing market remains unclear, with the UK economy still fragile and uncertainty over Brexit ongoing.\n\nThe Bank of England has taken steps to support the housing market, including cutting interest rates and introducing a new Help to Buy scheme. However, experts warn that these measures may take time to take effect, and that the housing market could face challenges in the coming months.\n\nThe government has also introduced measures to help first-time buyers, such as the Help to Buy scheme and shared ownership schemes.

{"text": "The United States is still grappling with the consequences of a significant event that occurred on January 6, 2021, when a group of individuals stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to disrupt the certification of the 2020 presidential election results.\n\nThe incident resulted in the loss of five lives, including a police officer, and left a lasting impact on the nation. As the country continues to navigate the aftermath, a crucial question remains unanswered: Was there a more extensive, deeper conspiracy at play?\n\nA newly formed commission comprising lawmakers from both political parties, historians, and experts is working to uncover the truth. The commission's mandate is to investigate the circumstances surrounding the attack and explore the \"facts and causes\" related to the breach of the Capitol.\n\nThe inquiry will also examine any broader and longer-term factors that may have contributed to the violence, including potential coordination by political, ideological, or other organizations, as well as the government's actions before and after the attack.\n\nHowever, the commission's future is uncertain due to the Republican party's reaction to the proposal. While some Republicans supported the bill, many others, including key leaders, vehemently opposed it, labeling it a \"political exercise\" and a \"political attack\" on former President Trump.\n\nEven some who voted for the measure expressed reservations, citing concerns about the commission's intentions and potential findings. The Republican leadership's opposition is largely driven by their desire to defend Trump's record and maintain his support base.\n\nThe commission's focus on law enforcement and intelligence failures may also be a source of concern for Republicans, as it could potentially harm Trump and his supporters. If the GOP continues to resist the commission and fails to appoint its Republican members, the project may collapse, leaving the country without answers to the critical questions surrounding the attack.\n\nIt is essential for the country to uncover the truth about what happened on January 6, who was responsible, and how to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future. The January 6 Commission is the best way to achieve this goal, and it is hoped that Republicans in Congress will recognize the importance of the commission's work and allow it to proceed.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The realm of digital discourse is abuzz with the musings of visionary entrepreneur Elon Musk, who has taken to Twitter to expound upon topics such as sustainable energy, electric transportation, and celestial exploration. However, the enigmatic mogul has faced a torrent of criticism from the public on the platform, prompting some to question his presence there.\n\nFor those contemplating a departure from Twitter, consider exploring alternative digital domains like Mastodon and Steemit. Both are open-source social networks that prioritize user privacy and offer a refreshing respite from the algorithm-driven dynamics of Twitter.\n\nMastodon, launched in 2017 by German programmer Eugen Rochko, is a decentralized, open-source Twitter competitor built on a similar architecture. Users' posts appear in their home timeline, with replies and mentions forming threads. The platform also features \"communities,\" public and private groups where users can engage with others.\n\nA key distinction between Mastodon and Twitter lies in the decentralized architecture, which allows users' posts to be more widely disseminated and visible. This means that your post can be seen by users worldwide, not limited to those following you.\n\nSteemit, a blockchain-based social network, rewards users for creating and curating content. Like Mastodon, it operates on a decentralized platform, rewarding users with \"Steem\" for posting and curating content.\n\nSteemit has been around since 2016, but its recent introduction of STEEM Power, a loyalty program that rewards users with additional tokens and rewards for posting and curating content, has garnered increased attention.\n\nUnlike Twitter, which relies heavily on algorithms to determine content visibility, Steemit is powered by a democratic, blockchain-based system. Content is only visible to users who vote for it, ensuring that users can only access content that has earned the most votes.\n\nHowever, unlike Mastodon, Steemit still has a long way to go before it can become a fully-fledged competitor to Twitter. The platform is still in its infancy, with many features lacking in comparison to Twitter, such as real-time conversations and hashtags.\n\nFor those seeking to break free from Twitter's grasp, Mastodon and Steemit offer an intriguing alternative. While both platforms still have a long way to go before they can rival the world's largest social network, they provide a more private and secure digital space that could be a viable option for those looking to leave Twitter behind.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Bulls are excited about getting the midterm elections behind us. Since 1950, all 18 midterm elections have been followed by an up year for stocks, according to LPL Financial. LPL also noted nearly identical returns after wins by both Democrats and Republicans, but not all gridlock gets treated equally. Chris Harvey from Wells Fargo noted this morning in a note to clients that, since 1948, the best combination for returns is a Democratic President, and a Republican House and Senate. That has occurred on four occasions since 1948 and has produced a 41% two-year return in the S & P 500. \"We believe this remains the most likely outcome for Election Day 2022,\" Harvey said. The reason the markets favor gridlock seems clear, LPL Financial said: 1) Lower risk of tax increases, 2) More centrist appointments to key posts, and 3) greater difficulty raising the debt ceiling. Regardless, bulls expecting an end of the year lift from the election tailwinds and other seasonal factors should not get too enthusiastic: strategist after strategist has warned that the macro environment is the dominant factor in setting stock prices, meaning the Fed and its battle against inflation, recession risks, and geopolitics will trump any seasonal factors.

{"text": "Paul Constant is a writer at Civic Ventures and the cohost of the \"Pitchfork Economics\" podcast.\n\nHe said inflation is measured using a \"market basket\" of goods and services.\n\nThe CPI can't fully explain inflation's rise \u2014 some price increases go to corporate profits, he says.\n\nTop editors give you the stories you want \u2014 delivered right to your inbox each weekday.

Drew Desilver at Pew Research Center wrote a great deep dive explaining this process last month.\n\nOur own experience as consumers informs us that prices on various goods and services are rising, and the inflation rate, derived from the CPI, confirms that our experience is true. But what the CPI can't explain \u2014 at least, not fully \u2014 is how and why inflation is rising.\n\nThe first thing to note is that inflation isn't just a problem in the United States\n\nVirtually every nation in the world is struggling with skyrocketing inflation rates, though the rate is increasing higher in the US than in most nations. The United Kingdom, for example, reported a 5.4% inflation rate in December.\n\nThe reason for this universal price hike is relatively simple: The pandemic shut down the global supply chain, which then caused a worldwide traffic jam for goods ranging from auto parts to semiconductors at the exact same time that demand for goods like electronics and home-improvement items increased for hundreds of millions of locked-down consumers around the world.\n\nChad Stone at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive think tank, among others, believes that inflation is largely the result of global consumer demand switching almost overnight from services to goods during the pandemic.\n\nThe second thing is that even if supply-chain problems were completely smoothed out over the next few months, inflation is still likely to be a big problem in the US for at least the next year\n\nThat's because rents and shelter costs, which make up a third of the CPI's \"market basket,\" are soaring right now.\n\nAs Zach Silk writes in the most recent issue of The Pitch, the sister newsletter to the \"Pitchfork Economics\" podcast, \"The average rent in the United States is nearly $1,900 a month, an increase of nearly $300 over this time last year \u2014 and that's the average, remember, while some cities like Miami have seen a 40% year-over-year increase of rents.\"\n\nEconomists warn that due to a variety of complex CPI aggregation issues, even if every price in America magically stopped rising tomorrow, rising rents alone would continue to drive up the overall inflation rate for the next year or so.\n\nThe last point to keep in mind with inflation is that, like everything else to do with the economy, those rising prices aren't established by some objective, all-seeing, all-knowing \"free market\" that assesses every aspect of the economy and sets prices accordingly.\n\nIn fact, a good number of the rising prices we're paying weren't strictly necessary at all\n\nDuring the last quarter of 2021, for example, Starbucks reported an eye-popping 31% increase in profits, and revenue increased for the quarter by almost 20% to just over $8 billion. On the same call that Starbucks announced those terrific numbers, the corporation also announced that it would raise its prices over the next year \u2014 probably more than once.\n\nThe company blamed \"supply-chain disruptions\" and higher costs for labor for the price hikes, but Jake Johnson at media nonprofit Common Dreams said that they didn't mention one raise in particular: Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson's pay increased by almost 40% last year to more than $20 million.\n\nIt's not just Starbucks: Many American corporations see inflationary panic as an opportunity to boost their profits. The Wall Street Journal reported that Todd Kahn, the CEO of luxury fashion brand Coach, even admitted that his company's \"rise in [prices] isn't really about inflation \u2026 it's about reducing discounting.\"\n\nJournalist Matt Stoller estimated that 60% of the price increases that ordinary Americans are paying are going directly to corporate profits, not to compensate for global supply issues or compensate for higher-priced goods.\n\nOf course, none of this context about inflation helps the ordinary American consumer, who's paying more for everyday items\n\nAll those wage increases that have happened since the labor market turned in favor of workers last year weren't enough to keep up with inflation, which took a 2.4% bite out of the average American paycheck.\n\nThese inflationary stresses are a complicated global problem, and it's going to take a suite of policies \u2014 from using government muscle to help smooth out lingering supply-chain snags to combating shameless corporate price gouging and exploitative rent hikes \u2014 to push inflation back down to healthy levels.\n\nBut you shouldn't buy finger-pointing that tries to pin inflation solely on lockdowns, stimulus checks, or other policies that were passed to help keep Americans safe and supported through the worst of pandemic.\n\nThat's the worst kind of trickle-down fear-mongering \u2014 meant to keep workers angry with workers and everyone's eyes off the real profiteers.", "label": "human"}

(MRNA), a biotechnology company that reported impressive quarterly earnings, surpassing analysts' predictions by a substantial margin. The company's revenue also exceeded expectations, reaching a significant milestone.\n\nThe positive news propelled Moderna's stock upward by over 10%, resulting in a remarkable 150% increase since the start of the year. Analysts had anticipated a decline due to rising expenses, but the company successfully defied expectations. The strong results were largely attributed to the successful sale of its mRNA-1273 vaccine, which has received emergency approval in the United States and is being administered globally.\n\nTwo other stocks that demonstrated robust growth this week were D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI) and NVR Inc. (NVR), both homebuilders that released impressive quarterly earnings reports. D.R. Horton's net income increased by nearly 20% year-over-year, while NVR's net income rose by 13%.\n\nIn response to the news, both companies' stocks experienced significant gains, with D.R. Horton's stock rising by over 10% and NVR's by over 7%. Since the start of the year, both companies have seen their stock prices surge, with D.R. Horton's up over 95% and NVR's up over 90%.\n\nThe strong performance of these homebuilders can be attributed to the ongoing housing boom in the United States. Housing starts rose by 3.2% in October, and home sales are expected to remain robust throughout the winter months, fueled in part by low interest rates.\n\nOther notable performers this week included Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which posted better-than-expected earnings and saw its stock rise by over 8%.

{"text": "A former executive of a now-inoperative digital asset trading platform expressed deep regret for misappropriating millions of dollars from customers.\n\n\"I was aware that my actions were incorrect,\" the individual, 31, told a judge during a sentencing hearing in the Eastern District of New York.\n\nThe executive, who co-founded the platform with their spouse in 2017, pleaded guilty in April to charges related to wire fraud and operating an unlicensed financial service. Prosecutors alleged that the executive orchestrated a scheme to defraud customers of at least $3 million.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Attorney's Office, between 2017 and 2020, the executive and others exploited their access to customer accounts to manipulate prices and artificially inflate the value of digital asset-based contracts. The executive then allegedly used the proceeds to purchase luxury items, including real estate, and fund personal bank accounts and digital wallets.\n\n\"This was not a typical criminal case,\" the judge remarked. \"It involved the use of technology to perpetrate the fraud. It was a serious crime and a bold crime.\"\n\nAs part of the plea agreement, the executive will repay all stolen funds and cooperate with the investigation. They also agreed to a three-year period of supervised release and a $5,000 fine.\n\nThe executive acknowledged their wrongdoing and asked for leniency, stating, \"I have taken full responsibility for my actions. I am truly sorry for what I have done.\"\n\nThe judge accepted the plea and sentenced the executive to two years in prison, followed by three years of supervised release.\n\n\"The court must take seriously the crime committed and impose a sentence that sends a message that those who engage in this type of behavior will be held accountable,\" the judge said.\n\nThe sentence serves as a warning to those who engage in fraudulent activities in the digital asset space. It is clear that the U.S. government is cracking down on anyone who attempts to defraud investors, customers, and the public.\n\n\"The sentence handed down to the executive should serve as a cautionary tale to those tempted to engage in digital asset fraud,\" said a U.S. Attorney. \"We remain committed to prosecuting those who seek to take advantage of our markets for their own personal gain.\"\n\nThe case is part of an ongoing effort by the U.S. government to crack down on digital asset fraud. In recent months, several other individuals have been charged with similar crimes, and the U.S. Department of Justice is actively investigating a number of other potential digital asset fraud cases.\n\nDigital asset fraud is a significant issue in the industry, and the U.S. government is taking it very seriously. Those who engage in these types of activities should know that they will face serious repercussions, as the executive's sentence demonstrates.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "A novel narrative unfolded on Tuesday as the gold market succumbed to a 1.2% decline, reaching its lowest point since late November. This downward trajectory was precipitated by a potent cocktail of factors, including the dollar's resurgence and the anticipation of a prolonged period of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe U.S. economic data released on Tuesday painted a robust picture, with housing starts surging 2.8% above expectations and permits rising 1.3%. This news sent the U.S. dollar index soaring 0.4%, its third consecutive day of gains. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield also reached a 1.63% high, its highest mark since March 2020, further eroding gold's appeal.\n\nDespite concerns over the new coronavirus variant and rising infections in the U.S., the dollar's strength offset these worries, leading to a decline in gold prices. According to Bart Melek, Head of Commodity Strategies at TD Securities, the recent string of positive U.S. economic data has been \"a little too strong\" for the market's liking, resulting in gold's downward trajectory.\n\nThe U.S. economy's robust recovery is expected to continue in 2021, driven by the rollout of vaccines and fiscal stimulus. The Fed has pledged to maintain rates at or near current levels through 2022, but traders are now speculating that a rate hike could occur sooner than expected. Gold investors are also keeping a close eye on the progress of the U.S. stimulus package, with negotiations ongoing between the White House and Democrats.\n\nWhile gold is typically seen as a safe-haven asset, its appeal may wane as the U.S. economy continues to recover and interest rates rise. Melek notes that gold could receive a boost when the stimulus package is finally passed, but in the short term, the strong data and potential rate hike being priced in by the markets will likely keep gold under pressure.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nEmail addresses linked to more than 200 million Twitter profiles are currently circulating on underground hacker forums, security experts say. The apparent data leak could expose the real-life identities of anonymous Twitter users and make it easier for criminals to hijack Twitter accounts, the experts warned, or even victims\u2019 accounts on other websites.\n\nThe trove of leaked records also includes Twitter users\u2019 names, account handles, follower numbers and the dates the accounts were created, according to forum listings reviewed by security researchers and shared with CNN.\n\n\u201cBad actors have won the jackpot,\u201d said Rafi Mendelsohn, a spokesman for Cyabra, a social media analysis firm focused on identifying disinformation and inauthentic online behavior. \u201cPreviously private data such as emails, handles, and creation date can be leveraged to build smarter and more sophisticated hacking, phishing and disinformation campaigns.\u201d\n\nSome reports suggested the data was collected in 2021 through a bug in Twitter\u2019s systems, a flaw the company fixed in 2022 after a separate incident in July involving 5.4 million Twitter accounts alerted the company to the vulnerability.\n\nTroy Hunt, a security researcher, said Thursday that his analysis of the data \u201cfound 211,524,284 unique email addresses\u201d that had been leaked. The Washington Post earlier reported a forum listing promoting the data of 235 million accounts.\n\nHunt did not immediately respond to a question from CNN asking whether the records would be added to his website, haveibeenpwned.com, which allows users to search hacked records to determine if they have been affected. CNN has not independently verified the records\u2019 authenticity.\n\nTwitter didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Its communication team, along with roughly half of Twitter\u2019s overall workforce, was gutted after billionaire Elon Musk completed his acquisition the company in late October. The significant staff reductions could now add to concerns about the company\u2019s ability to respond to security threats.\n\nThe breadth of the leaked data could allow malicious actors or repressive governments to connect anonymous Twitter handles with the real names or email addresses of their owners, potentially unmasking dissidents, journalists, activists or other at-risk users around the world, security researchers warn.\n\n\u201cFor those people, this is a very consequential breach,\u201d said John Scott-Railton, a security researcher at The University of Toronto\u2019s Citizen Lab.\n\nThe account data could also be valuable to hackers who can use the information as part of password-reset attempts and account takeovers. The risk is particularly high for individuals who use the same account credentials on Twitter as they do for other digital services such as banks or cloud storage, researchers said, because hackers could take information gleaned from the leak to pry open user accounts elsewhere.\n\nVerified Twitter users caught up in the apparent leak, or users with particularly large followings, will be particularly valuable targets as a result of the leak, security experts warned, as those account holders may be especially influential celebrities or susceptible to extortion.\n\nTo protect themselves from phishing attempts, internet users should use unique passwords for each online service and keep track of them using a digital password manager, security researchers say. They should also enable multi-factor authentication for each of their accounts, and exercise caution when opening unsolicited email or links.\n\nAccording to the cybersecurity news outlet BleepingComputer, which did claim to test the data, the latest dump appears similar to a leaked dataset advertised on hacking forums in November containing an alleged 400 million records, but slimmed down to eliminate some duplicate records. Twitter has not commented on that leak.\n\nReports of the leak could expand Twitter\u2019s already significant legal and regulatory risk.\n\nIn December, Twitter\u2019s main European privacy regulator, the Irish Data Protection Commission, said it is investigating the July 2022 leak as a possible violation of Europe\u2019s signature privacy law, known as GDPR.\n\nLast summer, the company\u2019s former head of security, Peiter \u201cMudge\u201d Zatko, filed a whistleblower report to the US government alleging long-ignored security vulnerabilities in Twitter\u2019s operations. Zatko claimed that Twitter\u2019s shortcomings on security reflected a breach of Twitter\u2019s binding commitments to the Federal Trade Commission, a serious offense. (Twitter broadly and repeatedly pushed back at Zatko\u2019s allegations.)\n\nSuccessive incidents at Twitter have led to the company signing two consent orders with the FTC since 2011 to improve its cybersecurity posture. Violations of FTC orders can lead to fines, business restrictions and even sanctions targeting individual executives.\n\nIn November, top Twitter officials responsible for privacy and security resigned from the company, just days after Musk closed his purchase of the platform and amid the mass layoffs that in some cases cut whole departments.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "LONDON, Dec 22 (Reuters) - China's imports of primary aluminium jumped to a one-year high of 110,700 tonnes in November in a significant reversal of the recent trend.\n\nThe country flipped to net exporter in the first half of 2022, with primary metal shipped as far as Europe and the United States to capitalise on sky-high physical premiums.\n\nThe premiums are now much reduced. That for duty-unpaid in Europe collapsed from over $600 per tonne in May to a current $250 over the London Metal Exchange (LME) cash price.\n\nWhile European smelter output declines under the weight of high energy prices, the region is also bracing for a recessionary hit to demand.\n\nChina appears to be taking up some of the slack as its own production momentum stalls just as the country tries to open up from quarantine and lockdown.\n\nChina's imports and exports of primary unwrought aluminium\n\nTRADE FLOWS FLIP AGAIN\n\nChina's primary aluminium export surge has passed. Outbound shipments totalled 190,000 tonnes in the first eight months of the year, the highest volume of exports since 2010.\n\nExports have since shrunk to 5,000 tonnes over the September-November period with high-volume shipments to Europe and the United States replaced by a trickle of material to African destinations.\n\nUntil last month, imports had been subdued relative to the previous couple of years and largely comprised Russian metal shunned by Western buyers after Russia's \"special military operation\" in Ukraine began in February.\n\nRussian imports hit a fresh 2022 high of 56,000 tonnes in November but its share of imports dropped to 51% from 85% in June. The balance was sourced from a range of countries, suggesting more Chinese pull than Russian push.\n\nIt's worth noting that China's imports of unwrought aluminium alloy have remained consistently strong at around 100,000 tonnes per month since a structural shift higher in 2019.\n\nThe step change coincided with a slump in imports of aluminium scrap ahead of a planned ban in 2020. The ban was pulled at the last moment and replaced with tighter purity thresholds.\n\nScrap imports have since rebounded, up 60% so far this year, but without any impact on alloy flows.\n\nGlobal aluminium production monthly change annualised\n\nSLOWING MOMENTUM\n\nChina's renewed import appetite for primary aluminium looks at odds with the combination of lockdown-weakened demand and strong domestic production growth.\n\nHeadline national output was up by 7.2% year-on-year in November with cumulative production up 3.1% in the first 11 months of 2022, the latest estimates by the International Aluminium Institute (IAI) showed.\n\nHowever, the year-on-year comparison is accentuated by a low base in the closing months of 2021, when multiple producers were forced to reduce run-rates during a rolling energy crunch.\n\nExpressed in terms of annualised production, China's collective run-rate has dropped by almost 1.2 million tonnes since August. That's not as much as the 2.0-million tonne decline in late 2021 but still a significant dissipation of the early-year production surge.\n\nEnergy is again the culprit.\n\nAlthough there are no national blanket power restrictions over the winter heating season this year, provinces have delegated powers to manage their local power balances and the smelter hits have been mounting up.\n\nSichuan briefly rationed power to industrial users, including aluminium smelters, in August because of a protracted drought in the hydro-rich province.\n\nThe following month Yunnan ordered its smelters to reduce operating rates by 10% for the same reason, lifting the mandate to 20% in October.\n\nLast month saw several smelters in Henan province reduce output by 10% on a combination of weak market conditions and pressure from local winter heating restrictions, according to consultancy AZ Global.\n\nThe seasonal power pressures have spread to the province of Guizhou this month with local smelters taking cuts of up to 31% of capacity, AZ Global reports.\n\nGuizhou is a relatively small aluminium province with annual production of around one million tonnes but Yunnan is a growing hub of production on the basis of its green energy credentials.\n\nHongqiao, China's largest private operator, is undeterred by this year's power constraints and is moving more of its capacity there.\n\nHowever, the concentration of smelters in Yunnan and Sichuan leaves China's domestic supply chain facing a new source of instability in the form of seasonal rainfall levels.\n\nSHIFT TO SURPLUS\n\nThe scale of the cumulative production hit in China has been masked by impact of rolling lockdowns and a foundering property sector on domestic demand.\n\nThe partial lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, although fraught with the danger of a wave of Omicron infections, is expected to revitalise Chinese growth over 2023.\n\nAny recovery impetus will require an aluminium restock. Visible inventory on the Shanghai Futures Exchange has slumped by 71% since the start of January and at a current 92,373 tonnes is around the lowest levels since 2016.\n\nIt is too early to say if last month's jump in imports is an early sign of domestic recovery in the aluminium sector but it signals a shift in market flows.\n\nThe Western deficits earlier this year attracted significant volumes of metal from Asia, including China. The supply-chain tension has accordingly eased and the market focus has shifted to weakening demand and the potential for large amounts of aluminium to head to LME warehouses.\n\nThe east-west pendulum is swinging back again and it's China that looks de-stocked and in need of some top-up metal from the spot market.\n\nHow much will depend on how China's many provincial authorities balance their power systems over the next few winter months.\n\nThe opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.\n\nEditing by Barbara Lewis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n\nOpinions expressed are those of the author.

Today, only two belong to Wells Fargo and JPMorgan \u2014 and both are held by landlords, not homeowners who use the properties as their primary residences.\n\nBloomberg's reporting on Walbrook Avenue reinforces how the economic disaster brought on by the subprime-mortgage crash that stretched from 2007 to 2010 disproportionately hurt minority households \u2014 and how the effects are being felt to this day.\n\nBlack Americans have historically owned their own homes at much lower rates than white Americans, and the disappearance of these large lenders from Walbrook Avenue and elsewhere have contributed to what is known as the homeownership gap. As of October 2021, according to the US Census Bureau, 45% of Black Americans owned homes, which is nearly 30 points below the rate of white Americans: 74.6%.\n\nOn Walbrook Avenue, the absence of large lenders has left many locals without a lifeline. Several residents like Terrence Jones Jr. \u2014 who was just a teenager when he and his family were forced out of their home in 2013 \u2014 have lost their homes to foreclosure only to see their mortgages sold to investors who flipped their properties for a tidy profit.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg's investigation, Wells Fargo, which purchased the mortgage on the Joneses' family home from an undisclosed lender in 2012, sold at least 3,000 of its Baltimore properties to real-estate attorneys from that year to 2021. While it's unclear how many homeowners have lost their properties as a result, Bloomberg suggested that the bank's actions had contributed to lower rates of Black homeownership in the area.\n\nRudy Miales, a retired resident of Walbrook Avenue who paid off his mortgage in 1980, told Bloomberg he'd seen many of his neighbors leave the area, replaced by renters who often do not have ties to the community.\n\n\"All these people over here, they might not be here tomorrow,\" Miales told Bloomberg, pointing to several rental units near his home.\n\nThe racial wealth gap grows as Black Americans lose access to capital\n\nBecause homeownership is a key driver of wealth, the banks' pullback from Walbrook Avenue ends up limiting the prospects of financial gain for many locals who remain. It's a problem affecting many predominantly Black communities throughout the US.\n\nAmerica's biggest banks and lenders recognized the problem was dire. After the 2008-2009 financial crisis, several financial institutions made pledges to invest billions of dollars to support Black homeownership.\n\nBut in the years since, many of their actions have fallen short of their promises due to a mixture of lending discrimination and the banks' tendency to avoid Federal Housing Administration-backed home loans \u2014 a particularly popular mortgage program for first-time buyers that offers low-down-payment options.\n\nWells Fargo made the largest vow in 2017: a pledge to lend $60 billion for the creation of 250,000 Black homeowners within a decade. But, according to Bloomberg, it underwrote 42% fewer mortgages to Black buyers in 2021 than in the year it announced its goal.\n\n\"That's clearly going in the wrong direction,\" Brad Blackwell, a retired senior executive behind Wells Fargo's 2017 goal, told Bloomberg.\n\nA 2021 study from Brookings Institution, a nonprofit public-policy organization, shows that since 2010, the number of banks in majority-black neighborhoods has decreased by 14.6%. Their withdrawal has helped to widen the nation's racial wealth gap.\n\n\"Achieving the American dream \u2014 the opportunity to succeed, to provide food and shelter for family members, education for children, hope for a better life, and freedom of opportunity \u2014 requires capital,\" the Brookings researchers Kristen Broady, Mac McComas, and Amine Ouazad wrote in the study. \"But, in the United States, access to capital for individuals and business owners is uneven based on race. The racial wealth gap remains significant.\"\n\nIndeed, government estimates indicate that in the third quarter of this year white Americans held 82% of total US wealth while making up roughly 60% of the population, whereas Black Americans made up 13% of the population but held only about 5% of the wealth.\n\nCorrection: December 29, 2022 \u2014 An earlier version of this story misstated the most recent estimate for the share of US wealth held by Black Americans.

With the nearest land hundreds of miles away, Wilson and her family were compelled to rely on rationed provisions and prayers for rescue.\n\nWilson candidly admitted, \"I genuinely thought I would succumb to the elements on that boat. I was petrified and exhausted, yet I refused to relinquish hope. We had to persevere.\"\n\nThe family began their journey with sufficient sustenance, hydration, and fuel to sustain them for a few days. However, the wind and currents worked against them, leaving them at the mercy of the sea with no engine to propel them forward. All they could do was wait and implore for assistance.\n\nThey meticulously rationed their supplies, managing to stay afloat for nearly a month before being rescued by a passing sailboat crewed by an experienced sailor who had also navigated a similar ordeal.\n\nAs the family drew closer to safety, they dispatched a distress signal, hoping to attract the attention of someone with a boat and medical supplies.\n\nThe family was eventually rescued by the passing sailboat crew, who had also experienced a similar journey.\n\nWilson expressed her gratitude, saying, \"I am thankful every day for the individuals who assisted us and for the remarkable stories of human resilience that were shared along the way.\"\n\nThe experience has profoundly altered Wilson's perspective, imbuing her with newfound confidence in herself and her family's strength.\n\n\"I previously believed I couldn't overcome adversity, but now I believe in myself and my family's resilience,\" she said.\n\nWilson's story serves as a poignant reminder of humanity's capacity to overcome formidable obstacles and thrive in the most extreme environments on Earth.\n\nFor Wilson, the experience also underscored the significance of community.\n\n\"We are not designed to navigate life alone,\" Wilson said. \"We are meant to rely on one another, particularly in times of need.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of their extraordinary journey, the Wilson family is looking forward to the future, with plans to establish a foundation to aid other families facing similar challenges.\n\n\"This experience has taught me so much and inspired me to pay it forward,\" Wilson said. \"We have been given a second chance, and we want to help others who are in need.\"\n\nWith courage, faith, and an abundance of support, the Wilson family defied the odds and survived an unprecedented voyage.

{"text": "In the wake of this week's unprecedented wave of U.S. flight cancellations, experts and passengers alike are weighing in on how flyers can better prepare for a disrupted itinerary.\n\nWhile multiple explanations have been put forward to explain the chaos that stranded thousands of passengers in the last few days \u2014 the majority of which was led by Southwest Airlines and included weather, staffing and technology issues \u2014 there should be one key takeaway, experts say: Flyers can no longer rely on their airline when something goes awry, and instead should have the savvy and, where possible, the financial resources to take matters into their own hands.\n\n\"The days are gone when you could just take off without a backup plan,\" said Kathleen Bangs, a former commercial airline pilot and spokeswoman for FlightAware, a company that provides flight-tracking services.\n\nFirst, all travelers should download their airline's digital app, or get familiar with sites like Google Flights, in the event they must look for an alternative flight, she said. Some airlines, including Southwest, no longer have automatic agreements in place that allow for rebooking on another airline free of charge, she said.\n\nAnd because of consolidation within the industry, there are fewer planes flying overall, leaving many passengers with generally fewer options, said Scott Mayerowitz, the executive editor of The Points Guy travel site. All the more important, then, to know how to quickly look up alternatives in a pinch.\n\nThe image of seemingly endless lines of passengers waiting to speak with a rebooking agent should also cement the idea that air passengers must be the masters of their own fate, and can do so through a mobile device.\n\nRebooking online saved passenger Ryan Mitchell. He and his family spent Christmas in Austin, Texas, and intended to fly home to Raleigh, North Carolina, on Dec. 26 via Southwest. When their flight was canceled, he decided to drive to the airport to rebook after not being able to reach a Southwest representative by phone \u2014 not realizing a nationwide fiasco was unfolding.\n\nBy the time he got to the airport around noon, he said in an email, \"there was a line a thousand people long.\"\n\nImmediately, Mitchell said, he started looking on his phone for other options besides Southwest. He was able to find one on another airline for $350 leaving the same day.\n\n\"Bought it as fast as I could,\" he said. \"Checked prices a few hours later ... anything leaving Monday or Tuesday was in the thousands of dollars.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Southwest said customers affected by flight cancellations or significant flight delays from last Saturday and next Tuesday can submit receipts for consideration via email or on Southwest.com. It also posted a link to a refund request form.\n\nSouthwest executives said Thursday that anyone whose flight was cancelled is entitled to a full refund and that the airline would reimburse travel expenses, including tickets on other carriers, rental cars, gas, hotels and meals. Southwest will look at extenuating circumstances case by case. And it will pay for baggage to be shipped to the customer by FedEx or UPS or, in some cases, on a Southwest aircraft.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, the Transportation Department said it would use the fullest extent of its investigative and enforcement powers to hold Southwest accountable if the airline fails to adhere to the promises it made to compensate passengers.\n\nBut the Southwest executives said the reimbursement process could take several weeks.\n\nSo, experts say, flyers should also seriously consider budgeting additional financial resources in the event they must book a night at a hotel or rent a car.\n\nStranded Southwest Airlines passengers looks for their luggage at Chicago Midway International Airport on Wednesday. Kamil Krzacynski / AFP via Getty Images\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do if the airline can\u2019t save you?\u201d Bangs said. \u201cYou have to have the financial resources to get a backup ticket on another airline.\u201d\n\nIf possible, Mayerowitz also recommends keeping \"a diverse stash\" of points and frequent flyer miles across airlines and hotel vendors. Certain credit cards allow users to easily build them up.\n\n\"If you have a last-minute funeral, miles can help,\" he said. \"If hotel rooms are outrageously overpriced, points can help you. So everyone should have an emergency fund, but it should be in points and miles.\"\n\nBangs said situational awareness is also important. Keeping an eye on weather forecasts that may affect your travel plans, and also what alternative destinations may be within reasonable driving distance.\n\nShe bemoaned what she called the \"learned helplessness\" many flyers now experience when they arrive at an airport.\n\n\"It can feel like you're trapped in a netherworld, but you\u2019re not,\" Bangs said. \"You need to be proactive on your own behalf.\"\n\nAt least one passenger said she is now rethinking holiday travel altogether. Sallyann Koontz got stuck in Austin after her Southwest Airlines flight home to Charleston, South Carolina, was canceled. She said she would have already rebooked on another airline but found ticket prices had become too expensive \u2014 despite price caps meant to ease the burden on travelers.\n\nNext year, she said in an email, she'll plan differently when it comes to Southwest.\n\n\"It has served the public with affordable flights and possibly allowed travel for less affluent families for decades,\" Koontz said of the airline. \"I would still use them but maybe I would completely avoid holiday travel or believe the horrific weather predictions and cancel my travel plans.\"", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Nick Crocker, 37, is living in a school bus he built out with his fianc\u00e9e in Portland, Oregon.\n\nIt's largely due to his $108,000 student-debt balance that he cannot afford to pay off.\n\nCrocker said his student debt is his \"biggest regret\" and wishes he had gone to trade school.\n\nTop editors give you the stories you want \u2014 delivered right to your inbox each weekday.

But his $108,100 student-debt balance is continuing to hold him back.\n\nWhen Crocker, now 37, started his education at the School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University, he did not anticipate the economic recession he was graduating into in 2008. He was unable to land a job using his bachelor's degree, and right out of college he moved to Pennsylvania and began working two jobs \u2014 one at Jimmy John's and one at Olive Garden.\n\nDuring that time, he was able to keep up with his $540 monthly student-debt payment. When it doubled to $1,089 a month once his graduation-repayment plan ended, the only option available to Crocker that would decrease his monthly payment was to extend the time it would take to pay the balance off. Crocker knew something had to give.\n\n\"I was tired of throwing away half of my income on rent and not being able to save a dime in the process,\" Crocker told Insider. \"So I decided to build out a school bus.\"\n\nThe inside of Nick Crocker's bus he built out for himself. Nick Crocker\n\nSince October 2018, Crocker and his fianc\u00e9e have been living in a 120-square-foot school bus he spent $25,000 to renovate. He pays around $550 a month to rent out a backyard parking space in Portland, Oregon. Even with those extra savings from rent payments, Crocker defaulted on some of his student loans because he was not making sufficient income to afford basic necessities alongside his student-loan bills. He's only continued to make payments on a loan that his father cosigned to ensure his dad wouldn't be impacted by a potential default.\n\nMeanwhile, President Joe Biden's student-loan forgiveness plans are facing challenges. After Biden announced up to $20,000 in debt relief at the end of August for federal borrowers, conservative lawsuits arose seeking to block the relief, and two federal courts have so far blocked it from being implemented.\n\nThe Education Department has appealed those decisions, but the relief remains on hold for the time being.\n\nWith the majority of Crocker's debt being private loans, Biden's relief won't make a significant dent for him and about 3 million other borrowers with private loans. He says he wishes he'd known the high, life-long costs of higher education when he was in high school. It may have prevented him from being in his current situation.\n\n\"While college was a great way for me to figure some things out, it was a really expensive way for me to do that,\" Crocker said. \"I wouldn't do that again. I would have gone into the trades. The student-loan debt is by far my biggest regret \u2014 it's too much money to let somebody borrow at 18 years old.\"\n\n'We're not getting out from underneath this'\n\nThe reason the majority of Crocker's student debt is held privately is because when he was applying for federal financial aid in high school, his parents' income was high enough that they only qualified for limited aid. Still, he needed funds because he was responsible for some of the expenses, and private student loans were readily available, so Crocker turned to those \u2014 but later found that the high interest rates on private loans make it difficult to touch the original balance borrowed.\n\n\"I wasn't chipping my way out of this,\" Crocker said. \"$540 a month was just covering interest, so at some point, we're not getting out from underneath this.\"\n\nBefore Crocker began falling behind on his monthly payments, he said he had a great credit score. After his loan company raised his monthly payment in 2015, his wages at his grocery-store job were garnished, so he picked up carpentry and other jobs on the side to keep up.\n\nNow, as an adventure-van builder making $25 an hour in Portland, he said he knows his current living situation is not sustainable in the long run. He will eventually need to face high rent prices and his six-figure student-debt load.\n\nAs Insider previously reported, average rent in the US has increased to $1,722 a month, which is more than 30% of the national median income, accounting for taxes. While mortgage debt is the largest form of consumer debt in the US, student debt follows right behind, currently totaling $1.7 trillion for over 40 million Americans. But while the Education Department oversees federal loans, private student loans can fly under the radar, which is why the department has taken actions to ensure private lenders don't steer students into unaffordable debt.\n\nThe Federal Student Aid office in March detailed requirements for colleges to better inform students about the risks of private student-loan options that can carry costly fees, writing in a blog post that \"the stakes could not be higher\" for students when they figure out how to pay for college.\n\nCrocker said he's \"on a savings plan right now\" by living in a bus, but wishes he'd gone to a trade school rather than take on student loans for a degree he couldn't use.\n\n\"I would love to be able to afford to buy a house, but right now it's not the best market to be buying a house,\" Crocker said. \"So we're living in a 120-square-foot school bus, and while it's been a great way for us to save the money, it's cramped. And we want more than that.\"", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Gregg Berhalter said Thursday that he would \"like to continue in my role\" as U.S. men's national team head coach.\n\nBerhalter's contract expired on Dec. 31. U.S. Soccer is currently reviewing his performance over the past four years, and specifically at the 2022 World Cup. The review has been complicated by an investigation into a decades-old domestic violence incident involving Berhalter and his now-wife, Rosalind. The incident was brought to U.S. Soccer officials by the parents of midfielder Gio Reyna amid friction between Berhalter and Gio.\n\nWith the investigation and the review both ongoing, U.S. Soccer tabbed Anthony Hudson, one of Berhalter's assistants, to take charge of the USMNT at a January training camp. But U.S. Soccer sporting director Earnie Stewart confirmed Wednesday that Berhalter remains \u201cunder consideration\u201d for the job going forward, pending the investigation.\n\nGregg Berhalter claps to fans after the USMNT's World Cup Round of 16 loss to the Netherlands. (AP Photo/Francisco Seco)\n\nBerhalter addressed and detailed the early-'90s domestic violence incident in a Tuesday statement. On Thursday, he gave his first media interview since the World Cup to the Harvard Business Review, via LinkedIn. When asked about the Reyna saga, he said his \"entire family is saddened by these events.\"\n\n\"The worst part of it for me is, my heart aches for my wife,\" he said. \"Because it was her story to tell, if she chose to or not.\"\n\nInstead, when Danielle and Claudio Reyna, Gio's parents, brought the decades-old incident to Stewart on Dec. 11, Stewart was obligated to report it. U.S. Soccer hired a law firm to investigate it. That prompted Berhalter to publicly disclose it for the first time.\n\n\"I feel tremendously bad that my profession had to bring this to the public light,\" Berhalter said Thursday.\n\nIn the Tuesday statement, which was signed by both Gregg and Rosalind, Gregg wrote that, a few months into their relationship, while in college at the University of North Carolina, they were \u201cout drinking at a local bar\u201d when they \u201chad a heated argument that continued outside. It became physical and I kicked her in the legs.\" (Danielle Reyna said Wednesday that Gregg's description \"significantly minimize[d] the abuse on the night in question.\")\n\nStory continues\n\nGregg and Rosalind later reconciled, got married in the late '90s, and have four kids. Berhalter said Thursday that their relationship remains \"a loving relationship, a devoted relationship.\" After feeling the need to unearth the decades-old trauma, he said the family is \"taking it one day at a time, and moving forward.\"\n\nHe had agreed to Thursday's Harvard Business Review interview long before the saga burst into public view on Tuesday and Wednesday. \"We committed to doing this before all this stuff happened, and I wasn't gonna back down from it, because I said I would do it,\" Berhalter said, and then he answered questions for 30 minutes.\n\nWhen asked whether he'd like to continue as USMNT head coach over the next four years, he said:\n\n\"It's a fantastic group of players. A super high potential in this group. And we're competing in the World Cup in North America in 2026. So it would be an amazing challenge for this team.\n\n\"When we started in 2018, we wanted to change the way the world views American soccer. And I think when you ask around the world now about our team, the world sees us in a completely different light. But now it's about being able to take that next step. And that next step is doing something that no U.S. team has ever done, and that's get to the semifinals and see what happens from there.\n\n\"So there's a lot of great challenges involved. And of course I'd like to continue in my role.\"\n\nHe also addressed his early December comments that led Danielle Reyna to speak to Stewart. At a HOW Institute leadership conference that Berhalter thought was \"off the record,\" he spoke about how he almost sent an unnamed USMNT player home from the World Cup in Qatar. His comments were erroneously published by the Charter newsletter. Media reports soon revealed that the player whom Berhalter had described was Gio Reyna.\n\nWhen asked Thursday whether he had any regrets, Berhalter said, in part: \"If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't have told that story [about the unnamed player at the HOW event]. It brought too much unwarranted attention to an overall shining example of team culture and teamwork. So that would be something that I would go back and change, for sure.\"\n\nHis interviewer, Adi Ignatius, said multiple times that the roughly 200 people in the room at the HOW conference \"all walked away not even thinking about individual players or anything like that. ... I listened to you talk, you didn't throw any of your players under the bus.\"\n\nIgnatius also opened the interview by describing the subsequent saga as: \"Berhalter's decision to limit the playing time of one of his young players prompted the player's parents to try to blackmail him by threatening to expose an incident more than three decades ago where Berhalter and a woman got into a fight. This is the ultimate soccer mom nightmare.\"\n\nBerhalter never disputed nor corrected that characterization of the events.\n\nWhen asked, \"given what has happened with the Reynas,\" how he would go about rebuilding trust, Berhalter said:\n\n\"Trust is something that takes a long time to build, but can go away really quickly. What I would say is, you have to be consistent with who you are, and you have to have clear values. And if you are, people can see that, and they can trust that consistency.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "For a year, I've been embarking on a journey around the world, working in a variety of communal living spaces, mostly located in the European region. This occupation is unconventional, yet I've relished every moment of it. I've encountered some extraordinary individuals and had some unforgettable experiences, but it's also been a demanding job. Each day, I'm up early, tackling tasks such as cleaning, event planning, and hosting social gatherings in exchange for a free place to stay.\n\nWorking in a communal living space is certainly not for everyone. You need to be comfortable with a significant amount of noise and chaos, and you must be able to manage difficult situations. You also need to be an effective communicator, as I spend most of my time interacting with residents, assisting them with navigating the city, or ensuring their safety during social events. However, despite the challenges, I wouldn't trade it for any other occupation in the world.\n\nWhen I first arrived at a communal living space, I was a bit apprehensive. The location was in a popular tourist destination, so I wasn't sure if I'd fit in. However, once I settled in and started interacting with the other staff members, I quickly felt at ease. Everyone was genuinely friendly and welcoming, which made the transition to my new role much smoother.\n\nThe daily tasks in a communal living space can vary, but one of my primary responsibilities is maintaining the cleanliness of the shared areas. I'm constantly performing tasks such as cleaning, doing laundry, and scrubbing bathrooms. It's a never-ending battle against dirt and grime, but I'm making progress! Once the shared areas are cleaned, I move on to planning activities and events. I'm often responsible for booking excursions, organizing social gatherings, and creating promotional materials. It's a significant amount of work, but I always feel a sense of accomplishment when I see our residents enjoying themselves.\n\nMost of the individuals who work in communal living spaces are between the ages of 18 and 30, so we tend to get along exceptionally well. We're all driven, passionate people who have chosen to do something different with our lives. We each have our own unique stories and experiences, which makes the workplace so engaging and dynamic. And, of course, we love having a good time! Working in a communal living space means that I'm always surrounded by people who are fun, adventurous, and who want to make the most of every day.\n\nThe most challenging aspect of working in a communal living space is trying to manage difficult residents. Because the space is designed to cater to a younger, more social crowd, there can be some demanding situations. We've had to deal with individuals who are intoxicated, unruly, or disrespectful. However, the majority of the time, our residents are wonderful people with whom we've had some great conversations.\n\nIn the end, my experience working in a communal living space has been overwhelmingly positive. I've met some amazing individuals, created some lasting memories, and had the privilege of staying in some incredible locations. And, I'm also earning some money for my travels and saving a significant amount on accommodation. I wouldn't trade my experience for anything, and I'm excited to continue exploring and growing through this incredible journey.", "label": "machine"}

Analyst Jason Goldberg downgraded shares of Ally to equal weight from overweight, saying the bank is more vulnerable to a downshift in the economy. \"This year is likely to witness the end of the Fed tightening cycle and loan loss normalization,\" Goldberg wrote in a Tuesday note. \"As such, we are becoming less constructive on those with outsized asset sensitivity and areas we believe loan losses will adjust the fastest \u2013 namely, lower-end consumer (most impacted by much reduced stimulus, elevated inflation, and higher interest rates) and commercial real estate (uncertainties in office, retail, health care segments),\" Goldberg added. Banks are starting the new year with several advantages and disadvantages. While they are generally well positioned to weather economic shocks, they're also dealing with an uncertain macro that could mean higher credit losses and slowing loan growth. Ally shares had their worst year on record in 2022, dropping 48.7%. The analyst lowered his price target to $33, down from $40, which implies nearly 35% upside from Friday's closing price. \"While ALLY should still be able to achieve a core ROTCE in the mid-double digits range over time, results in the near-term will likely be pressured due to the impacts of higher rates partially offset by continued loan growth,\" Goldberg wrote.

{"text": "Prices of fruit and vegetables are on display in a store in Brooklyn, New York City, March 29, 2022. Andrew Kelly | Reuters\n\nGlobal markets have taken heart in recent weeks from data indicating that inflation may have peaked, but economists warn against the return of the \"transitory\" inflation narrative. Stocks bounced when October's U.S. consumer price index came in below expectations earlier this month, as investors began to bet on an easing of the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes. While most economists expect a significant general decline in headline inflation rates in 2023, many are doubtful that this will herald a fundamental disinflationary trend. Paul Hollingsworth, chief European economist at BNP Paribas, warned investors on Monday to beware the return of \"Team Transitory,\" a reference to the school of thought that projected rising inflation rates at the start of the year would be fleeting. The Fed itself was a proponent of this view, and Chairman Jerome Powell eventually issued a mea culpa accepting that the central bank had misread the situation. \"Reviving the 'transitory' inflation narrative might seem tempting, but underlying inflation is likely to remain elevated by past standards,\" Hollingsworth said in a research note, adding that upside risks to the headline rate next year are still present, including a potential recovery in China.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"Big swings in inflation highlight one of the key features of the global regime shift that we believe is underway: greater volatility of inflation,\" he added. The French bank expects a \"historically large\" fall in headline inflation rates next year, with almost all regions seeing lower inflation than in 2022, reflecting a combination of base effects \u2014 the negative contribution to annual inflation rate occurring as month-on-month changes shrink \u2014 and dynamics between supply and demand shift. Hollingsworth noted that this could revive the \"transitory\" narrative\" next year, or at least a risk that investors \"extrapolate the inflationary trends that emerge next year as a sign that inflation is rapidly returning to the 'old' normal.\" These narratives could translate into official predictions from governments and central banks, he suggested, with the U.K.'s Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) projecting outright deflation in 2025-26 in \"striking contrast to the current market RPI fixings,\" and the Bank of England forecasting significantly below-target medium-term inflation.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe skepticism about a return to normal inflation levels was echoed by Deutsche Bank. Chief Investment Officer Christian Nolting told CNBC last week that the market's pricing for central bank cuts in the second half of 2023 were premature. \"Looking through our models, we think yes, there is a mild recession, but from an inflation point of view,\" we think there are second-round effects,\" Nolting said. He pointed to the seventies as a comparable period when the Western world was rocked by an energy crisis, suggesting that second-round effects of inflation arose and central banks \"cut too early.\" \"So from our perspective, we think inflation is going to be lower next year, but also higher than compared to previous years, so we will stay at higher levels, and from that perspective, I think central banks will stay put and not cut very fast,\" Nolting added. Reasons to be cautious Some significant price increases during the Covid-19 pandemic were widely considered not to actually be \"inflation,\" but a result of relative shifts reflecting specific supply and demand imbalances, and BNP Paribas believes the same is true in reverse. As such, disinflation or outright deflation in some areas of the economy should not be taken as indicators of a return to the old inflation regime, Hollingsworth urged. What's more, he suggested that companies may be slower to adjust prices downward than they were to increase them, given the effect of surging costs on margins over the past 18 months. Although goods inflation will likely slow, BNP Paribas sees services inflation as stickier in part due to underlying wage pressures. \"Labour markets are historically tight and \u2013 to the extent that there has likely been a structural element to this, particularly in the U.K. and U.S. (e.g. the increase in inactivity due to long-term sickness in the UK) \u2013 we expect wage growth to stay relatively elevated by past standards,\" Hollingsworth said.\n\nwatch now\n\nChina's Covid policy has recaptured headlines in recent days, and stocks in Hong Kong and the mainland bounced on Tuesday after Chinese health authorities reported a recent uptick in senior vaccination rates, which is regarded by experts as crucial to reopening the economy. BNP Paribas projects that a gradual relaxation of China's zero-Covid policy could be inflationary for the rest of the world, as China has been contributing little to global supply constraints in recent months and an easing of restrictions is \"unlikely to materially boost supply.\" \"By contrast, a stronger recovery in Chinese demand is likely to put upward pressure on global demand (for commodities in particular) and thus, all else equal, fuel inflationary pressures,\" Hollingsworth said. A further contributor is the acceleration and accentuation of the trends of decarbonization and deglobalization brought about by the war in Ukraine, he added, since both are likely to heighten medium-term inflationary pressures. BNP maintains that the shift in the inflation regime is not just about where price increases settle, but the volatility of inflation that will be emphasized by big swings over the next one to two years. \"Admittedly, we think inflation volatility is still likely to fall from its current extremely high levels. However, we do not expect it to return to the sorts of levels that characterised the 'great moderation',\" Hollingsworth said.", "label": "human"}

He underscored the importance of judges serving without fear or favor, and without political influence or interference, during his speech at the American Bar Association's annual meeting in San Francisco.\n\nRoberts acknowledged the risks associated with serving on the bench and described judges as an essential component of the country's justice system. \"Judges serve their communities and nation, and the community and nation rely on their ability to serve freely from fear,\" he stated. \"The threats to judges and their safety must be taken seriously, and protective measures should be implemented whenever necessary.\"\n\nThis comment came in the wake of several recent incidents in which judges were targeted by individuals with grievances against the court system. For instance, in October, a man was arrested in Ohio for threatening to kill a judge who had issued a ruling he didn't like. Similarly, in September, a man was arrested in Arizona for threatening to kill three judges who had overturned his conviction.\n\nThe threats have been underscored by the killing of two Colorado judges in December 2014 by a man who had a history of filing court complaints. Roberts also discussed the importance of protecting the independence of the judicial branch of government, which he said is threatened by the increasing politicization of the courts.\n\n\"The independence of the judiciary must be safeguarded to ensure that judges serve without fear or favor, and without political influence or interference,\" Roberts said. He urged the American Bar Association to help \"ensure that judges' and potential judges' decisions and the court system that they serve remain untainted by partisan interests and serve the public interest.\"\n\nRoberts emphasized the need for safeguards to protect the independence of the judicial branch, including measures to ensure that judges are not influenced by political, financial, or any other interests. He also called on the bar association to create a committee to increase public awareness of the roles and responsibilities of judges, as well as the importance of their independence.\n\n\"It is essential for all of us to understand the importance of judicial independence and to remember that judges serve the public and the interests of justice,\" Roberts said. His comments come at a time when there has been a growing focus on judicial independence and safety in the wake of several high-profile incidents involving threats and violence against judges in recent years.\n\nIn May, the Supreme Court issued a sweeping opinion that ruled that judges have a constitutional duty to protect the public from threats and to ensure the safety of those who appear in their courtrooms. The court's decision held that judges have a duty to take reasonable steps to protect the physical safety of court staff, visitors, and other participants.\n\nRoberts emphasized the importance of judicial safety and called on the bar association to help spread the message. \"I urge the ABA to join me in raising awareness of the dangers facing judges and the need to protect their safety,\" Roberts said. \"I call on all members of the judiciary, including state and local courts, to take appropriate precautions.\"", "label": "machine"}

A recent IATT survey of 8,058 Thai individuals from diverse backgrounds found that 34.6% of respondents would \"never travel again\" due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This percentage is significantly higher than the global average of 22%.\n\nThe findings indicate a profound impact on people's attitudes towards travel in Thailand. IATT CEO Edward Yee expressed concern, stating that the pandemic's effects on travel willingness could significantly affect the Thai tourism industry's recovery. The most common reasons for not wanting to travel again were concerns about health and safety, contracting COVID-19, and the economic impact of the pandemic.\n\nThese results align with a Triptoix survey, which found that 43% of Thai respondents were not planning to travel in 2021, and only 11% were planning to travel overseas. To combat these trends, the Thai government has implemented initiatives, including a $2.8 billion tourism stimulus package and the Thailand Clean and Safe Corridor, which allows travelers from low-risk countries to enter the country without quarantine. The government has also launched the 'We Travel Again' campaign to encourage safe and responsible travel.\n\nThe pandemic's impact on the Thai tourism industry is substantial, with a 77% year-on-year decline in tourist arrivals in the first quarter of 2020 and a 90% decline in the second quarter. This has had a devastating effect on the country's economy, with the Thai economy projected to contract by as much as 8% in 2020.\n\nIt is evident that the pandemic has had a lasting impact on people's attitudes towards travel in Thailand, and the country will need to work diligently to encourage people to start traveling again.

{"text": "For years, I've been accustomed to incorporating a certain substance into my daily routine. As a sociable individual, I found it effortless to mingle over a glass of a certain beverage or a mixed drink. Consequently, I had been seeking a means to curtail my consumption and explore a lifestyle sans the substance. When I discovered a month-long initiative to abstain from the substance in the new year, I deemed it the ideal opportunity to give it a try.\n\nThe objective was to provide my liver a respite while also experimenting with a novel lifestyle. What I didn't anticipate was the profound difference life could be without the crutch of the substance. Would I be able to have an equivalent amount of fun? Would I be able to navigate social events with the same ease?\n\nIt transpired that I could. Here's how I managed to abstain from the substance for an entire month\u2014and how you can do it too.\n\n1. Understand the reasoning behind your actions\n\nI didn't want to participate in the initiative merely for the sake of it\u2014I wanted to ensure that I had a strong purpose for abstaining from the substance. Why was I doing this? What did I hope to derive from it?\n\nFor me, it was to challenge myself and discover what life was like without the substance. I wanted to prove to myself that I could still have enjoyable experiences and socialize without relying on the substance. It was also a means to conserve funds and kickstart my health and wellness objectives.\n\nKnowing my purpose made it simpler to stay motivated and adhere to the challenge.\n\n2. Be truthful with yourself and others\n\nWhen I disclosed my decision to abstain from the substance to others, some were enthusiastic about joining me, while others thought I was being imprudent. Regardless of the response, I remained committed to my decision.\n\nI was also truthful with myself about my motivations and expectations. I had to regularly check in with myself to ensure that I was staying on track.\n\n3. Discover alternative methods of socialization\n\nSince my companions and I typically gathered over the substance, I had to find alternative ways to socialize. Instead of visiting the bar, we went on hikes, engaged in ice skating, and met for coffee or juice.\n\nWe also organized game nights at someone's residence or participated in sober gatherings. There are numerous sober events, such as sober music festivals, that are enjoyable and social.\n\n4. Focus on the benefits\n\nIt was challenging to abstain from the substance in social situations, but I kept reminding myself of the benefits. I was saving funds, sleeping better, and feeling more energized. I was also having more meaningful conversations because I wasn't clouded by the substance.\n\nI also compiled a list of my favorite non-substance beverages, such as Kombucha, iced tea, and mocktails, so I always had something to order when I went out.\n\n5. Find support\n\nI found that having a support system was extremely helpful in staying motivated. I connected with a few of my friends who were also participating in the initiative, and we'd regularly check in to see how we were progressing. We also made a pact that if one of us slipped up, we'd all pick ourselves back up and start again.\n\n6. Celebrate your achievements\n\nI made it through the entire month and was feeling extremely proud of myself. I celebrated by recording all the things that I accomplished and all the benefits that I experienced. This helped me stay motivated and kept me on track.\n\nIt also felt great to know that I could actually be in social situations and still have enjoyable experiences without relying on the substance. It made me realize that I could form meaningful connections with people and have fun without needing the substance to do it.\n\nIn conclusion, the initiative was a fantastic challenge for me, and it taught me a great deal about myself. I still occasionally enjoy a certain beverage, but this experience has definitely altered my consumption habits.\n\nI'm now much more aware of when I'm reaching for the substance out of habit, and I'm more mindful of the benefits of choosing not to. Hopefully, my experience can assist you if you're also attempting to reduce your consumption. Good luck!", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "But even with the huge win in 2022, short sellers still lag in recent history. In the past five years, an average annual return for short sellers was a loss of 4.4% while the Dow gained 6.8%, the S&P 500 rose 9.3% and the Nasdaq climbed 12.5%.\n\nShorted stocks had a return of 30.8% in 2022, said Ihor Dusaniwsky, the firm's managing director of predictive analytics. That means short sellers outperformed the broader market, which suffered its biggest losses since 2008. The Dow Jones Industrial Average , S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lost 8.8%, 19.4% and 33.1%, respectively, last year.\n\nWhen an investor sells a stock \"short\" they borrow shares from a broker and sell them in hopes of buying the stock back later at a lower price. It's a tactic that does best when the broader market is hurting. Short seller returns came in below the major indexes when the market gained value in 2019 through 2021, but beat the averages when they ended the year down in 2018.\n\nIt's worth noting that the total amount shorted last year was below 2021, when the $1 trillion threshold was broken, but higher than in 2018 through 2020.\n\nShort sellers still needed to be good stock pickers in 2022 as different sectors and individual holdings could produce vastly different results, Dusaniwsky said.\n\nFor instance, the best sector to short last year was beat down communication services stocks, which produced a return on shorted holdings of 56.7%. Energy was the worst, and posted a 28% loss on shorted holdings, S3 Partners said.\n\nShort- and long-term performance are typically inversed. That's because investors usually move short on holdings that they expect to lose value, so energy \u2014 which was the only winning S&P 500 sector in 2022 \u2014 would not be a target for shorting as investors watched share values rise despite the broader market's decline.\n\nAnd choosing sector orientation is \"only half the battle\" given the variety of stocks within each one. Within consumer staples, for example, Beyond Meat had the biggest return on short selling at 128.2%. French fry producer Lamb Weston was the least profitable in its sector, and lost 43.9%.\n\nCarvana , which was beat down as used car demand slid, had the best short performance of all stocks with at least $100 million in short interest, recording a 377.6% gain.\n\nOn the flip side, Madrigal Pharma was the worst to short.

The National Weather Service reports that the snowpack has been increasing since October 2020, with significant amounts falling since 2021.\n\nThe high snowpack is a positive sign for California's water supply, as it's expected to lead to higher groundwater levels and more water entering reservoirs.

Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, sworn in for a second term Sunday, called the sentencing last week of two men convicted of plotting to kidnap her \u201cjust,\u201d while urging both parties to confront threats and violent rhetoric.\n\n\u201cWhether it is someone harassing Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh or Congressman Fred Upton here in Michigan, or me, or our attorney general, or secretary of state, it\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins in an interview the day she was sworn in. \u201cBut I do think it\u2019s important that people on both sides of the aisle, who care more about our democracy than their political agenda, stand up and take it on.\u201d\n\nThirteen people were charged in the kidnapping plot, with the group discussing sending a bomb to the governor. The co-leaders of the plot were sentenced last week to 16 years and nearly 20 years in federal prison, respectively, after prosecutors had sought a life sentence in both their cases.\n\nWhitmer, who had dealt with an unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic and issued stay-at-home orders that made her a target, expressed concern over how the plot has been described, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s a tendency to minimize some of these threats.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t planning to ransom me, they weren\u2019t going to keep me, they were planning to assassinate me. And the plot has been covered as a kidnapping plot,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was one person who showed up on, you know, on a Supreme Court justice\u2019s lawn and turned himself in, and it was covered as an assassination attempt. And so I think that when you look at the facts of both of those, and you see how differently they\u2019re covered, I do, you know, have concern about the language that we use, especially when women are a target as opposed to men.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department charged the man who was arrested near Kavanaugh\u2019s house in Maryland with attempting or threatening to kidnap or murder a US judge.\n\nWhitmer, first elected governor in 2018, said the threat against her had \u201cchanged how I assess going into situations\u201d and \u201cchanged my concern for all the people around me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would be lying if I told you I was unfazed,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI think it\u2019s important to understand, I\u2019m an ordinary person. I\u2019ve got an extraordinary job and have served in extraordinary times. I\u2019m a mom. I\u2019m a daughter.\u201d\n\nAfter the challenges of the past few years, Whitmer said she\u2019s \u201cexcited\u201d about starting a new term.\n\n\u201cThere was so much chaos, politically and in the environment, I didn\u2019t know if I would, you know, get an opportunity to serve for four more years,\u201d the Democratic governor said. \u201cI never imagined I\u2019d win by almost 11 points and come in with a whole new legislature.\u201d\n\nWhitmer sailed to a resounding victory in November, beating her Republican challenger Tudor Dixon 55% to 44%, while Democrats also won a majority in the Michigan legislature \u2013 giving them control of both chambers and the governorship for the first time in nearly four decades. Among her top priorities, Whitmer listed public education, economic development, protecting the Great Lakes and ensuring people have access to safe drinking water and high-speed internet. She also mentioned repealing the retirement tax that Republicans passed last legislature and getting a 1931 state law banning abortion \u201coff the books.\u201d\n\nWith her reelection in a pivotal swing state, Whitmer has furthered cemented her status as a national figure in the Democratic Party, but she has brushed off speculation about a 2024 White House bid while not completely closing the door to running for something else down the line.\n\n\u201cI think doing my job well is the best way that I can contribute to the national Democratic Party \u2013 is to be able to be someone that they can point to and say, \u2018This is what happens when you elect Democrats,\u2019\u201d she said, reflecting on how her 2022 campaign \u201ctalked about abortion in the most personal terms\u201d and how she thinks that contributed to Democrats\u2019 success.\n\nShe anticipates President Joe Biden running for the White House again in 2024, telling CNN that he would have her \u201centhusiastic support\u201d if he does.\n\n\u201cI do not have plans to run for anything other than to spend the next four years serving this state as governor with a majority Democratic legislature for the first time in a long time,\u201d Whitmer said, while also noting that she felt similarly when she left the state legislature in 2015, only later to run for governor in 2018.\n\n\u201cI know enough about myself to know if there is something that needs to get done, and if there\u2019s a role I can play, I will want to play it,\u201d she said.\n\nBut regardless of whether she runs for something again or not, Whitmer said she \u201cwill stay engaged one way or another,\u201d reflecting on what\u2019s to come after the governor\u2019s mansion. \u201cMichigan will always play an outsized role in the national politics, so I look forward to making sure that our voices are impactful and Michigan gets what we need and we\u2019ve got leaders who serve every person.\u201d", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Microsoft zou naar verluidt bezig zijn om AI-chatbot ChatGPT in zoekmachine Bing te integreren.\n\nDe chatbot van maker OpenAI wordt door experts al aangeduid als mogelijke bedreiging voor Google.\n\nHoe de integratie van ChatGPT zou moeten werken, is nog niet duidelijk.\n\nLees ook: ChatGPT is niet krachtig genoeg en veel te duur om de concurrentie met Google aan te gaan\n\nDe hype die momenteel gaande is rond de door kunstmatige intelligentie aangestuurde chatbot ChatGPT draait vooral om het feit dat experts denken dat deze applicatie mogelijk in de toekomst Google van de internettroon kan stoten.\n\nDe vragen die ChatGPT kan beantwoorden, zouden volgens sommigen een natuurlijker en beter alternatief zijn voor de zoekresultaten die Google ophoest.\n\nMogelijk ziet Microsoft die potentie ook, want volgens The Information zou de techgigant uit Redmond bezig zijn op de chatbot te integreren in zoekmachine Bing. Hoe dit precies moet gaan werken, is niet helemaal duidelijk, maar het is op zijn minst interessant te noemen.\n\nZeker omdat er ook veel tegenstanders zijn voor het gebruik van ChatGPT als vervanging voor de zoekfunctie van Google. Er zijn al ontelbaar veel voorbeelden op het internet verschenen waarin de chatbot foutieve informatie deelt alsof het de waarheid is.\n\nWaar Google bij een zoekvraag geen direct antwoord geeft, maar een selectie maakt van bronnen met links naar sites die mogelijk betrouwbare antwoorden kunnen geven, geeft ChatGPT zelf direct antwoorden zonder bronvermelding. ChatGPT maakt daarbij geen afweging tussen betrouwbare en dubieuze antwoorden.\n\nOok de CEO van OpenAI, maker van ChatGPT, zegt dat de chatbot niet geschikt is als alternatief voor internetzoekmachines. Al houdt hij natuurlijk een slag om de arm en zegt hij dat dit voor nu het geval is. In de toekomst zou het dus wellicht wel kunnen.\n\nReactie van Google?\n\nOf Google met een tweede 'Code Rood' reageert op dit nieuws, weten we nog niet. Duidelijk is wel dat het zoekmachinebedrijf naar verluidt alles op alles zet om eigen toepassingen van artificial intelligence aanzienlijk te verbeteren in de aankomende periode. Vooralsnog zou het bedrijf nog geen concurrent van ChatGPT willen introduceren uit angst voor reputatieschade.\n\nOf zoekmachine Bing van Microsoft met de integratie van ChatGPT ineens een geduchte concurrent wordt van Google, valt nog te bezien. Het marktaandeel van Google is 30 keer groter dan dat van Bing (90 procent versus 3 procent).\n\nDaarnaast werkt Google al jaren met kunstmatige intelligentie om de zoekresultaten te verbeteren. De antwoorden op zoekvragen worden ook gegenereerd met behulp van kunstmatige intelligentie. Alleen verwijst Google hierbij naar de geselecteerde bron, in plaats van dat de software een antwoord in eigen woorden omschrijft.\n\nDe mogelijke integratie van ChatGPT in Bing is niet heel erg verrassend, gelet op de banden tussen softwaregigant Microsoft en startup OpenAI. Niet alleen draait ChatGPT voor een prikkie op Azure-servers van Microsoft, ook ontving de startup investeringen van in totaal 1 miljard dollar van Microsoft. Daarnaast gebruikt Microsoft al toepassingen die zijn ontwikkeld door OpenAI in onderdelen van het Windows-besturingssysteem.", "label": "human"}

Firing it, The Times reported, costs $500,000.\n\nBut Mathieu Boul\u00e8gue, a Russia expert at London's Chatham House, told the newspaper that the cost was \"irrelevant as long as the West keeps providing military assistance to Ukraine.\"\n\nIn December, the US announced it would send its most advanced missile-defense system, the Patriot, to Ukraine.\n\nBut officials have said this is no silver bullet \u2014 precisely because of the cost difference between launching a cheap Iranian drone and defending against it with a top-of-the-line Patriot missile.\n\nMark Cancian and Tom Karako, military experts at the Center for Strategic and International Studies \u2014 who priced the Shahed drone at about $50,000, rather than $20,000 \u2014 wrote about the issue in December: \"High-value Russian aircraft and ballistic missiles would be appropriate targets.\n\n\"Shooting $4 million missiles at $250,000 Russian cruise missiles might be justified if those missiles would hit sensitive targets.

{"text": "NEW YORK, Dec 23 (Reuters) - A rough year for U.S. stocks is winding down, but the market\u2019s pain may be far from over, as investors brace for an expected recession in 2023.\n\nWith only a handful of trading days left in 2022, the benchmark S&P 500 index (.SPX) is down 19.8% year-to-date and headed for its biggest annual decline since 2008, as the Federal Reserve mounts its most aggressive monetary policy tightening cycle in decades to fight surging inflation.\n\nWhile inflation is yet to be tamed, Wall Street's focus is shifting to the potential consequence of the Fed\u2019s rate hikes: a 2023 economic slowdown.\n\nFirms projecting at least a mild recession include BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, Barclays and Oxford Economics. Fund managers in a BofA Global Research survey named a deep global recession and persistently high inflation as the market\u2019s biggest risks, with a net 68% forecasting a downturn as likely in the next year.\n\nRecession worries are also filtering into asset prices, while the Treasury yield curve has been inverted since early 2022, a signal that has preceded past downturns.\n\n\"The consensus is pretty clear that there is going to be a recession in 2023,\" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services. \"The issue is how much has the market already discounted a recession, and that\u2019s where it gets a little bit thornier.\"\n\nConcerns that the Fed will maintain its hawkish stance helped drive the S&P 500 down 1.45% on Thursday.\n\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research, the official arbiter of recessions, typically declares them in hindsight, and consistent job growth this year makes it less likely that a recession has already started.\n\nIf a recession starts next year, stocks could be set for another swoon: A bear market has never bottomed before the beginning of a recession, historic data showed.\n\n\"If we\u2019re not in a recession now but we\u2019re going into one that would mean that a retest of the October lows and a break of them is quite possible in the first half of the year,\u201d said Ed Clissold, chief U.S. strategist at Ned Davis Research.\n\nThe S&P 500 marked a 2022 closing low of 3,577.03 in October, just over 6% below its current level.\n\nStocks perform poorly during economic downturns, with the S&P 500 falling an average of 29% during recessions since World War Two, according to Truist Advisory Services. The index was down just over 25% in October from its Jan. 3 record closing high.\n\nStocks could also see a bigger move than usual next year. The S&P 500 has swung by at least 10% in either direction in the year after a decline of 15% or more, according to Bespoke Investment Group.\n\nReuters Graphics\n\nEARNINGS OVERESTIMATED?\n\nInvestors are also gauging to what degree slowing growth has been factored into corporate earnings.\n\nConsensus analyst estimates project S&P 500 earnings to rise about 5% in 2023, and to post at least a slim year-over-year gain in every quarter next year, according to Refinitiv IBES.\n\nYet earnings fall by an average annual rate of 24% during recessions, according to Clissold, leaving plenty of downside for profits if a slowdown hits.\n\n\u201cStocks generally follow earnings,\" said Matt Peron, director of research at Janus Henderson Investors. \u201cIf rate hikes take about a year to flow through the system, we are still six months away from the real teeth of it.\u201d\n\nOne wild card may be whether consumer prices, which rose less than expected in November for a second straight month, subside quickly enough to allow the Fed to stop raising rates as soon as Wall Street anticipates.\n\nWhile many investors believe rates will peak sometime in the middle of 2023, policymakers earlier this month said the benchmark interest rate will need to rise next year to a higher level than previously anticipated to cool consumer prices.\n\n\u201cThe market focus is shifting from inflation concerns to growth concerns,\u201d said Mona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones. \"If there are any inflationary shocks that are unforeseen, that will derail the narrative.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, strategists polled by Reuters last month expect the S&P 500 to end 2023 at 4,200, some 10% above current levels.\n\nOne way that could happen is if a recession hits early in 2023 and ends quickly. Bear markets on average have bottomed four months before the end of a recession, according to Clissold, of Ned Davis.\n\nIf a recession finishes by the end of 2023, \u201cby the time we get into the second half of the year, we could be looking at a new bull market,\u201d he said.\n\nReporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Leslie Adler\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The automotive industry is undergoing a profound transformation as cars become increasingly reliant on cloud-based data. This shift will irreversibly alter the car-buying experience and the way dealerships operate.\n\nHistorically, the car-buying process has been a static affair. Customers would visit a dealership, test drive a car, negotiate the price, and then take it home. However, the past few years have seen a significant transformation driven by technological advancements and data influx.\n\nAutomakers have recognized the need to integrate technology to remain competitive. Many now offer apps that enable customers to research, compare, and purchase cars remotely. This allows customers to make informed decisions and secure the best deals before stepping foot in a dealership.\n\nThe rise of electric vehicles and autonomous driving has also had a profound impact. Electric cars require less maintenance and generate valuable data that can be used to better understand customer preferences and driving habits.\n\nThe increasing adoption of self-driving technology has led to the emergence of new business models. Consumers can now purchase cars that can drive themselves, eliminating the need for a driver's license. Autonomous vehicles are even being tested on public roads in some cities, forcing car companies to rethink their strategies.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has also revolutionized the car-buying process. AI can provide personalized recommendations, predict optimal prices, and even negotiate on behalf of customers.\n\nThe most significant change, however, is the shift towards subscription-based models. Instead of buying a car outright, customers can now rent cars on a short-term or long-term basis. This approach allows consumers to access the cars they want without the upfront costs associated with ownership.\n\nThese changes have had a profound impact on the car-buying process and dealership operations. Car companies are focusing on online presence, customer service, and investing in technologies like AI, self-driving cars, and subscription models to remain competitive.\n\nIt is clear that the car-buying process is undergoing a seismic shift, and it is unlikely to revert to its pre-transformation state.

In some cases, that has meant taking a pay cut. But Sandy Anuras, who recently joined home solar provider Sunrun as its chief technology officer, says a big paycheck sometimes comes with a price. \"The tech giants have had these huge compensation packages. And it's hard to say no to a huge compensation package,\" Anuras told CNBC. \"You just realize there's a little bit more to life than maxing out your comp package. And I think people are realizing that now \u2014 and especially with some of the decisions that their companies have made to prioritize profits over democracy, for example.\" Before starting at Sunrun in March, Anuras worked at Expedia for almost three years. She believes traveling is good for society, as people who travel often experience an expanded perspective and greater compassion toward strangers. But helping people book travel efficiently did not give Anuras the internal satisfaction she had when she worked at Blokable, a startup working to make affordable housing readily available.\n\nThere's a little bit more to life than maxing out your comp package.

Not only is climate change an existential-level threat to humanity, it is especially dangerous for the poorest communities around the world. \"Spending my time in that space is just so important,\" she said. That's how it was for software engineer Tom Melendez, too. He worked at Google for five years before leaving in 2019 to take a job at MethaneSAT, an affiliate of the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, which processes satellite data to measure emissions of methane, an especially potent greenhouse gas. \"I was proud to be at Google. While I was there, especially in the beginning, I enjoyed the work I was doing,\" Melendez told CNBC. But eventually he started to feel disenchanted. \"At the end of the day, you can't help but feel like the sole purpose of this is really just to make money. I am not making anything better \u2014 or not really. The metrics that I'm rated on are important to the company, but they're not really important to me.\" He has two kids who are now 12 and 16 years old and he thinks about what he's leaving the next generation. \"I genuinely am afraid of the world that we're leaving these folks and what can I do to help? And me pushing bytes around at Google\" was not it, he said. Google declined to comment.\n\nTom Melendez, the senior engineering director at MethaneSAT, and his son, Jaxon. Photo courtesy Tom Melendez\n\nBefore he was employed at Google, Melendez worked with satellite data at a startup, Skybox Imaging. That experience helped him land his current gig, but he hasn't always thought of himself as a climate warrior. \"I didn't necessarily grow up as an environmentalist, or anything like that. I was just trying to live my life,\" he told CNBC. He grew up in a working class, politically purple part of Long Island, New York, where his family and friends saw environmental regulations as a nuisance that increases complexity and costs for businesses. Melendez wanted to help give people like his childhood peers the data and tools to process the facts on their own. \"I do feel a need to be able to turn this data into something that everybody can understand and not be so afraid of,\" Melendez said. \"I've put effort into this in my current work of \u2014 how to make this consumable to those folks that I grew up with? How do I get them to understand that this is a problem?\"\n\nEventually, it just got to the point where I couldn't justify to myself why I'm still doing something that isn't climate. Eugene Kirpichov Founder and CEO, Work On Climate\n\nBecause he had earned a high Google salary for years and owned his home, he was financially able to take the step-down in pay that came with his move to MethaneSAT. Having a steady housing situation ends up being a key factor in whether people can move to a lower salary in exchange for work they find meaningful.\n\nHelping disgruntled techies make the jump\n\nAs more techies consider jumping to careers fighting climate change, resources are popping up to help them make the switch. For example, since the climate jobs website Climatebase launched in June 2020, more than 600,000 people have used it, poring over more than than 40,000 job listings from more than 3,000 climate tech companies and environmental organizations, according to co-founder Evan Hynes. Climatebase has also had over 3,000 applications for an educational fellowship the company runs. (Disclosure: I was one of the fellows in the founding fellowship earlier in 2022.) Work On Climate, a non-profit working to help people find jobs in climate, has a Slack channel with more than 10,000 members, up more than fourfold in the last year, said the list's co-founder, Eugene Kirpichov.\n\nEugene Kirpichov, co-founder and CEO of Work on Climate Photo courtesy Eugene Kirpichov, co-founder and CEO of Work on Climate\n\nBefore launching Work On Climate, Kirpichov was employed at Google for eight years, where he worked on big data and machine-learning systems. He liked his job there. \"Academically, it was fascinating, super interesting problems, really great colleagues,\" he told CNBC. Then Kirpichov watched the documentary \"An Inconvenient Truth\" on a plane flight, and was engrossed enough to watch the sequel, \"An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power\" on the flight back. He educated himself about the topic further by asking questions of people who knew more about climate change than he did, friends who are environmental scientists and energy scientists, and reading books. \"Eventually, it just got to the point where I couldn't justify to myself why I'm still doing something that isn't climate,\" Kirpichov told CNBC. \"It got me into a pretty anxious and unsettled state.\" Kirpichov decided to leave Google to pursue work full time on climate and he shared the email he wrote to colleagues on LinkedIn: \"The reason I'm leaving is because the scale, urgency and tragedy of climate change are so immense that I can no longer justify to myself working on anything else, no matter how interesting or lucrative, until it's fixed,\" Kirpichov wrote. \"I'd be lying if I didn't say that I think others, who have the privilege of being able to do so, should follow suit. I like to frame the problem positively as 'how much can we save,' and every one of us can have a hand in saving something.\"\n\nResponse to the letter was effusive. \"It turns out that there are just so many people who are in the same boat,\" Kirpichov told CNBC. While many people shared a similarly urgent desire to work in climate, they didn't know what exactly they could do. \"Most people still think that working in climate is calling your representatives and walking around with strongly worded banners,\" he said. Hearing the feedback helped Kirpichov realize there was a need to help other people find jobs in the space. James Newsome, now chief data officer at carbon accounting software company Persefoni, was one of those people who didn't know whether or how his skill set could translate to a climate job.\n\nJames Newsome, Chief Data Officer, Persefoni Photo courtesy James Newsome, Persefoni\n\n\"When I was growing up in the '90s, early 2000s, the only people you saw in climate were these climate scientists with Ph.D.s,\" Newsome told CNBC. So when Kentaro Kawamori, co-founder and CEO of Persefoni, approached Newsome and told him about building a climate disclosure SaaS platform, Newsome's response was: \"Well, I think it's awesome. But I'm not a climate scientist.\" Kawamori told him, \"This is a data problem that we're solving.\" And Newsome definitely knows data. \"Back in 2006, I just wanted to trade stocks. Warren Buffett was somebody I admired,\" Newsome told CNBC. He started reading about people who use quantitative analysis to trade stocks, \"with some magical algorithm\" and was sure that he was onto the wave of the future. He had graduated with a masters in accounting from the University of Phoenix but started studying statistics, mathematics and computer science on his own time. He worked at Insight, an IT services and consulting company, for six years and ended up running the business intelligence group there, which included both data science and data engineering. \"I definitely enjoyed it,\" Newsome said, but after a while he started to lose his passion for the work. \"You kind of start feeling like a factory,.\" Now, working at Persefoni gives Newsome a newfound sense of purpose, letting him align his personal values with his work values. As an executive responsible for hiring and inspiring, he's found a lot of other tech workers craving the same kind of change. Since starting with Persefoni in 2020, Newsome has hired about 40 engineers, and he's been able to compete for talent with the top tech companies. \"This is a wildly sought after skill set. You have Google, Amazon paying people $300,000 a year,\" Newsome said.\n\nBrian Lafayette, head of business strategy at Overstory Photo courtesy Brian Lafayette\n\n'There's starting to be almost a playbook now'\n\nThat kind of skill set translation brought Brian Lafayette to Overstory, a tech startup that uses satellite data to monitor vegetation growth. Overstory's technology is used by the Rainforest Alliance to monitor forest growth and utility companies concerned about electric wires running through dry leaves and causing wildfires. Lafayette grew up in Burlington, Vermont, with a forest in the backyard, a lake at the bottom of the street and not a whole lot of big business around. His goal, however, was to work for the kind of business that changes the way people live and work. \"Doesn't everybody want to work in tech?\" he asked a bit rhetorically, in a conversation with CNBC. So after working in management consulting, he landed a job at event planning platform Meetup in 2014. There, he climbed the ranks from running the data analysis and strategy team to becoming the vice president of revenue, where he was part of the team that helped sell the company to WeWork. But as WeWork started imploding, Meetup (among many other divisions of the company) had to lay off significant portions of the staff. Those kind of layoffs create a \"massive hit\" to morale. \"It just feels terrible,\" Lafayette told CNBC. He knew it was time to move jobs.\n\nThere's just no bigger problem in the world than climate change. It's the defining problem of our generation. Brian Lafayette Head of business strategy, Overstory\n\nOne thing that Lafayette learned at Meetup was the joy of working for a company that makes the world better in some way -- in that case, helping people find community was a way to help make people happier. \"I couldn't go work for a startup that was building something in the marketing stack. I can't get excited about that,\" Lafayette said. When he stepped back to assess his next step, he had the same realization as many others who have made the jump: \"There's just no bigger problem in the world than climate change,\" he told CNBC. \"It's existential.\" When he was ready to make the move to a climate startup, Lafayette reached out to a friend in his network who had previously made a similar transition. \"There's starting to be almost a playbook now,\" Lafayette said. \"I talked to somebody who had already done it before, she helped me and showed me all the different resources that were available.\" His friend also talked him out of going back to school before making the switch. Instead, Lafayette primed himself for the transition by taking a climate boot camp course, Terra.do, and listened to \"My Climate Journey,\" a popular podcast. Now, Lafayette is the head of business strategy at Overstory. While the work is different, Lafayette found his previous employment experience set him up to be successful at Overstory. \"It's still the same thing. It's just business, it's just with a different focus,\" Lafayette said. \"All the same skills are needed.\" Having the opportunity to develop this kind of skill set in the first place is a privilege, according to Sunrun's Anuras. \"I was thinking about my family, being from Thailand and Southeast Asia. We know Southeast Asia is going to get hit really hard with climate change. And so I'm really thinking a lot about folks who don't have the privilege that I have, where I can say, 'Oh, I'm going to be in Seattle, where it is so cool and climate change is not impacting us in such a severe way,'\" Anuras told CNBC. \"As a privileged technologist, where should I be spending my life?\" Anuras said. As she realized that Anuras realized she can use her skills to combat climate change, the answers to her own questions became increasingly clear. \"What problems do I want to look back and say I helped solve: One of the greatest problems humanity has faced, or I worked on selling some widgets in the metaverse? It just didn't compute for me.\"", "label": "human"}

If they'd stopped in Omaha on the drive from New York to Seattle and he'd said, 'What do you think of this idea?' I would have said, 'Good luck, Jeff.'\" (Buffett was referring to Amazon's unlikely evolution from an online bookseller to a technology titan under founder Jeff Bezos.)\n\n8. \"Sometimes the stock market is quite investment-oriented, and other times it's almost totally a casino, a gambling parlor \u2014 and that existed to an extraordinary degree in the last couple of years, encouraged by Wall Street.\"\n\n9. \"If you told me you owned all of the bitcoin in the world, and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn't take it because what would I do with it?

{"text": "In the digital era, safeguarding one's online persona is paramount. As cybercrime and hacking escalate, it's crucial to implement measures to safeguard personal data. A password manager is an effective way to achieve this.\n\nA password manager is a software application that enables users to securely store and access their online account credentials. By consolidating all passwords in a single, secure location, users can access their accounts with a single, robust master password, obviating the need to recall multiple weak passwords.\n\nThe popularity of password managers has surged as individuals become increasingly aware of the importance of protecting their online identities. The first password manager was introduced in 1998, but its adoption has accelerated in recent years due to the rise of cybercrime and the need for enhanced security.\n\nUtilizing a password manager offers numerous benefits. Firstly, it eliminates the need to remember multiple passwords, replacing them with a single, strong password. This simplifies account security and reduces the likelihood of compromised credentials.\n\nSecondly, password managers encrypt stored passwords, rendering them inaccessible to unauthorized parties, even if they manage to obtain them. This significantly hinders hackers' ability to access sensitive data.\n\nLastly, many password managers offer additional features, such as two-factor authentication and secure sharing. Two-factor authentication requires two forms of verification, like a code sent to a mobile device, to access accounts. Secure sharing enables users to share passwords securely with others, such as family members, without risking password theft.\n\nWhile password managers offer numerous benefits, they also present some risks. For instance, forgetting the master password can render account access impossible. It's essential to choose a strong, memorable password and store it safely.\n\nSelecting a reputable password manager is also crucial, as there are many options available. It's vital to conduct thorough research and choose a manager with a solid reputation. Regularly updating the password manager is also essential to ensure timely application of security updates.\n\nIn conclusion, using a password manager can be an effective means of safeguarding online identities. By consolidating passwords and storing them in an encrypted format, users can simplify account security and reduce the risk of compromised credentials. However, it's essential to choose a reputable password manager and regularly update it to ensure optimal security.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "For nearly 70 years, a certain global entity maintained a steadfast presence in Eastern Europe and served as a counterbalance to the United States in international politics. Its collapse in 1991 sent shockwaves throughout the global system.\n\nA trio of American scholars has posited that one key factor in the entity's downfall was the overwhelming presence of senior individuals in its governing body and economic framework.\n\nThe three authors, Zachary Karabell, Stephen Kotkin, and Jonathan Becker, penned their paper for the Harvard Kennedy School's Institute for International Affairs. They contend that the entity's gerontocratic system of leadership, characterized by power concentration among older individuals, acted as a significant brake on its economy and progress.\n\nThe authors drew upon the traditional concept of gerontocracy to support their argument. This refers to a form of government where rulers are predominantly elderly and their decisions are influenced by the concerns, ideologies, and biases of their age group.\n\nThe entity in question had a gerontocratic system of government, with leaders predominantly in their 70s, 80s, and 90s. These aging politicians were resolutely opposed to free market reforms and open economic policies.\n\nThe paper highlights numerous examples of the gerontocracy's influence. For instance, the entity's economy continued to be centrally planned, despite being proven inefficient and ineffective. Leaders also refused to implement market reforms that would have boosted productivity.\n\nThe authors further argue that the entity was \"abnormally fixated on the past\" and that the gerontocratic leaders lacked the energy and vision to enact bold reforms.\n\nThey point out that the entity experienced a population boom in the 1960s and 1970s, but the gerontocracy's reluctance to invest in new technologies and lack of vision meant the country missed out on opportunities to reap the benefits of its population growth.\n\nThe authors conclude that the entity's downfall serves as a warning to other nations, including the United States. They argue that the presence of an \"elderly leadership class\" in the United States could hinder progress and prevent the country from capitalizing on future opportunities.\n\nThe paper has sparked debate among historians and political analysts. Some have argued that the entity's collapse was caused by a variety of factors, including its suppression of free speech and costly military ventures.\n\nOthers, however, have posited that the gerontocratic system was a significant factor. The paper's authors hope that their work will encourage governments worldwide to ensure their economic policies are responsive to the challenges of the future.", "label": "machine"}

The analyst emphasized the importance of solar, storage, and electric vehicles, citing their potential for significant growth.\n\nWhile risks remain, such as the potential for policy changes, the report emphasized that the broader trends in clean energy have been established and will continue to drive growth. The analyst noted that the sector has already experienced strong growth in 2020, with solar stocks leading the way with a 28.7% gain. Storage stocks have also seen significant growth, with a 18.7% increase in 2020.\n\nThe report predicted that electric vehicle stocks, which have lagged behind their peers in 2020, will experience a significant upside in 2021. The analyst attributed this growth to increased demand from automakers and government support.\n\nOverall, the report concluded that clean energy stocks will remain a significant winner in 2021, despite broader market uncertainties. The analyst advised investors to seek out stocks with structural tailwinds, as the sector continues to grow in the coming year.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "As the temperature drops, it's time to indulge in rich, velvety textures, raise the thermostat, and settle in for some snug gaming sessions. While the thermometer outside may be plummeting, you can always rely on video games to transport you to distant, fantastical realms or photorealistic environments. Many of these games boast breathtaking visuals, with snow being one of the most striking sights you can experience in the virtual world.\n\nFrom the gentle, calming snow of Stardew Valley to the icy blasts of The Last of Us Part II, the snow in video games can take many forms. So, with that, here's our roundup of some of the most striking uses of snow in games.\n\n1. Stardew Valley\n\nThis peaceful and calming farming simulator is one of the most charming titles on the market. The snow that settles in Stardew Valley creates a beautiful contrast against the deep greens of the rolling hills and cozy buildings of Pelican Town. The peaceful sound of the snow crunching beneath your feet can be the perfect accompaniment to a cozy winter evening.\n\n2. Outlast\n\nOutlast is a game all about fear, and the snow in this horror classic helps heighten that feeling of dread and isolation. The wintery landscapes add a chilling atmosphere to the game, as your character trudges through chest-high snowdrifts. All the while, the unknown menace lurks in the shadows, ready to pounce when you least expect it.\n\n3. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim\n\nThe snow in Skyrim is nothing short of breathtaking. Snow blankets the mountains and rivers, and creates an idyllic landscape that changes with the season. Whether you're exploring the treacherous peaks of the Rift or the lush valleys of the Reach, the snow makes it all the more stunning.\n\n4. Red Dead Redemption 2\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 takes the wild, lawless lands of the original game and adds an extra layer of realism with its astonishing weather effects. The snow in this game is stunning, piling high in the remote mountain areas and blanketing the windswept plains of New Hanover. You can practically feel the frigid chill of the wintery winds.\n\n5. The Last of Us Part II\n\nThe snow in The Last of Us Part II isn't just an eye-catching effect \u2013 it's also an integral part of the game's story. As you trudge through the freezing wilderness, the snow serves as an ever-present reminder of the bleakness of your situation. It's a grim reminder of the dark themes of the game.\n\n6. Horizon Zero Dawn\n\nSet in a post-apocalyptic future, Horizon Zero Dawn features a world filled with snow-covered forests, icy mountains, and desolate villages. The snow helps create a sense of despair and desolation, a harsh reminder of the dangers that lurk in the world.\n\n7. Dying Light\n\nIt doesn't always have to be deadly winter conditions \u2013 the snow can also be beautiful. Dying Light features a unique open world set in a zombie-infested city. Amidst the chaos and horror of the undead, you'll find snow-covered hills and frozen rivers that provide a fleeting moment of peace.\n\n8. Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain\n\nThe Metal Gear Solid series is no stranger to snow, and The Phantom Pain is no exception. Snowfalls transform the sandy deserts of Afghanistan into a wintry landscape, and the snow helps to create a feeling of tension and dread. It's a fitting setting for the dangerous mission at hand.\n\n9. Shadow of the Colossus\n\nThe awe-inspiring landscapes of Shadow of the Colossus are one of the things that make it such a beloved classic. As you climb the craggy peaks and deep ravines of the Forbidden Land, snow will often make an appearance, bringing with it a sense of peacefulness.\n\n10. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt\n\nThe snow-covered vistas of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt make it clear why the game is considered one of the best RPGs ever made. The snow in this game is used to great effect, creating a mix of stunning beauty and bittersweet loneliness. Whether you're hunting down monsters in the North or braving the frozen Skellige Isles, the snow is always a presence.\n\nSnow is a powerful tool for video game developers, as it can be used to convey a range of emotions. Whether it's used to create a peaceful atmosphere or to heighten the tension, snow helps to create an immersive experience for gamers. These are just a few of the most striking uses of snow in video games, but there are countless more out there. So, if you're looking for some wintery gaming inspiration, these titles should set you in the right direction.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "By the time those holiday tournaments across the state tip off, there has been ample time to smooth out the wrinkles and work out the kinks. Crowds fill the gyms, the stakes are raised, pressure moments crop up and the brand of basketball at Christmas time evolves into something different than in the weeks leading up to it.\n\nHere\u2019s a look back at the 91st Pontiac Holiday Tournament.\n\nBiggest story: Robert Smith says goodbye with a title\n\nThe relationship between Simeon and Pontiac has been well documented. So it was only fitting that coach Robert Smith, the key figure in keeping Simeon at Pontiac all these years, even through the Derrick Rose and Jabari Parker days, was given a warm and thankful sendoff from the Pontiac faithful.\n\nMore importantly for Smith, his Wolverines continue to impress and look like the No. 1 team in the state. Jalen Griffith remains a calming influence with the ball in his hands, while Miles and Wesley Rubin continue provide a presence at both ends of the floor, and Sam Lewis, the Oak Park transfer, is settling in nicely and becoming more and more impactful.\n\nSimeon took care of business and won yet another Pontiac title in Smith\u2019s final year on the bench.\n\nBiggest surprise: Pontiac advances to quarterfinals\n\nThis won\u2019t resonate much with the majority of Chicago area high school basketball fans, especially ones not connected to the Pontiac Holiday Tournament whatsoever. But Pontiac winning a game in its own tournament, particularly in a winner\u2019s bracket game, is a big deal. Plain and simple: it\u2019s extremely rare.\n\nPontiac knocked off West Aurora 60-55 on the opening night before getting throttled by both Simeon and New Trier. But that first-round win was a feel-good story for the fans of Pontiac and something those players will remember forever.\n\nThe win over West Aurora was the first time Pontiac advanced on in the championship bracket since 2006.\n\nSimeon\u2019s Robert Smith acknowledges the crowd after the Wolverines defeated Benet to win the Pontiac Holiday Tournament. Allen Cunningham/For the Sun-Times\n\nPlayer of the tournament: Benet\u2019s Brayden Fagbemi\n\nThere were bigger names and higher profile players in this tournament \u2013\u2013 even on his own Benet team \u2013\u2013 than Fagbemi. But there wasn\u2019t a player who grabbed the attention of fans or who meant more to his team\u2019s success than this steady, ready-for-the-moment point guard.\n\nWhile Fagbemi was featured as one of the City/Suburban Hoops Report\u2019s projected \u201cbreakout players\u201d in the preseason, no one knew the Johns Hopkins recruit. He was a little-used point guard off the bench a year ago. But he blossomed in the offseason and was brilliant in Pontiac.\n\nFagbemi went for 15 points, seven assists and seven rebounds in the opening win over Oak Park. He handled the relentless pressure and traps thrown his way against Bloom and Joliet West, turning the ball over just four times while playing all 32 minutes in each game. Along with teammate Niko Abusara, he spearheaded the comeback against Simeon before the Redwings fell in the title game.\n\nFagbemi was as poised as they come against relentless pressure, a true floor general. He handed out 20 assists while averaging 12 points and a four-to-one assist-to-turnover ratio.\n\nBest prospect: Joliet West\u2019s Jeremiah Fears\n\nFrom an evaluation standpoint, there just wasn\u2019t a better college prospect in the gym at Pontiac than the sophomore from Joliet West. He made sophomore mistakes. He still has to mature physically and learn how to pick his moments.\n\nBut Fears, the younger brother of star Jeremy Fears, Jr., the Michigan State recruit, has an easy, natural smoothness that screams next level. When you add in his shooting capabilities \u2013\u2013 Fears was 9 of 17 from beyond the arc \u2013\u2013 you have a young offensive force who you wonder just how high of a level he will go over the next two seasons.\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\u27a4 When Kaiden Space is healthy \u2013\u2013 the senior guard is currently out with an injury \u2013\u2013 there are four signed Division I prospects in Simeon\u2019s starting five. But the uncommitted starter, point guard Jalen Griffith, is proving to be the key cog in Robert Smith\u2019s No. 1 ranked team. Griffith, who was named the A.C. Williamson Award winner for his play, leadership and sportsmanship, was instrumental in delivering in key moments.\n\nGriffith led Simeon in scoring with 15 points a game while playing with remarkable efficiency. These numbers are eye-opening when you consider Griffith is a 5-9 point guard: 16 of 24 (67%) from inside the arc and 8 of 12 (67%) from beyond.\n\n\u27a4 They didn\u2019t reach the semifinals or finish in the top four. But the team that\u2019s better than I thought it would be after watching them play at Pontiac is Bloom. Coach Dante Maddox has so much rangy size and length to be disruptive with, and that starts with the backcourt of Raeshom Harris and Jordan Brown.\n\nBloom, which won three games and finished fifth at Pontiac, has lost to three teams this season ranked in the top 10 and who are a combined 46-4 on the season. And they lost to those three teams \u2013\u2013 Benet, Hillcrest and Brother Rice \u2013\u2013 by a combined 13 points.\n\n\u27a4 New Trier continues to be a resilient, physical team that\u2019s going to be an awfully tough out come state tournament time. That grit starts with senior Jake Feigen, a known shooter who averaged 22 points in four games at Pontiac.\n\n\u27a4 Will three straight wins and a consolation championship pump some life into an Oak Park team that came into Pontiac reeling?\n\nThe Huskies had lost four straight. But after falling to Benet for its fifth-straight loss in the first round, Oak Park went on to beat Plainfield North, Peoria Manual and West Aurora in succession to leave Pontiac on a positive note.\n\n\u27a4 The Pontiac Tournament, by all accounts, is the measuring stick for holiday tournaments across the state. This year\u2019s tournament didn\u2019t disappoint. But it had less depth than previous years.\n\nParting shot\n\nThe Robert Smith sendoff wasn\u2019t the only one at Pontiac. The tournament also said farewell to longtime tournament manager Jim Drengwitz, who has led this tournament for the past 23 years.\n\nAlthough always behind the scenes, Drengwitz has been an instrumental part of what has continued to make Pontiac a special place to be for three days each December. He\u2019s been such an omnipresent voice for such a long time at Pontiac that he will undoubtedly be missed. He\u2019s built relationships and organized in a way that has kept this the very best holiday tournament in the state.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Roku says it will begin building its own TVs\n\nRoku (ROKU) announced at CES 2023 in Las Vegas on Wednesday that it will begin selling TVs that it\u2019s designed and built on its own. The streaming giant currently offers Roku-branded TVs through third-party partners including TCL, Hisense, and Philips. The change means that Roku will control all aspects of the TV production process itself, rather than relying on those third parties.\n\nThe company will offer 11 models with sizes ranging from 24 inches to 75 inches and prices running from $119 to $999.\n\n\u201cOver the past 20 years, Roku has been instrumental in what is now the mainstream way to enjoy a great television series, a classic movie, or live sports,\u201d Roku\u2019s president of devices Mustafa Ozgen said in a statement.\n\nRoku announced that it's making it's own TVs at CES 2023. (Image: Roku)\n\n\u201cOur goal is to continue to create an even better TV experience for everyone. These Roku-branded TVs will not only complement the current lineup of partner-branded Roku TV models, but also allow us to enable future smart TV innovations. The streaming revolution has only just begun.\u201d\n\nAccording to Roku, the first-party TVs will go on sale in the U.S. this spring and, like third-party models, run on Roku\u2019s proprietary operating system. All sets will come with Roku voice remotes, Find My Remote, and Private Listening modes.\n\nIn addition to building its own TVs, Roku also announced its new OLED TV reference design for third-party Roku TV partners. The reference design is meant to bring OLED image quality, which provides more vibrant colors and deeper blacks, to a broader audience.\n\nRoku\u2019s deeper moves into the hardware space come as the company grapples with poor ad sales amid a downturn in the broader digital advertising market. While Roku sells hardware like its streaming devices and TVs, the vast majority of its revenue comes from its Platform business, which is made up of ad sales.\n\nIn Q3 2022, Roku\u2019s Platform business made up $670 million of its $761 million in total revenue. Its hardware sales brought in just $91 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut that reliance on advertising has hurt Roku in recent quarters. In Q2, the company missed Wall Street estimates on revenue and earnings per share, blaming the supply chain crunch and fears of falling advertising spending.\n\nAnd while the company met analysts\u2019 expectations in Q3, its Q4 guidance was well below expectations, a troubling sign considering Q4 should be its strongest quarter.\n\nThose problems have weighed on Roku\u2019s stock price throughout the last year, sending shares of the streaming giant plummeting more than 80% over the past 12 months.\n\nThe company will now have to ensure that its latest hardware investments pay off in either improved hardware revenue or better advertising sales by putting more sets in front of more consumers\u2019 eyes. Wall Street will just need to wait and see.\n\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Tech newsletter\n\nMore from Dan\n\nGot a tip? Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

{"text": "In the wake of my recent marital separation, I embarked on a personal journey of self-discovery and growth. The experience was undoubtedly challenging, but I remained resolute in my determination to emerge stronger and more resilient.\n\nAs I navigated this new chapter in my life, I found solace in the natural world. My backyard garden became a sanctuary, where I could connect with the rhythms of nature and the creatures that inhabited it. Among these, the squirrels in particular captured my attention.\n\nTheir daily antics and interactions fascinated me, and I found myself observing them with increasing frequency. One morning, I witnessed a remarkable display of conflict resolution, as two squirrels engaged in a heated dispute over a nut. To my surprise, one of the squirrels ultimately backed down, offering the nut to its opponent in a gesture of peace and understanding.\n\nThis encounter struck a chord with me, resonating with the lessons I was learning about myself during this period. I realized that, just as the squirrels were capable of forgiveness and reconciliation, I too could choose to let go of grudges and move forward.\n\nAs time passed, my appreciation for the squirrels grew, and I found myself reflecting on the parallels between their behavior and my own. I noticed that, just as they would often make mistakes or missteps, I too would struggle with self-criticism and regret. However, I also observed that the squirrels were able to quickly move on, without dwelling on past conflicts.\n\nThe squirrels in my backyard have become a symbol of hope and renewal for me, reminding me that even in the darkest moments, joy and beauty can still be found. They have taught me the importance of compassion, forgiveness, and moving forward, and I am grateful for the lessons they have imparted.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "A renowned entertainer has recently shared an unconventional yet potentially effective strategy for navigating the current economic climate. The Grammy-winning artist, known for her outspoken nature, took to Instagram Live to discuss her approach to managing finances amidst rising inflation.\n\nAccording to the artist, her solution is to diversify her bank accounts. She emphasized the importance of doing so, stating that if one bank were to experience financial difficulties, having funds in other institutions would prevent the loss of all one's money. While not a certified financial advisor, the artist's words have resonated with many, who see the logic in her advice.\n\nThis is not the first time a celebrity has ventured into the realm of financial advice. Recent examples include a well-known actor and a professional basketball player, who have also shared their thoughts on managing one's finances. The artist's message, however, is particularly timely, as many individuals are feeling the pinch of inflation.\n\nIn an effort to alleviate the rising cost of living, the President has proposed a comprehensive economic stimulus plan. If approved, this plan aims to inject more funds into the economy, thus reducing the effects of inflation. In the interim, the artist's advice on diversifying one's bank accounts may prove to be a valuable strategy.\n\nIt is likely that other celebrities will continue to offer their insights on personal finance as the economic situation evolves. The artist's unique advantage lies in her significant social media following, which allows her to reach a broad audience and potentially make a meaningful impact on people's financial decisions. While unconventional, the artist's advice may be precisely what people need to safeguard their financial well-being.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Rest is often cast as the antithesis of success. In a culture that often glorifies \"the grind,\" clocking insanely long hours, eating lunch at our desks and having no time to do anything outside of our jobs have become badges of honor. The message that success belongs to go-getters who work themselves into exhaustion in pursuit of their dreams is preached everywhere from viral Instagram posts claiming \"sleep is for the weak\" to business executives who brag about working 100-hour weeks. But it turns out that slowing down, doing less and setting aside time to rest can actually help you be more successful \u2014 and productive \u2014 at work in the long run.\n\nThe hidden benefits of resting at work\n\nSpending more time resting during the workday doesn't just stave off burnout \u2014 past research shows it can stimulate creativity, help you concentrate better and make the time you spend on meetings and tasks more efficient. \"Rest is an essential component of working well and working smart,\" Alex Soojung-Kim Pang, author of the book \"Rest: Why You Get More Done When You Work Less,\" once explained in an op-ed for Greater Good Magazine. What's more, \"rest is productive,\" LaShawn Davis, a human resources consultant, tells CNBC Make It. \"Productivity isn't just about getting results, it's about getting the best results you can, and it's impossible to perform your best if you're not well-rested.\" People who prioritize rest, Davis adds, show up to work more energized, focused and prepared to tackle any challenges that arise. That's because even when our brain is resting, it's still active, engaging its \"default network\" to problem-solve, think creatively and seek out new information, Pang explained. \"We may not be able to control these processes completely,\" he added. \"But by learning to rest better, we can support them [and] let them work.\"\n\nHow to incorporate rest into your schedule", "label": "human"}
{"text": "From the outside looking in, it seems VinFast succeeded in hitting its target delivery date at the price of failing the customer. The young EV automaker said repeatedly this year that it planned to deliver the first examples of the VF 8 battery-electric SUV to reservation holders before 2022 ended. The Silver Queen cargo ship left Vietnam in late November, disgorging 999 VF 8's at the port of Benicia, north of San Francisco, in December. Then came the ol' switcheroo. Every unit on the cargo ship was a previously unheard of \"limited release\" variant called the City Edition set aside \"for VinFirst Pioneer customers only,\" the first among the reservation holders. In a letter to expectant shoppers, VinFast said the City Edition's \"early release [was] to meet the demand of VinFast vehicle lovers\" and offers a range of \"approximately\" 180 miles instead of the 260-mile range promised in April this year.\n\nThe City Edition's smaller range comes courtesy of a smaller 82-kWh battery instead of the 87.7-kWh battery in the series production VF 8. The bad news continues with VinFast's retail site claiming 179 EPA-estimated miles, not 180. The company says an OTA update in January will improve range, but didn't say by how much.\n\nThe automaker's also delayed its battery subscription program that was going to cost $169 per month for the VF 8 and give customers unlimited miles. The relevant page on the retail site now says, \"At this time all vehicles are sold or leased inclusive of battery,\" and the vehicle warranty lasts for 10 years or 125,000 miles. With the subscription once touted as a way to save money on leasing or ownership, its end could help explain why prices have gone up on the series production models. In April, VinFast expected to sell a VF 8 Eco with a 260-mile range for $41,200 after the $1,200 destination fee, a VF 8 Plus with a 277-mile range costing $49,200. Now, the City Edition Eco starts at $56,700, the City Edition Plus starts at $63,700, the base VF 8 Eco starts at $60,200.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor comparison, a 2023 Ford Mustang Mach-E Premium with e-AWD and the standard battery with 224 miles of range starts at $58,975, if you could find one.\n\nVinFast offered the VinFirst Pioneers a $6,000 total discount for switching to the City Edition, but it's possible the number of aggrieved reservation holders compelled a change of strategy. Instead of the letter's assertion that the model was only for early adopters, VinFast's retail website now shows a pop up offering a 24-month lease deal to California residents who want the City Edition. With $5,774 due at signing, the City Edition Eco will cost $599 per month and offer 10,000 miles per year. A 36-month lease offer asks $6,869 down and $574 per month. The City Edition Plus needs $6,789 due at signing, then costs $699 per month for 10,000 miles per year for 24 months.\n\nBack to ranges, there could be more questions on the way for the series models. On VinFast's U.S. site, the reservation page containing specs for the VF 8 and VF 9 also include asterisks next to their range figures of \"up to 292 miles\" and \"up to 342 miles,\" respectively. On that page, the explanation given for both is, \"Value valid for VF 8 Eco Enhanced Range trim level (battery variant 2). Preliminary values, determined according to the principles of the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP) Standard.\" All of which means the various numbers VinFast is using here might not end up being the numbers the EPA uses.\n\nIt's early days for the company here, and news cycles turn quickly. Nevertheless, we think VinFast's local reps are going to be busy for a while getting everything headed in the desired direction again.", "label": "human"}

The DOJ claimed that a merger of the industry-dominating publishers could \"lessen competition\" in the market.\n\nSoon after the judge's decision, Paramount Global , which owns Simon & Schuster, officially pulled the plug on the deal. Paramount noted that it would explore options to sell Simon & Schuster elsewhere.\n\nPenguin disagreed with the DOJ's ruling and had planned to appeal until Paramount subsequently backed out of the deal.\n\n\"We regret Markus Dohle's decision to leave Bertelsmann and Penguin Random House,\" said Christoph Mohn, chairman of Penguin parent Bertelsmann's supervisory board. \"He has sustainably focused Penguin Random House on growth and profitability.

Read our review Read Our Review A looong arrow, pointing right\n\nIf you want as many premium travel perks as possible, The Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express could be the right card for you. The $695 annual fee is high, but you get a long list of benefits such as airport lounge access, travel statement credits, complimentary hotel elite status, and more.\n\nReview: Is the Amex Platinum the best card for you?\n\nIf you want a premium rewards card \u2014 one that offers benefits like airport lounge access and annual statement credits for travel \u2014 the The Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express should absolutely be on your shortlist. It has a $695 annual fee, but you get some great perks in return, including access to fancy Centurion lounges at airports around the world.\n\nWhile most of its benefits are related to travel \u2014 such as complimentary elite status with Hilton and Marriott** and up to $200 in annual airline fee credits** \u2014 the Platinum Card has added new perks like digital subscription credits** and Equinox membership credits** to help offset the annual fee. If you don't travel much to begin with, though, this probably isn't the card for you. But if you want as many premium perks as possible and don't get an invite for the exclusive Amex Black card, this is the next best thing.\n\nThe Platinum Card earns American Express Membership Rewards points that you can transfer to more than a dozen airline and hotel partners. It also offers a huge welcome bonus offer of 80,000 Membership Rewards\u00ae points after spending $6,000 on purchases in the first six months of card membership that can jumpstart your award travel.\n\nBased on Insider's valuation of Amex points at 1.8 cents apiece, Platinum Card members can expect to get up to $1,440 in value from the current welcome bonus offer.\n\nThe main competitor of the Platinum Card is the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae, which has a $550 annual fee. The Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae could be a better pick if you want high-value options for using your points that don't involve travel, since Chase's Pay Yourself Back program lets you redeem for eligible purchases with a 50% bonus in point value with the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae.\n\nThere's also the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card, which includes upscale benefits for a relatively low annual fee of $395. It comes with a welcome bonus offer of 75,000 bonus miles when you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening. It also offers Priority Pass***, Plaza Premium***, and Capital One lounge access*** and up to $300 in annual credit toward purchases made through Capital One travel***.\n\nBut if you travel frequently and want as many hotel and airport lounge perks as possible, the Platinum Card is hard to beat.\n\nInsider's Featured Rewards Credit Cards Wells Fargo Autograph\u2120 Card\n\nCiti Premier\u00ae Card\n\nChase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options.

These cards won't be worth it if you're paying interest or late fees. When using a credit card, it's important to pay your balance in full each month, make payments on time, and only spend what you can afford to pay.\n\nHow to earn points with the Amex Platinum card\n\nThe Platinum Card doesn't have a terribly complicated earning structure. Cardholders earn:\n\n5 points per dollar on airfare purchased directly through the airline or through Amex Travel (on up to $500,000 per calendar year)\n\n5 points per dollar on hotels booked through Amex Travel\n\n1 point per dollar on all other eligible purchases\n\nHow to use Amex Membership Rewards points\n\nThe Platinum Card earns Membership Rewards points, the currency of Amex's loyalty program. You can exchange them for statement credits or cash back, use them to book travel through Amex's travel website, or transfer them to any of 17 airline and three hotel transfer partners (transferable points like these are among the most valuable).\n\nMembership Rewards points don't have a fixed value, so it's a bit tricky to figure out how much they're worth. To get an idea, Insider's rewards experts developed a set of points and miles valuations, which approximates the value of each Amex point at 1.8 cents on average, though it's possible to get a lesser or much greater value depending on how you use them.\n\nThe Platinum Card comes with a welcome offer of 80,000 Membership Rewards\u00ae points after spending $6,000 on purchases in the first six months of card membership. Based on our valuations, 80,000 points are worth about $1,440, which alone makes up for more than two years of the annual fee.\n\nIf you transfer points to airline frequent-flyer programs and use them to fly round-trip to Europe \u2014 or even one-way in first class \u2014 you could end up getting a much higher value.\n\nIf you're staying close to home, you can still use Amex Membership Rewards points for lots of non-travel redemptions, including:\n\nBenefits and features\n\nEven among premium cards, the Platinum Card stands out for offering the longest list of benefits you'll find. This includes both a healthy selection of travel credits and perks like lounge access, as well as statement credits for Saks purchases and access to the Amex concierge service.\n\nAirport lounge access\n\nThe Platinum Card offers access to various airport lounges, not just the Priority Pass lounges** you can access with the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae, Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card, and the Hilton Honors American Express Aspire Card (though you can access these, too).\n\nThis includes:\n\nAmex's proprietary Centurion lounges, located at more than 10 airports in the US and with one location in Hong Kong. These lounges offer comfortable seating, complimentary cocktails, and food created by award-winning chefs. Access to these lounges is limited to holders of Platinum Card or Amex Centurion cards.\n\nIf you're flying with Delta and carry a Platinum Card, you can also access any Delta Sky Club lounge. With more than 30 locations, Sky Clubs offer snacks, complimentary soft and alcoholic drinks (with more \"premium\" drinks available for purchase), fast WiFi, and a place to unwind. Some also feature showers.\n\nInternational American Express lounges (with locations in countries like Argentina, Australia, and Mexico)\n\nEscape Lounges, with locations in the US and UK\n\nFinally, the Platinum Card comes with a membership to Priority Pass, a network of more than 1,300 airport lounges around the world. With that membership, you and two guests can access any lounge location (as long as there's room) to enjoy free snacks, drinks, newspapers and magazines, showers, and more.\n\nUp to $200 annual airline fee credit\n\nEvery calendar year, the Platinum Card offers up to a $200 credit toward incidental fees** on one airline of your choice.\n\nIt doesn't cover tickets but applies to a wide variety of things such as checked bags, flight-change fees, inflight food and drinks, fees for traveling with a pet, airport-lounge day passes (if you don't already have complimentary access), and sometimes even things like seat assignments and extra-legroom upgrade fees at one airline.\n\nUp to $200 in Uber Cash each year\n\nThe Platinum Card offers up to $200 in Uber Cash credits** each year. The credit is broken into chunks \u2014 each month, you'll get a $15 credit added to your linked Uber account, with an extra $20 for a total of $35 each December.\n\nIf you travel regularly or live close to a city, this is an easy perk to get value from. You can also put the credits toward UberEats orders for food or even groceries and household supplies.\n\nIn addition, your account will be upgraded to Uber VIP status. There aren't a ton of perks with this, and it's available only in some cities, but you'll only be connected to drivers with at least a 4.8-star rating.\n\nUp to $100 in Saks credit each year\n\nThe Platinum Card offers up to $50 in statement credits when you use the card to make a Saks purchase from January to June, and up to $50 again from July through December each year**.\n\nElite status with Hilton Honors and Marriott Bonvoy\n\nThe Platinum Card comes with Gold-level elite status at both Marriott and Hilton loyalty programs**.\n\nIf you stay at hotels even a few nights a year, these benefits can be extremely valuable \u2014 Hilton offers Gold elites free breakfast for two each morning (currently awarded as a food and beverage credit in the US).\n\nUp to $100 to cover the application fee for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck\n\nTSA PreCheck and Global Entry are absolute musts for just about any traveler. Once you enroll, you can use special lanes to breeze through airport security \u2014 you won't have to remove shoes and light coats, and you can leave your laptop in your bag. With Global Entry, you can use a fast lane when you return to the US from abroad, which makes clearing immigration and customs easy and quick.\n\nThe programs cost $78 to $100, and American Express will provide a credit for that fee every four years (memberships are valid for five years).\n\nUp to $200 hotel credit\n\nCardholders will get up to $200 in credit each calendar year toward prepaid bookings at Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts or Hotel Collection properties (with a minimum of two-night stay) when they book with their card through Amex Travel. This credit expires at the end of every year and doesn't roll over, but you're only required to book by December 31 to receive the credit\u2014 your travel dates can be later.\n\nFine Hotels and Resorts bookings include perks such as free breakfast, guaranteed late checkout, room upgrades and early check-in when available, and a welcome amenity or credit unique to each property. If you would have otherwise paid cash for a luxury hotel stay, this perk can effectively shave $200 off your annual fee cost.\n\nBookings with The Hotel Collection must be for a minimum of two nights, and include benefits like room upgrades and a $100 on-property credit.\n\n$189 CLEAR\u00ae credit\n\nCLEAR\u00ae is an expedited security screening program that can save you time waiting in long lines at select US airports and stadiums. A CLEAR\u00ae membership normally costs $189 per year ($119 for members of the United or Delta frequent flyer programs, and further discounts are available for elite status members), but if you pay with your Platinum Card, you'll receive a credit to offset the CLEAR\u00ae application fee**.\n\nWhen you have a CLEAR\u00ae membership, you can jump to the front of the security line, but \u2014 unlike TSA PreCheck members \u2014you'll still have to remove items like your laptop and shoes before getting screened. CLEAR\u00ae isn't a government program so the application requirements are much less stringent than those of TSA PreCheck and Global Entry.\n\nThe downside is that CLEAR\u00ae screening is only in select locations, so if the airports you travel through don't participate, this benefit is of little use to you. However, the program is also available at a handful of stadiums, so if you're a sports fan who likes to attend live games, this could end up being a good deal.\n\nUp to $240 digital entertainment credit\n\nAccording to Amex, 78% of Platinum Card cardholders took advantage of limited-time statement credits for streaming services that were offered during the height of the pandemic in 2020. These new digital entertainment credits are permanent, and are awarded in chunks of up to $20 per month (maximum $240 per year). Enrollment is required before you can use this perk.\n\nEligible digital subscription services for the credit include:\n\nAudible \u2014 Plans start at $7.95 per month (after free trial)\n\nThe New York Times \u2014 $17 every four weeks for a standard subscription (after any introductory offers)\n\nSiriusXM \u2014 Plans start at $10.99 per month (after any introductory offers)\n\nPeacock \u2014 Plans start at $4.99 per month\n\nDisney+ \u2014 Plans start at $7.99 per month\n\nThe Disney Bundle \u2014 Plans start at $13.99 per month\n\nESPN+ \u2014 Plans start at $6.99 per month\n\nHulu \u2014 Plans start at $6.99 per month\n\nDepending on if these are subscriptions you already have (or would be likely to use), this credit might not make a difference for you.\n\nUp to $300 Equinox credit\n\nCardholders can receive up to $300 annually (up to $25 per month) in credits toward Equinox gym memberships or digital subscriptions to on-demand fitness classes through the Equinox+ app**. Enrollment is also required to activate this benefit.\n\nEquinox is a chain of high-end fitness clubs that are mostly located in large US cities. The company's website lists 106 locations, 40 of which are in Manhattan, and the rest are sprinkled around places like Chicago, Miami, London, and Washington, DC.\n\nAmex recently made the Equinox credit more useful by making it usable toward any membership (previously was restricted to Equinox All Access, Destination, E by Equinox, or Equinox+). In addition, starting in 2023, you can use all $300 of the credit at once \u2014 it will no longer be doled out in $25-per-month increments.\n\nAgain, if this is something you'd pay for anyway, these credits could amount to a nice little discount \u2014 but keep in mind that Equinox memberships are not cheap. For example, with a 12-month commitment, you'd pay $240 per month for membership at the Rockefeller Center location, and $275 per month if you want access to all US clubs.\n\nWalmart+ membership credit\n\nWhen you use your Platinum Card to pay for Walmart's subscription service, Walmart+, you'll receive a statement credit for the cost** ($12.95 plus applicable sales tax each month).\n\nOnly Walmart+ monthly memberships (not annual) qualify for this perk. A Walmart+ membership gets you free delivery, free shipping with no minimums, pharmacy discounts, and other perks \u2014 so if you're already a Walmart shopper it's a no-brainer to use this benefit.\n\n$300 SoulCycle at-home bike credit\n\nIf you're in the market for a SoulCycle at-home bike, use your Platinum Card to make the purchase through your Equinox+ account online and you'll receive a $300 statement credit. These bikes cost about $2,500, so this isn't a massive discount \u2014 but if you're making this purchase anyway, it's a nice deal.\n\nYou can actually redeem this credit for up to 15 separate bike purchases each year, but keep in mind each purchase requires a 12-month Equinox+ membership ($40 per month plus applicable tax) to qualify, and purchases made in-store or through the Equinox mobile app aren't eligible for the credit.\n\nAmex Fine Hotels & Resorts\n\nAmex Platinum cardmembers can access the Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts program. When you book participating hotels through Amex Travel, you'll enjoy perks including room upgrades, free breakfast, late checkout, free Wi-Fi, and a unique amenity at each hotel, like a credit to use at on-property spas or restaurants.\n\nAmex Platinum concierge\n\nPlatinum Card holders also get exclusive concierge service. The concierge service can be helpful for things like getting tickets to shows or helping you plan a trip itinerary. While the services are complimentary, you're responsible for paying for any services booked or purchases made on your behalf\n\nCell phone protection\n\nAmex has added cell phone protection to a number of premium cards, including the Platinum Card.\n\nWhen you use the card to pay your wireless bill, you're covered for the cost of repair or replacement if your phone is damaged or stolen, up to $800 per claim and up to two claims per 12-month period. There's a $50 deductible, and you must file your claim within 90 days of the incident.\n\nCar rental insurance\n\nThe Platinum Card offers secondary car rental insurance when you use the card to pay for your rental in full and decline the rental company's collision damage waiver. Coverage is for theft or damage only (not liability) and some rentals, vehicle types, and countries are excluded, so be sure to read the terms.\n\nTrip cancellation and interruption insurance\n\nSome Amex cards now include trip cancellation and interruption benefits. If you paid for a covered trip with the Platinum Card and it's canceled or cut short for a covered reason, you could be reimbursed up to $10,000 per trip and up to $20,000 per card per consecutive 12-month period.\n\nBaggage insurance\n\nWhen you pay for a covered trip with your Platinum Card, you can be covered for baggage loss or damage, up to $2,000 per person for checked bags and $3,000 per person for carry-on luggage.\n\nThere are exclusions for high-risk items and some states have different limits, so check the terms and conditions for specific details.\n\nTrip delay insurance\n\nYou can get reimbursed up to $500 for meals, lodging, toiletries, medication, and other personal items if you've paid for a covered trip with your Platinum Card and it's delayed by six hours or more, up to two times per consecutive 12-month period.\n\nReturn protection\n\nIf you purchased an eligible item with the Platinum Card and the merchant won't accept your return, you're may get a refund of the full purchase price (excluding shipping and handling), up to $300 per item and a maximum of $1,000 per calendar year.\n\nPurchase protection\n\nWhen you pay for an eligible item with the Platinum Card, you can be covered for loss or damage up to 90 days from the date of purchase, up to a maximum of $10,000 per occurrence and $50,000 per year.\n\nExtended warranty\n\nCardholders can also get an extended warranty on eligible items when they use their Platinum Card to pay \u2014 up to one additional year added to eligible US manufacturer's warranties of five years or less.\n\nPremium Global Assist Hotline\n\nThe Platinum Card comes with an underrated perk that can be a lifesaver if you have an emergency while you're away from home. Cardholders get access to Amex's Premium Global Assist Hotline, which can help arrange things like passport replacement, medical referrals, and translation services.\n\nThe service itself is complimentary, but you may be responsible for any third-party costs. One big difference from the regular (versus premium) Global Assist Hotline is emergency medical evacuation coverage \u2014 Amex may provide emergency medical transportation assistance at no cost if it's approved and coordinated by Premium Global Assist Hotline.\n\nAmex Offers\n\nLike other American Express cards, the Platinum Card includes targeted discounts and bonus rewards at participating merchants through Amex Offers**.\n\nThe Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express 4.75 /5 A five pointed star A five pointed star A five pointed star A five pointed star A five pointed star 4.75 out of 5 Stars Intro offer 80,000 Membership Rewards\u00ae points after spending $6,000 on purchases in the first six months of card membership Rewards Earn 5x Membership Rewards\u00ae Points for flights booked directly with airlines or with American Express Travel on up to $500,000 per calendar year.

Read our review Read Our Review A looong arrow, pointing right\n\nFees and costs\n\nAs discussed above, the Platinum Card has a $695 annual fee. This isn't waived for the first year, so you'll start paying it as soon as you're approved for the card. However, if you're an active-duty servicemember, you could be able to get the Amex Platinum without the annual fee.\n\nThe card doesn't charge foreign transaction fees but it does have the Pay Over Time financing option (rather than paying your statement balance in full each month), See Pay Over Time APR to see your rates. Additionally, there's a late payment fee and a returned payment fee of up to $40.\n\nIf you're considering this card, make sure you're able to pay your statement balance in full each month \u2014 both because the interest fees will rack up quickly if you don't, and there are better cards to consider if you need to carry a balance from month to month.\n\nComparison: Amex Platinum vs other American Express cards\n\nThe Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express American Express\u00ae Gold Card American Express\u00ae Green Card Annual fee $695 $250 $150 Rewards rate 5x points on airfare purchased directly through the airline, and on flights and hotels booked through Amex Travel*** 1 point per dollar on everything else 4x points at restaurants, and at U.S. supermarkets* 3x points on flights booked directly through the airline or Amex Travel 1 point per dollar on everything else 3x points on travel, transit, and restaurants 1 point per dollar on all other purchases Welcome bonus offer 80,000 Membership Rewards\u00ae points after spending $6,000 on purchases in the first six months of card membership 60,000 points after you spend at least $4,000 in your first 6 months of card membership 40,000 points after you spend $2,000 on purchases in the first six months of account opening Statement credits Up to $200 in airline fee credits each calendar year Up to $100 in Saks credits each calendar year** Global Entry or TSA PreCheck application fee credit Up to $300 annually (up to $25 per month) on the Equinox+ app or eligible Equinox club memberships** $189 per year in credits for CLEAR\u00ae membership** Up to $200 in credits per year toward prepaid hotel bookings through Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts or The Hotel Collection (with a two-night minimum) Up to $240 in annual credits (up to $20 per month) toward eligible digital subscriptions***** $12.95 in credits each month toward Walmart+ membership** $300 statement credit toward a purchase of SoulCycle At-Home Bike online Up to $120 in dining credits each calendar year** Up to $189 in CLEAR\u00ae credit per year** Up to $100 in LoungeBuddy credit per year** Other benefits Up to $200 in Uber Cash each calendar year** Gold elite status with Hilton and Marriott (enrollment required) Airport lounge access (Priority Pass**, Centurion lounges, and more) Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts (benefits at exclusive luxury properties) The Hotel Collection (property credits and upgrades) Cell phone protection Secondary car rental insurance Trip cancellation insurance Baggage insurance Trip delay insurance Return protection Purchase protection Extended warranty Premium Global Assist Hotline Discounts and bonuses through Amex Offers** No foreign transaction fees Up to $120 in Uber Cash each calendar year**** The Hotel Collection (property credits and upgrades) Secondary car rental insurance Baggage insurance Trip delay insurance Purchase protection Extended warranty Global Assist Hotline Discounts and bonuses through Amex Offers** No foreign transaction fees Secondary car rental insurance Trip delay insurance Baggage insurance Purchase protection Extended warranty Global Assist Hotline Discounts and bonuses through Amex Offers** No foreign transaction fees Review Amex Gold card review Amex Green card review\n\n*on up to $25,000 spent at U.S. supermarkets per calendar year, then 1x\n\n**up to $10 in statement credits per month when you use the Amex Gold card at Grubhub, Seamless, The Cheesecake Factory, Milk Bar, Wine.com, Goldbelly, and participating Shake Shack locations.

Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. If you can use the Platinum Card's generous range of benefits, you can get a value that far exceeds the card's $695 annual fee. Even if you don't maximize every benefit, it's fairly easy to at least offset the annual fee between up to $200 in airline fee credits, up to $200 in Uber Cash, up to $100 in Saks credits, and up to $240 in digital entertainment credits each year.\n\nIs the Amex Platinum hard to get approved for? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Because it's a premium rewards card, the Platinum Card is harder to get approved for than some other popular cards. Amex will look at your credit score, income, and other factors when it considers your application. Keep in mind you won't be eligible for the welcome offer if you already have, or have had, the Platinum Card because of Amex's once-per-lifetime rule. However, if you have/had another version of the Platinum, such as The Business Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express , you're still eligible for the bonus.\n\nCan you carry a balance on the Amex Platinum? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. The Platinum Card requires you to pay your balance off in full each month, unless you're enrolled in Amex's Pay Over Time feature. This extended-financing option allows cardholders to pay off qualifying charges over $100 over a longer time period, with interest.\n\nCan you add authorized users to the Amex Platinum card? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. If you want your authorized users to receive select card benefits, including airport lounge access, a TSA PreCheck or Global Entry credit, and hotel/rental car elite status, you can add up to three Platinum authorized users at a cost of $175 total. Any additional authorized users after that cost $175 each. However, if you don't need these benefits for your additional cardholders, you can add up to 99 Gold authorized users at no cost. Authorized user Gold cards are not the same as the standalone Amex Gold Card; in addition, these cardholders will not receive airport lounge access or elite status, but they are eligible for their own TSA PreCheck or Global Entry application fee credit.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nJust seconds after Buffalo Bills player Damar Hamlin collapsed on the field from cardiac arrest on Monday, medical personnel swarmed onto the field in an immediate response that has been widely credited for the player\u2019s steps toward recovery.\n\nBut one Bills team member in particular \u2013 assistant athletic trainer Denny Kellington \u2013 has been praised by head coach Sean McDermott for \u201csaving Damar\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nBills offensive lineman Dion Dawkins said in a tweet Thursday that it was Kellington who administered critical CPR to Hamlin, who doctors say lost his pulse on the field had to be immediately revived through resuscitation and defibrillation.\n\n\u201cFor an assistant to find himself at that position and needing to take the action that he did and step up and take charge like he did \u2013 and there were others on the field as well \u2013 is nothing short of amazing,\u201d McDermott said of Kellington during a news conference Thursday.\n\n\u201cAnd the courage that took - you talk about a real leader, a real hero in saving Damar\u2019s life and just admire his strength.\u201d\n\nHamlin was transported to the hospital, where he was sedated. On Thursday, his doctors announced Hamlin had started to awaken. Though he remains critically ill and on a ventilator, his medical team said the player is showing signs of \u201cgood neurologic recovery\u201d and is making significant improvement.\n\nThe immediate response of Kellington and other medical personnel was vital to \u201cnot just saving his life, but his neurological function,\u201d Dr. Timothy Pritts, one of Hamlin\u2019s doctors at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, said Thursday.\n\nIn cardiac arrest, the heart is no longer pumping blood, which means no oxygen is traveling to the brain or other organs. Seconds matter: The longer a person goes without oxygen, the chances of organ damage increase, and the chances of survival decrease. CPR mimics a pumping heart, which keeps blood flowing, and a defibrillator shocks the heart, which can cause it to start beating again.\n\nKellington has been a member of the Bills\u2019 training staff since 2017. Prior to joining the team, he was an athletic trainer at Syracuse University for 11 years, six of which were spent as the head athletic trainer for the football team, according to the university and Kellington\u2019s LinkedIn. He also previously served as a graduate student athletic trainer at Ohio State University, the school confirmed to CNN.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback If you don't know how to perform CPR, watch this 03:36 - Source: CNN\n\n\u2018We\u2019re going to need everybody\u2019\n\nIn audio obtained by CNN of medical personnel who responded from the sidelines, medical teams can be heard urgently requesting everyone to respond the minute Hamlin collapsed at 8:55 p.m. ET.\n\nAt 8:55 p.m. ET, when Hamlin hit the ground, someone can be heard saying, \u201cGo over to the cot. I don\u2019t like how he went down.\u201d\n\nA few seconds later, another voice says, \u201cWe\u2019re going to need everybody. All call, all call.\u201d Within the minute, several other cries go out for all personnel to rush to the field.\n\nBetween 9:12 and 9:20 p.m., personnel can be heard requesting another medic and emergency equipment for the ambulance.\n\nThe rapid response of medical teams that night has been repeatedly praised by NFL officials, Bills team members and physicians.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly not an exaggeration to say that the skilled and the immediate response by all of these talented caregivers prevented a very tragic outcome at that moment,\u201d NFL chief medical officer Dr. Allen Sills said Wednesday.\n\nSills said that the league holds drills before the season to prepare for medical emergencies and also holds briefing meetings among medical teams before every game.\n\nMcDermott also opened the Bills\u2019 news conference Thursday with a word of thanks for \u201cthe first responders on the field this past Monday evening and the medical teams of the Bills, the Bengals and the staff, doctors and nurses at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center for their work and their care.\u201d", "label": "human"}

{"text": "As a significant commemorative occasion approaches, the President of the United States delivered a speech on Monday, commending a newly enacted law that aims to alleviate the suffering of individuals who were exposed to hazardous substances during their military service.\n\nThe legislation, named after the late Senator John McCain, provides complimentary medical care for veterans who have developed health issues linked to their exposure to toxic substances, including those released by burn pits. The law also facilitates the process of proving exposure, thereby enabling eligible veterans to access medical care and other benefits.\n\nThe President emphasized the tangible benefits of this legislation, stating that it will provide the necessary care and support to veterans and their families, who have earned and rightfully deserve it. The law has the potential to positively impact thousands of veterans who believe their health issues are directly related to their exposure to burn pits during their deployments in the Middle East and other regions.\n\nMany veterans have reported experiencing a range of symptoms, including respiratory problems, cancer, and other debilitating illnesses, which they attribute to their exposure to smoke containing toxic chemicals, carcinogens, asbestos, and burning human remains. Despite the military's claims that burn pits did not cause health issues, and the Environmental Protection Agency's assertion that there is no consistent pattern of elevated health risks, veterans have long maintained that their exposure was neglected and that the passage of this law is a crucial step towards acknowledging the harm caused and providing them with the necessary assistance.\n\nThe President highlighted the importance of honoring the sacrifices made by veterans and expressed his commitment to ensuring that their needs are addressed and recognized. The law is a testament to the legacy of Senator John McCain, who fought tirelessly for its passage before his passing, and his daughter, Meghan McCain, described it as a powerful tribute to her father's memory.\n\nThe law also authorizes the creation of a registry to track veterans' exposure to burn pits and other toxic substances, as well as to collect data on the health of veterans who have been exposed. This registry will provide resources and information on health issues potentially linked to exposure, and the President noted that it will help the nation better understand the full scope of burn pit health effects, enabling more effective treatment and prevention strategies for those affected and their families.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The Russian forces most often launch Iranian-made kamikaze drones at night along the Dnipro riverbed, because this way, it is harder to detect the UAVs with radar.\n\nSource: Yurii Ihnat, spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force, on the air of Ukrainian Radio\n\nDetails: When asked why the air defence does not shoot down UAVs moving along the Dnipro River, the Air Force spokesman noted:\n\nQuote: \"Because they become less visible on radar the closer they press to the ground. If you want to live, you have to get lower. The radar antenna that detects the target will not see it if the target is flying below the level of the antenna.\"\n\nDetails: When asked whether citizens can help the military, Ihnat explained that the ePPO [a smartphone application that can be used to notify Ukrainian air defence forces about Russian missiles and drones \u2013 ed.] systems are unlikely to provide any information at the time of the attack.\n\nMost often drones fly at night, and Ukrainians can detect them only by sound. However, it is not that simple. While there is a warning system or calls to the police, time will pass and the drone will already be in another place (its speed is 150 km/h).\n\nThe most important thing for citizens is to take care of themselves and stay in shelters, the colonel explains.\n\nQuote: \"Because even with 100% air defence, unfortunately, fragments fall and can destroy cars, buildings and [take \u2013 ed.] people's lives. When the missile hits the target, it does not explode immediately head-on with a Shahed, but next to it.\n\nThis is how anti-aircraft weapons work. Their hitting elements pierce the fuselage of a missile or drone, the missile loses its aerodynamic features and falls down. Its warhead does not necessarily explode upon impact with an anti-aircraft missile. Meaning, this warhead and the fragments of the anti-aircraft missile fall to the ground.\"\n\nBackground: With incredible efforts, the Ukrainian air defence system shot down 84 Russian drones at night of the two days of the New Year celebration, demonstrating 100% results.\n\nAt the same time, the Air Force emphasises that Ukraine will need more air defence systems to effectively counter these weapons with such an intensity of the invaders.\n\nJournalists fight on their own frontline.

{"text": "The curtain has closed on a remarkable chapter in aviation history as the final 747 Jumbo Jet has departed the Boeing factory in Everett, Wash., after a production run spanning over five decades.\n\nThe last 747, registered as LN-25 and designated for freighter operations, has been handed over to a Singapore-based aircraft leasing and trading company. This marks the end of an era, as the iconic plane takes its final bow and is consigned to the annals of aviation heritage.\n\nThe original \"Queen of the Skies\" made its maiden flight in 1969 and has since carried millions of passengers worldwide, revolutionizing air travel in the process. Its large size enabled the introduction of wide-body cabins, offering passengers unprecedented legroom and comfort. The double-decker design also paved the way for affordable long-haul flights, making distant destinations more accessible to the masses.\n\nAt its peak, Boeing produced over 1,500 747s, which became a symbol of luxury and wealth, often used by celebrities and world leaders, including US presidents.\n\nHowever, as the years passed, the 747 faced increasing competition from newer, more efficient aircraft. As airlines shifted focus to shorter, point-to-point flights, the 747's market share diminished. In 2016, Boeing announced the end of 747 production after nearly 50 years in service.\n\nThe final \"Queen of the Skies\" will now be repurposed for cargo and freight transport, but its legacy will endure, thanks to its numerous contributions to the aviation industry.\n\nThe delivery of the last 747 is a bittersweet occasion, marking both the end of an era and a celebration of its remarkable achievements.\n\n\"The 747 brought people together and changed the way people travel,\" said Marc Allen, president of Boeing Commercial Airplanes. \"It's the most recognizable airplane ever built and still holds a special place in the hearts of aviation enthusiasts worldwide.\"\n\nDespite its detractors, the 747 leaves behind an impressive legacy, one that will be remembered for years to come. So, while it may be the end of the line for the 747, its iconic status as the \"Queen of the Skies\" will remain forever.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "The Green Bay Packers made a resounding declaration on Sunday evening, their dominance over the Minnesota Vikings a testament to their growing momentum towards a postseason appearance.\n\nAaron Rodgers orchestrated the offense with precision, throwing four touchdown passes while Aaron Jones and Jamaal Williams combined for nearly 200 rushing yards. Meanwhile, the Packers' defense successfully neutralized Minnesota quarterback Kirk Cousins, limiting him to ordinary statistics in a 24-17 victory.\n\nThis win brings the Packers (11-3) one step closer to securing a playoff spot, and if they can maintain their current level of performance, they may be poised for a deep run in January.\n\nRodgers was the standout performer against the Vikings, completing 22 of 28 passes for 230 yards, four touchdowns, and zero interceptions. He achieved this impressive feat without the services of his top two wide receivers, Davante Adams and Allen Lazard, who were sidelined due to injury.\n\nTight end Robert Tonyan emerged as a key target for Rodgers, hauling in a career-high six receptions for 98 yards and two touchdowns. Tonyan's performance should earn him the recognition he deserves, as he is rapidly becoming one of the league's top tight ends.\n\nThe Packers' running game was equally impressive, with Jones and Williams combining for 149 yards and a touchdown on 30 carries. The duo's effectiveness kept the Vikings' defense on its heels throughout the contest.\n\nThe Packers' defense also deserves credit for its performance, successfully containing Cousins and the Vikings' offense. Cousins was limited to 172 passing yards and one touchdown, while the Packers forced three turnovers \u2013 one fumble and two interceptions.\n\nThe win over the Vikings was a significant milestone for the Packers, and it should help them secure a playoff spot. However, they still have two challenging games remaining on their schedule, and they will need to maintain their winning streak to ensure a successful postseason run.\n\nFor now, the Packers can bask in the knowledge that they are one win away from securing a playoff berth, having accomplished this feat in style with a convincing victory over the Vikings. If they can sustain their current level of performance, they will be a formidable opponent for any team in the playoffs.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "The tale of Gabriela Arroyo, a 29-year-old Puerto Rican entrepreneur, takes an unexpected turn as she finds herself cohabiting with her partner, Fara, in the same bedroom, in their parents' house. \"It was an uncomfortable situation, but it felt like it was the only option,\" Gabriela explains. With her start-up already underway, Gabriela faced limited options for renting an apartment of her own, either by relocating out of San Juan or spending more than she could afford.\n\nHowever, her luck changes when she and Fara discover an affordable 3-bedroom apartment in the heart of the metropolitan area, close to parks, restaurants, and other entertainment options. \"The fact that there was a 3-bedroom at a very reasonable price was exactly what we needed to get out of our parents' house,\" Gabriela says.\n\nGabriela and Fara are among many Puerto Rican millennials struggling to afford housing in San Juan. According to a report, the median rent in the metropolitan area for a one-bedroom apartment was $718 in 2019, and for a two-bedroom apartment, $955. For young people who have just moved out of their parents' house and don't have steady jobs, these amounts are often too high. The report also shows that the average house costs around $140,000, and can go up to $250,000, making saving up for a down payment seem like a daunting task.\n\nGabriela, who currently earns $1,000/month with her company, shares that the ideal was finding a place that allows her to save up to eventually become a homeowner. \"We finally found an apartment that we could afford. We're paying a fixed rent of $1,000 per month, and it's a 3-bedroom apartment,\" she says.\n\nGabriela emphasizes that their biggest priority was to find a safe place to live in, close to the city center, and at a price that wouldn't leave them with very little money for other expenses. \"We have enough space for both of us and a room that we can use as a home office,\" she says.\n\nRenting can be a great option for those looking for an affordable and flexible way to live in Puerto Rico's metropolitan area. The most important thing is to do your research and know exactly what you're looking for in an apartment.\n\n\"It's important to know exactly what you can afford and look for options that have reasonable prices,\" Gabriela advises. Gabriela is living proof that you don't need to be rich to find a safe and comfortable place to call home. To her, the most important thing is to stay true to your needs, do your homework, and find the right option.\n\nNow, after two years of living in her own space, Gabriela advises young Puerto Ricans looking for an affordable place to rent to consider not just the price but also the location and the amenities in the area. \"We have saved a lot of money and time by living in the city center. It was worth the effort,\" she says.\n\nGabriela and Fara are examples of the younger generation in Puerto Rico who are looking for ways to make their dreams of independence come true.

{"text": "The recent report by Platts, an energy research firm, reveals that natural gas prices in Europe have reached a milestone, returning to their pre-conflict levels. This development signifies a shift towards stability in the region's energy markets, benefiting both producers and consumers.\n\nDuring the Ukraine-Russia conflict, Russia's decision to cut off natural gas supplies led to a surge in prices as countries scrambled to find alternative energy sources. This prompted a surge in renewable energy projects and investment in shale gas exploration. The subsequent agreement between the European Union and Russia restored natural gas supplies, providing stability to the energy markets.\n\nThe restored confidence in supplies has encouraged producers to invest in new projects, including shale gas exploration and renewable energy initiatives. This news is also welcomed by consumers, as reduced prices will help lower their energy bills. Furthermore, increased investment in energy infrastructure could lead to job creation and economic growth.\n\nWhile the situation remains fragile, the restored stability in energy prices could be a sign of sustained economic growth. However, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine may still impact the European energy markets in the future. For now, the news is a positive sign for Europe's energy markets, and only time will tell if prices will remain stable in the long term.", "label": "machine"}

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nA snowy owl that looks like it should be flying about the wintry wizarding world of Harry Potter has been spotted among the palm trees of beachy Southern California.\n\nSnowy owls are native to the Arctic tundra, where their largely white coats camouflage them in the snow, according to the National Audubon Society, which protects birds across the Americas.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re most common in very, very North Canada,\u201d said Jaret Davey, a wildlife technician and volunteer coordinator at the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center in Huntington Beach, California. \u201cThe southern limit of their winter range is in the northern United States. So it\u2019s not uncommon for them to be in Washington or Minnesota or Maine in the winter. But to be this far south is really exceptional.\u201d\n\nPictured is the snowy owl perched on a rooftop in a neighborhood in Cypress, California, on December 31, 2022. David Crane/MediaNews Group/Los Angeles Daily News/Getty Images\n\nResidents in a neighborhood in Cypress, California \u2014 about 25 miles south of downtown Los Angeles \u2014 got a Christmas miracle when the owl first appeared in mid-December. It has been spotted every day since December 27.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s astonishing to see a snowy owl in Southern California,\u201d said Chris Spurgeon, program chair and member of the board of directors at the Pasadena Audubon Society, a local chapter of the National Audubon Society serving the Greater Pasadena area of California.\n\nSpurgeon and Davey aren\u2019t alone in their excitement. There have been hundreds of people admiring the owl some days, and some have traveled hundreds of miles, Davey said.\n\n\u201cIn February \u2026 I flew to Manitoba (Canada), and then drove several hours north just to see a snowy owl,\u201d Davey said. \u201cIt was 25 degrees below zero in northern Canada. I never thought I\u2019d see one standing in my shirtsleeves on a suburban street in 70-degree weather.\u201d\n\nSnowy owls are classified as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources\u2019 2021 Red List of Threatened Species. There are fewer than 500,000 snowy owls in the world, which isn\u2019t a huge number \u201cwhen it comes to birds,\u201d Spurgeon said.\n\n\u201cWe could be vastly wrong with that number because they do live so far away from most people,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd unfortunately, many birds are threatened by climate change. With the changing conditions in the Arctic, it\u2019s affecting them as well as everyone else.\u201d\n\nOrigin story unknown\n\nNo one knows exactly why and how the West Coast snowy owl got to a place so far from its natural habitat, but bird experts have a few theories.\n\n\u201cBirds that migrate do occasionally do crazy things: go in the wrong direction, go too far, migrate at the wrong time of year, stuff like that,\u201d Spurgeon said.\n\nThis can also happen if a bird is young and hasn\u2019t migrated many times before, Davey said. The brown spots on snowy owls\u2019 feathers usually get wider as they age, so the size of the California owl\u2019s spots suggest it could have been born within the last couple years, Spurgeon said.\n\nThe owl could have hitched a ride on a passing cargo ship while flying across the sea, went all the way to a seaport and found itself back on land, Spurgeon and Davey said. It also could have escaped from being illegally kept as a pet.\n\n\u201cOftentimes with really beautiful animals like the snowy owl, people will get them on a black market and then illegally keep them as pets,\u201d Davey said. However, he said the owl did not appear to have a leg band, clipped talons or clipped wings that would suggest they had been kept in captivity.\n\nThis snowy owl\u2019s future\n\nWhen Spurgeon saw the snowy owl, it didn\u2019t look emaciated or unhealthy, he said. But some birdwatchers did think the owl might have been experiencing symptoms of heat stress during the first couple of days, Davey said.\n\n\u201cIt looked like it was breathing really heavy. Its feathers were all fluffed up to try to shed heat,\u201d Davey added. \u201cSince then, it seems to have been doing just fine.\u201d\n\nSouthern California is relatively cold now, but the owl could be at risk when the weather warms up in the spring, Davey said.\n\nSnowy owls are carnivores and typically eat small rodents \u2014 especially lemmings \u2014 but can eat animals as big as geese, Davey said.\n\nWith parks, open fields and grasslands nearby, experts think the owl shouldn\u2019t have difficulty finding food during its stay. In fact, there has already been evidence that the owl has been eating well \u2014 in a pellet the owl regurgitated, staff at the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center found a whole skeleton of what might have been a gopher.\n\n\u201cAll owls do regurgitate small little pellets just of indigestible material because, unlike us, where (when) we eat a piece of meat we eat around the bone, birds of prey just eat the whole thing,\u201d Davey said. \u201cFor the small little bones they can\u2019t digest, they just cough it back up.\u201d", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI is set to have his funeral on Thursday morning at 9:30 a.m. (CET). He died in Vatican City on Dec. 31 at the age of 95.\n\nBenedict XVI\u2019s body was transferred to St. Peter\u2019s Basilica on Monday, where it will remain for the lying in state through Jan. 4. Hundreds of thousands have already visited and viewing is open until 7 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nPope Benedict XVI\u2019s passing comes after 10 years in papal retirement, during which he lived at the Mater Ecclesiae Monastery in the Vatican Gardens. The pope emeritus was the first pope in 600 years to resign from office in February 2013, saying that he had to acknowledge his \u201cincapacity to adequately fulfill the ministry entrusted\u201d to him.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know about his funeral.\n\nWhere and when is his funeral?\n\nPope Benedict will be interred in a traditional cypress casket, and then carried into St. Peter\u2019s Square on Thursday at 8:45 a.m., for the recital of the rosary about 45 minutes before the mass.\n\nPope Francis will preside over the funeral mass, though Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re will be the main celebrant at the altar.\n\nLive streams of the funeral will be available on the Vatican\u2019s Youtube Channel.\n\nWho is expected to attend?\n\nMore than 60,000 people are expected to attend the funeral.\n\nDelegations representing Germany (Benedict\u2019s home country) and Italy were invited to attend the funeral, per a statement from the Holy See Press Office.\n\nKing Philippe and Queen Mathilde of Belgium confirmed they will attend the ceremony. As did Queen Sofia of Spain, who is going in representation of her son, King Felipe. Other heads of state, including the presidents of Poland, Germany and Hungary are also expected to attend, according to the Catholic News Agency.\n\nJoe Donnelly, U.S. ambassador to the Holy See, will also be present, in a decision that White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said was in line with the wishes of the late Pope and the Vatican.\n\nCardinals and archbishops from several countries will also be expected to attend.\n\nWhat to expect from the service\n\nVatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni told the press that the funeral service will be simple to honor the wishes of Pope Benedict.\n\nAnd since Benedict XVI was not the reigning pope at the time of his death, there will be some changes to his memorial service. Most significantly, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) reports, two final prayers from the diocese of Rome and the Eastern rite churches will not be recited because these are specifically meant to honor a presiding pope.\n\n\u201cThe liturgical celebration follows the model of a funeral service for a supreme pontiff,\u201d Bruni told the press on Tuesday. New elements to the funeral will instead be added to give the ceremony \u2018its originality.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe first reading, for instance, will be from the Book of Isaiah, instead of a passage from the Acts of Apostles, as it was at St. John Paul II\u2019s funeral. The second reading will also be distinct, with a passage from the first letter of St. Peter that discusses the eternal life promised to God\u2019s children.\n\nFollowing the mass, Benedict\u2019s casket will be sealed and wrapped with ribbons before it is placed into two more caskets of zinc and wood, per the USCCB.\n\nWhere is he being buried?\n\nPope Benedict XVI will be buried in Pope John Paul\u2019s II first tomb, which is less than 100 feet from the Tomb of St. Peter. (John Paul II was moved to a chapel in the basilica in 2011 after he was beatified).\n\nA \u201crogito,\u201d or one-page scroll accounting the highlights of Benedict\u2019s papacy will be placed into a metal cylinder and into his coffin for burial, along with medals, palliums and Vatican coins minted during his reign, according to the USCCB..\n\nThe final moments of Benedict XVI\u2019s burial will be done in private.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The proposed Digital Labour Code in Russia has sparked concerns among IT professionals, who fear that it may lead to a decrease in wages and job security.\n\nThe code, introduced by the Russian Ministry of Labour and Social Protection, aims to regulate remote work and freelancing. However, critics argue that it may give employers too much power to dictate remote work arrangements, potentially leading to exploitation.\n\nUnder the proposed legislation, employers could require some employees to work remotely, which could affect millions of IT professionals. Workers would be compensated for losses incurred due to remote work, but could also face sanctions if they fail to meet employer expectations.\n\nThe code has been met with backlash from IT workers, who fear that it will make it easier for employers to abuse their power and exploit remote workers. They also worry that it may lead to a decrease in foreign investment, as investors may be deterred by the lack of protections for workers' rights.\n\nOpponents of the code argue that it undermines the competitiveness of Russia's IT sector and could lead to a \"brain drain\" of IT professionals, as those with the skills to find employment abroad may leave the country in search of higher wages.\n\nThe proposed legislation has been criticized by various groups, including the business community, trade unions, and civil society.

{"text": "Winding paths of pecuniary misadventure are a common phenomenon, often resulting from poor decision-making, unsound counsel, or inadequate research. These blunders can be financially devastating, and in some cases, calamitous.\n\nRegrettably, failing to learn from one's mistakes is not an option, but acknowledging and addressing them is crucial to avoiding further fiscal missteps. As the year draws to a close, it is an opportune moment to reassess one's financial strategy and sidestep these common pitfalls.\n\nFailing to Monitor One's Expenses\n\nTo truly comprehend one's financial situation, it is essential to track one's expenditures. Although this may require effort and discipline, it is a critical step in making informed decisions regarding the allocation of one's hard-earned resources. Neglecting to monitor one's spending, whether during the holiday season or at any other time, can be a costly error.\n\nFortunately, budgeting apps and programs make it easy to monitor one's expenses, rendering it inexcusable not to be aware of one's financial situation. By keeping tabs on one's money, one will be better equipped to make prudent financial decisions, such as when to invest, save, or make a purchase.\n\nLack of an Emergency Fund\n\nFinancial planning for the future is vital, but having an emergency fund for the present is equally important. It is essential to have a backup plan in the event of a life-altering event, such as job loss, medical emergency, or unexpected car repair. A recent study conducted by the Federal Reserve found that 40 percent of Americans do not have the funds to cover a $400 emergency expense.\n\nFinancial experts often advise setting aside three to six months' worth of living expenses in an emergency fund. This not only provides a cushion in the event of an emergency but also prevents one from going into debt to pay for it. To make saving easier, consider setting up an automatic transfer to one's emergency fund each month.\n\nCarrying Excessive Debt\n\nDebt, while sometimes unavoidable, can quickly spiral out of control. High-interest debt, such as credit card debt, is especially problematic and should be eliminated as soon as possible. This can be accomplished by setting up a plan to pay off the debt in the most efficient manner possible, such as through the \"debt avalanche\" method, which involves paying off the debt with the highest interest rate first.\n\nAdditionally, try to pay more than the minimum each month, as this will help one pay off the debt quicker and save on interest payments. However, if debt payments become unmanageable, consider seeking help through a nonprofit credit counseling organization like the National Foundation for Credit Counseling.\n\nNot Diversifying One's Investments\n\nInvesting is a great way to achieve financial growth and increase net worth, but it is essential to be strategic about it. While it is possible to reap big rewards from a single high-risk investment, diversifying one's portfolio with a mix of investments is generally the best route to a solid financial future.\n\nWhen it comes to diversifying one's investments, consider different types of investments such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and real estate. The idea is to spread one's money among different asset classes and industries so that if one investment tanks, one still has other investments that are more likely to perform well.\n\nNot Making Retirement a Priority\n\nSaving for retirement should always be a priority, but many Americans delay this important step, opting instead to spend their money on other things. However, failing to prepare for retirement can lead to financial difficulties down the line. And this is not just a problem for those in their 40s and beyond; even if one is in their 20s or 30s, it is essential to start saving for retirement as soon as possible.\n\nFortunately, there are several retirement savings vehicles that can help one build a nest egg, including 401(k)s, IRAs, and even health savings accounts. The sooner one starts taking advantage of these options, the better off one will be when it is time to retire.\n\nNot Shopping Around for the Best Rates and Deals\n\nWhether one is taking out a loan, signing up for a credit card, or signing a contract for a service, it is essential to compare different lenders, cards, and offers to find the best deals. Failing to shop around for the best rates and deals can end up costing one more in the long run, as some offers come with much better terms than others.\n\nFortunately, finding the best offers has become easier than ever with comparison websites, which allow one to quickly compare multiple offers and make an informed decision. It pays to spend a little time doing the research.", "label": "machine"}

Check out the video above for our first look, and read on for the details.\n\nA 17-Inch, Performance-First Design\n\nThe Raider GE78 isn\u2019t the most powerful option in MSI\u2019s lineup\u2014leave that to the company\u2019s monstrous Titan laptop (the last Titan model we reviewed is here, and a new edition is also coming in 2023)\u2014but it is the more reasonable next step down. At 17 inches and 6.6 pounds, the Raider is far more about power and performance than portability, so you should eye this as a desktop replacement that can move when you need it to. There\u2019s also a smaller Raider GE68.\n\n(Credit: Kyle Cobian)\n\nBeyond the size, let's first talk about the style. It\u2019s mostly black, though there is some chic copper trim on the rear. The single most eye-catching facet, though, is by far the front-facing LED matrix light bar. This is an evolution of the front edge lighting we've seen before, as on the Raider GE67 HX.\n\n(Credit: Kyle Cobian)\n\nThis light bar is customizable with MSI\u2019s Mystic Light software utility, bringing a load of flash to an otherwise pretty restrained design. The bold LEDs pop more than the traditional style, and while that will probably be divisive to a degree, there\u2019s no denying it will grab the attention of anyone in sight of this notebook. The lid logo is also RGB lit, and the keyboard features per-key customizable lighting as well.\n\nA Spacious Screen and High-End Parts for a Desktop-Like Experience\n\nMoving on to that big display, it\u2019s available with a QHD+ 240Hz panel, or a 4K 120Hz version. The screen is sharp, very roomy, and ready for gaming at either resolution, though you\u2019ll really need to go for broke in terms of top-end components for gaming on a 4K 120Hz panel. And I do mean \u201cgo for broke\u201d: the top configurations for this laptop are around $4,000.\n\n(Credit: Kyle Cobian)\n\nNow, as for what those models will pack inside, precise details aren\u2019t available just yet, but the Raider will feature components from the top half of Nvidia and Intel\u2019s 2023 silicon stacks. Particularly in those souped-up or maxed-out configurations that cost around $4,000, this machine should deliver a high-fidelity laptop gaming experience. We\u2019ll have to test the performance ourselves to confirm that when we can, but it\u2019s clear even on paper that this is far from a budget gaming option.\n\n(Credit: Kyle Cobian)\n\nFinally, the Raider includes some other notable features, like a dedicated MUX switch, which allows the GPU to send display data directly through to the panel for increased performance. This switch also lets you manually toggle the integrated graphics on and off. The Raider is packed with a 99.9 watt-hour battery, though we still wouldn\u2019t expect battery life to be great on this big system, and features a full HD IR camera with Windows Hello.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "A recent revelation has emerged in a sensational case involving the untimely demise of three family members in Idaho.\n\nOn July 15, 2019, Chad Daybell and Lori Vallow were apprehended in connection with the disappearance of her two offspring, Tylee Ryan and JJ Vallow, whose lifeless bodies were later discovered in the backyard of Chad Daybell's residence in Salem, Idaho.\n\nIn addition to the missing children, the deaths of Lori Vallow's estranged spouse, Charles Vallow, and her sibling, Alex Cox, are also under scrutiny.\n\nNewly released court documents have shed additional light on the enigmatic case. According to the documents, a roommate of the three deceased family members informed authorities that he heard someone sobbing and witnessed a male individual wearing a mask at the residence on the morning of the murders.\n\nThe roommate, who was residing with Charles Vallow, Alex Cox, and Lori Vallow at the time of the murders, claimed that he heard the sound of someone crying in the adjacent room around 3:00 a.m. on July 11, 2019. He then arose to investigate, but was unable to see anyone.\n\nThe individual stated that he heard the sound of a door closing a few minutes later and returned to bed. The next morning, he told authorities that he observed a male individual wearing a ski mask in the driveway. He described the individual as tall, with short hair, and wearing a brown jacket. The individual then entered a silver-colored vehicle and departed.\n\nThe roommate also reported hearing Charles Vallow engage in an argument with a female earlier that morning. He claimed that the female uttered the phrase \"Don't do it, don't do it!\"\n\nThe court documents also revealed the presence of a surveillance camera at the residence where the murders took place. Surveillance footage shows two vehicles entering the driveway shortly after the argument. One of the vehicles matched the description provided by the roommate, a silver-colored car.\n\nThe court documents do not specify who was in the vehicle, and the investigation is ongoing.\n\nAuthorities are also investigating potential connections between the deaths of the three family members and Chad Daybell, Lori Vallow's fifth spouse. Daybell is currently incarcerated, awaiting trial on charges related to concealing the deaths of Tylee Ryan and JJ Vallow.\n\nVallow and Daybell are scheduled to appear in court for a preliminary hearing next month. The newly released court documents provide additional information for prosecutors to utilize during the trial.\n\nThe mysterious case has sent shockwaves through the small community of Salem, Idaho, where the three family members were killed. Residents have expressed fear and anxiety in the wake of the murders, as authorities continue to investigate the case.\n\nIf found guilty, Vallow and Daybell could both face the death penalty. In the meantime, the newly released court documents have provided a few more clues to a case that has captivated the nation.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "It's undeniable that the cost of higher education has become increasingly burdensome. The exponential rise in tuition fees has led to a significant number of students and families grappling with unsustainable debt. As a result, an increasing number of students are opting for alternative paths.\n\nFor some, attending college is simply not a viable option due to the mounting expenses. The cumulative effect of rising tuition, living costs, and the escalating prices of textbooks and supplies can be overwhelming for many students and their families. However, other factors are also at play.\n\nThe traditional college experience has undergone significant changes in recent years. For some students, the college experience is no longer a top priority. Many potential students are now opting for online programs and other forms of education that offer similar value at a fraction of the cost. Additionally, some students are seeking alternatives such as coding bootcamps or accelerated degree programs.\n\nBeyond cost, college may no longer be the optimal choice for certain career paths. In an era where technology is rapidly evolving, skills like coding and engineering can be acquired more quickly through boot camps and other forms of short-term training. This alternative approach enables students to gain the skills necessary to make an immediate impact in the job market.\n\nSome students may also find that the traditional college experience is not a good fit for them. The academic and social atmosphere of college may not be conducive to their learning style or preferences. Traditional college education may no longer be an attractive option for those seeking a more focused and specialized experience.\n\nIt's also essential to acknowledge that some students may be skipping college due to the stigma associated with it. For some, college is perceived as a measure of success or failure, and a reflection of their intelligence or abilities. The fear of not succeeding or fitting in can be a powerful deterrent, and some students opt for alternative paths to avoid this pressure.\n\nThe trend of skipping college is particularly prevalent among minority students. Many of these students come from low-income households and struggle to make ends meet. Furthermore, many of these students may not have access to the same level of academic resources as their peers, leading them to feel that college may not be the best option for them.\n\nIt's hardly surprising that more and more students are choosing to skip college. With rising costs and shifting attitudes towards education, it's clear that traditional college education is no longer the only path to success. It's crucial for students and parents to explore all their options to make the best decision for their future. Whether it's college, an alternative route, or even a combination of the two, there is a path for every student that leads to success.", "label": "machine"}

Pope Francis presided over the funeral at St. Peter's Square in the Vatican, marking the end of an era.\n\nThe ceremony was attended by a large crowd of clergy, religious leaders, cardinals, and bishops, as well as representatives from various religions. Pope Francis delivered a eulogy, highlighting the life and legacy of his predecessor, Benedict XVI. He remembered the happy moments of Benedict's life, his years of service to the Catholic Church, his generosity, and his compassion.\n\nPope Francis also praised Benedict XVI for his fight for human rights, his devotion to prayer, his commitment to truth, and his dedication to maintaining the integrity of Catholic faith during his leadership. He described Benedict as a great guide, a model for all, and a faithful servant of Christ until the end of his days.\n\nThe Pope lit a candle in memory of Benedict XVI and presented his final wishes for prayer. The officiants sang the Mass for the eternal rest of the deceased Pope Benedict XVI. Pope Francis also offered a prayer for Benedict XVI, blessing his soul and wishing him a happy reunion with God.\n\nIn the evening, the Vatican lit a torch that will burn throughout the week in memory of Benedict XVI's life. During the funeral, representatives of the Catholic Church offered condolences to his closest family and friends. As the Catholic community mourned the loss of one of its greatest leaders, it also showed gratitude for Benedict XVI's example as a man and as Pope.\n\nPope Benedict XVI, who died at the age of 96, will be remembered as one of the greatest religious leaders in the Catholic Church. He was named Pope in 2005, following the resignation of John Paul II, and served for eight years until his resignation in 2013. During his papacy, Benedict XVI was a strong defender of Catholic doctrine and a great advocate for human rights and peace.\n\nThis funeral will become one of the most significant events in the history of the Catholic Church, and followers of Benedict XVI will keep a memory of his leadership and the influence he had on the Vatican and the Catholic Church.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "In the lead-up to Malaysia's national elections, political adversaries have engaged in a heated debate, with many focusing on the country's most significant controversy \u2013 a financial scandal involving 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).\n\nEstablished in 2009, 1MDB was a government-controlled entity aimed at transforming Malaysia into a global financial and investment hub. However, it was subsequently scrutinized and accused of mismanagement and corruption. The US Department of Justice alleged that $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB between 2009 and 2014.\n\nThe scandal has since become a pivotal campaign issue in Malaysia, with both sides accusing one another of involvement in the scandal and not taking sufficient action to recover funds stolen from 1MDB.\n\nThe ruling coalition, led by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and his Pakatan Harapan (PH) party, has capitalized on the opportunity to demonstrate its commitment to eradicating corruption and mismanagement in the country. It has also attempted to portray its rivals, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) and its coalition, the Barisan Nasional (BN), as responsible for the scandal and its aftermath.\n\nMeanwhile, the opposition has utilized the scandal to criticize the ruling coalition, accusing it of not doing enough to address the issue. The opposition has also sought to distance itself from any involvement in the scandal.\n\nTo further demonstrate its commitment to tackling corruption and malpractice, the PH government has launched a series of investigations into 1MDB and its related entities. The government has also pledged to recover some of the money misappropriated from 1MDB.\n\nThe government has also been attempting to reassure investors that it has taken steps to strengthen corporate governance and address the issue.\n\nAt the same time, the opposition has argued that PH is politicizing the 1MDB scandal and has not done enough to recover the money that was misappropriated. The opposition has also claimed that the government has been too slow to act and that its investigation has not been comprehensive enough. They have also accused the government of using the 1MDB scandal to divert attention away from its own record on corruption and transparency.\n\nIn recent weeks, the two sides have clashed over how to deal with the fallout from 1MDB. UMNO and its allies have criticized the PH government's efforts to pursue those responsible and to recover the misappropriated funds.\n\nThe opposition has argued that the government's approach has been too slow, and that it has not done enough to crack down on the corruption associated with 1MDB.\n\nThe government has responded, accusing the opposition of not taking a strong stance against the scandal and of trying to shift the blame to others.\n\nIn a recent speech, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad stated that the government had done its best to investigate and recover the money stolen from 1MDB. He also claimed that the opposition had not done enough to support the government's efforts to address the issue.\n\nAs the national elections draw near, the 1MDB scandal is likely to remain a significant issue in the run-up to the polls. Both sides are likely to continue using it as a campaign tool to gain public support and to discredit one another.\n\nThe 1MDB scandal has thus far cost Malaysia an estimated $7.5 billion, and the country is still in the process of recovering the money that was misappropriated. How the two sides address the scandal in the coming weeks could have a major impact on how the Malaysian public views them and their records on corruption and transparency.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "In the realm of digital communication, where image manipulation and content editing are ubiquitous, a novel application is challenging the status quo.\n\nBeReal, a social media platform, is advocating for authenticity by prohibiting edited photographs. The app permits users to share only unaltered images of themselves and express their genuine thoughts, feelings, and experiences.\n\nThe concept behind BeReal originated from its creator, Shannon Harrington, who aimed to establish a platform where individuals could express themselves without relying on the crutch of digital alteration.\n\nHarrington expressed her frustration with the societal emphasis on physical appearance, stating, \"I believe everyone is beautiful in their own right, and editing photos diminishes that beauty. I want BeReal to be a platform where people can be 100 percent themselves and be proud of it.\"\n\nBeReal's mission is to eliminate the reliance on filters and editing apps, which it believes hinder individuals from accepting themselves for who they are. To ensure that edited photos are not posted on the app, the company employs a sophisticated algorithm to detect and flag edited images.\n\nThe algorithm works by identifying specific patterns and facial features that have been modified. It can also detect any additional information, such as lighting or color correction, applied to the image. If a photo is flagged as edited, users are given the option to either delete it or keep it, but it will not be publicly posted until it has been verified as unedited.\n\nThe app's purpose is to create a safe space where individuals can be their authentic selves without the pressure of conforming to societal beauty standards. Users can create posts, stories, and galleries showcasing their genuine selves, all without the use of filters or editing.\n\nThe app also features a community section, where users can connect and share their stories and experiences. BeReal hopes this will enable users to form deeper connections and offer support to one another's personal journeys.\n\nThus far, the app has received a positive response and is growing in popularity. While not everyone is receptive to the concept, most users agree that it is a refreshing change in a world where image manipulation has become the norm.\n\nBeReal is part of a growing movement of applications, websites, and brands encouraging users to embrace their true selves and practice self-love and acceptance. This wave of self-acceptance is gradually transforming the way we perceive and present ourselves online.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Apple is widely rumored to be releasing augmented-reality/virtual-reality glasses in 2023.\n\nIt needs another hit product. But AR/VR glasses have struggled with consumers.\n\nApple will likely not succeed in this market, either.

But they are much like ordering fries and a drink to go with a burger. They don't create an ecosystem that Apple can grow. They rely on the iPhone's ecosystem.\n\nIt has long been rumored that Apple will create a car to take on the likes of Tesla. That would be an example of a new market for Apple. But I don't think an Apple car is going to happen, and that's a topic for another time.\n\nWhat does seem likely is that Apple will release augmented-reality/virtual-reality glasses, rumored to be coming in 2023 with an OS called xrOS.\n\nWhile I'm always excited to see what innovations companies like Apple have in store, I have some serious concerns about betting on AR/VR glasses as a growth market.\n\nWe've already seen some attempts in this space, including Microsoft HoloLens and Magic Leap. They have not exactly taken the world by storm. When was the last time you or anyone you know saw someone using those devices at their places of work or out in the wild? Glass from Google, I think it's safe to say, was a failure. And Snapchat's Spectacles are not even for sale to the general public, the company's website says, only to developers.\n\nThen there are VR products like Oculus from Meta and competitors from Valve, Sony, and HP. These have made some inroads with gamers, but years after they were introduced, they're still a small fraction of the enormous video-gaming market.\n\nAs for other uses? We have, so far, seen none, despite Mark Zuckerberg's die-hard belief that the metaverse is the future of our social lives and work meetings and whatnot.\n\nThere is a belief, however, that Apple \u2014 which isn't usually first to market \u2014 can enter a space and succeed where no one has before.\n\nWhen it comes to this market, I'm more than a little skeptical. First and foremost, the battery life of an AR device is a major concern. AR, as Google Glass and Snapchat Spectacles envisioned it, is meant to be worn for long periods of time and superimpose digital imagery and functions onto the real world.\n\nWhile Apple has not released specifications on this front (or any other), it seems highly unlikely that any device in this category will work for extended periods without recharging. Plus, despite all the ways that Apple is a leader in elegant hardware design, battery life is not really its strong point. (In the world of smartwatches, for example, some Garmin devices last as long as two weeks, reviewers found, while an Apple Watch, in my experience, gives a user two or three days.)\n\nThere's also the question of comfort. Glasses are not the most comfortable things to wear for extended periods of time. And when you add the weight and bulk of the technology needed for AR and VR, eyewear like this become more uncomfortable to wear.\n\nThis is not to mention the fact that many people simply do not like wearing glasses at all, which will limit the market for these products.\n\nPrice is another major issue. Microsoft's HoloLens costs between $3,500 and $5,200. Apple's device is widely expected to be in the $1,000 to $1,500 price range, even though Apple is known for selling premium devices with premium price tags. But even on the low end, that's a significant investment for a product that will do far less than a comparably priced MacBook or iPad.\n\nBeyond the practical concerns of battery life, comfort, and price, there's the fundamental issue of the lack of a compelling use case for AR or VR glasses.\n\nWhile these technologies have some exciting potential, it is not yet clear, beyond certain types of video games, what the killer app will be to make them a must-have for consumers.\n\nAll that is to say, while Apple's AR/VR project may be interesting to die-hard Apple fans and tech enthusiasts who buy into Apple's marketing machine and wait in lines to buy its products on day one, I don't believe it's the company's next big thing.\n\nUntil Apple, or any other company, can demonstrate a truly compelling reason for large numbers of people to want to wear AR around, or add VR to their quiver of home-entertainment options, I fear that the tech will struggle to gain widespread adoption. There is a reason Oculus devices have created a category known as \"closetware,\" a gadget that winds up stored and forgotten somewhere in a closet.\n\nMichael Gartenberg is a former senior marketing executive at Apple and has covered the company for more than two decades as a market-research analyst at Gartner, Jupiter Research, and Altimeter Group.

{"text": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Dhara Ranasinghe\n\nForget peak U.S. interest rates for a minute, markets already want to know when the Federal Reserve will start making cuts -- later this year, if money market futures are to be believed.\n\nAny upcoming data, therefore, should be viewed in the context of that debate and the pushback investors are likely to get from Fed officials.\n\nIndeed, minutes from the Fed's December meeting, released on Wednesday, cautioned against expectations for late-year rate cuts that traders have priced in. And Gita Gopinath, a deputy managing director at the International Monetary Fund, warns U.S. inflation has not \"turned the corner yet\" and it is too early for the Fed to declare victory.\n\nMarkets, renowned for running ahead of time, are not buying that argument. They price in roughly 40 basis points worth of rate cuts in the second half of the year and the key is whether inflation will slow enough for the Fed to ease.\n\nEssential to that outlook is, of course, the labour market, putting Thursday's weekly jobs data, a precursor to Friday's closely-watched non-farm payrolls report, in the spotlight.\n\nThe December ADP National Employment report is released later on and economists polled by Reuters expect it to show private employment increased by 150,000 jobs after a 127,000 increase in November.\n\nNote, data on Wednesday showed U.S. job openings fell less than expected in November as the labour market remains tight, which could see the Federal Reserve boosting interest rates even more than currently anticipated to tame inflation.\n\nSo perhaps it is too early to be talking about rate cuts?\n\nMoving on, there are two other noteworthy factors to draw attention to.\n\nThe first is China's battle with COVID and what that means for the reopening of the economy. China on Thursday defended its handling of its raging COVID-19 outbreak after U.S. President Joe Biden voiced concern and the World Health Organization said Beijing was under-reporting deaths from the virus.\n\nSecond is a slump in energy prices. European gas prices are now at their lowest since late 2021, helping ease concern about a deep recession, especially in the euro area.\n\nStill, U.S. stock futures point to a weak start for Wall Street shares , and European shares are a touch softer too. But Asian shares, outside Japan, briefly touched a four-month high, driven by hopes over China reopening (.MIAPJ0000PUS).\n\nGas prices are falling fast\n\nKey developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Thursday:\n\n- U.S. Nov trade data.\n\n- Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic\n\n- Amazon CEO says job cuts to exceed 18,000 roles\n\nReporting by Dhara Ranasinghe; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n\nOpinions expressed are those of the author.

{"text": "The labor market's extraordinary growth rate has been tempered by the Federal Reserve's recent measures to curb its momentum.\n\nAccording to the Labor Department's latest report, job openings decreased by 389,000 in October, representing a 2.9% decline from the previous month. The total number of job openings in October stood at 12.87 million, down from 13.26 million in September.\n\nThese developments follow the Federal Reserve's introduction of measures to moderate the job market, including imposing a cap on corporate buybacks and suspending stock dividends. These steps aim to limit companies' spending on their own stock, thereby encouraging them to invest in job creation and wage increases instead.\n\nNotwithstanding this slowdown, the labor market remains robust. The Labor Department reported that the economy added 638,000 jobs in October, the highest monthly gain since the recovery began in May. The unemployment rate has also decreased to 6.9%, down from 7.9% in September.\n\nHowever, job growth has slowed in recent months, with employment increasing by just 1.8 million over the past three months, compared to more than 4 million in the preceding three-month period. This deceleration is attributed to various factors, including a surge in coronavirus cases, uncertainty surrounding the election, and the lack of additional federal stimulus.\n\nAs of October, there were nearly 11 million unemployed individuals, with unemployment rates ranging from 10.8% for African-Americans to 6.7% for Asian-Americans.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's efforts to temper the job market appear to be having an impact, as the number of job openings has been declining in recent months. It remains to be seen whether these efforts will be sufficient to slow hiring in the coming months or if companies will continue to hire as the economy recovers.\n\nThe October job openings report also highlighted significant declines in hiring across various sectors, including construction, transportation, and retail. In contrast, the government sector experienced an 8.8% increase in job openings, while manufacturing and healthcare sectors saw small declines.\n\nThe report also showed that job openings in the professional and business services sector decreased by 4.1%, while openings in education and health services fell by 1.2%.\n\nWith job openings down, the U.S. economy is entering a period of slower job growth and weaker wage gains. The economy still has a long way to go before returning to pre-pandemic levels of employment, and the Federal Reserve's efforts to cool the job market may further slow the pace of hiring. Nevertheless, the October job openings report provides evidence that the central bank's efforts could be having an impact.", "label": "machine"}

They are currently being held at the Palm Beach County Jail on charges of burglary, larceny, and grand theft of over $300.\n\nThe individual's family released a statement expressing their concern and sadness over the recent events, saying they are \"working to provide whatever assistance we can to help support our son at this difficult time and ask that people respect our family's privacy during this trying period.\"\n\nThe individual's latest arrest serves as a reminder to always do thorough research before trusting someone or hiring someone for a job. While not everyone is a scammer, there are some individuals who will stop at nothing to get ahead, and it is best to err on the side of caution.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "The City of Chicago is being presented with a novel opportunity to revitalize the area surrounding Soldier Field by constructing a cutting-edge, domed sports and entertainment facility. The proposal, spearheaded by Richard M. Daley and his team of investors, envisions a state-of-the-art stadium with a capacity of 65,000, serving as the permanent home of the Chicago Bears while also functioning as a thriving commercial hub.\n\nThe proposed complex would feature an array of attractions, including restaurants, shops, office space, and entertainment and cultural venues, creating a vibrant destination for visitors. The Bears would be the primary tenant, but the stadium would also be equipped to host a range of events, such as concerts, conventions, and special events.\n\nWhile the proposal has its supporters, it has also garnered criticism from those who argue that the city should prioritize other pressing issues, such as education or infrastructure, rather than investing in a domed stadium. Others have expressed concerns about the potential impact on existing businesses in the area.\n\nMayor Lori Lightfoot has expressed her enthusiasm for the proposal, stating that she is pleased to see private investment groups driving forward a vision for an attractive destination in Chicago. However, she emphasized the need for thoughtful deliberation and consideration of various stakeholders, particularly the nearby neighborhoods.\n\nThe proposal is part of a larger effort to stimulate development in the area surrounding Soldier Field and to keep the Bears in Chicago, as the team has been considering a move outside the city for years. If approved, the domed stadium and its commercial complex could be completed as early as 2026, generating hundreds of millions of dollars for the city in the form of taxes and jobs.\n\nFor now, Mayor Lightfoot has indicated that her administration will continue to study the proposal and explore ways to make it work in the best interest of the city.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Natia and Jervais Seegars both opened their first credit cards when they were college students.\n\nThey racked up debt and had terrible credit, which held them back from buying a home.\n\nThey turned their finances around by tracking their spending and boosting their income.\n\nNatia and Jervais Seegars both opened their first credit cards when they were college students in the early 2000s.\n\nLike many young students, they didn't fully understand how credit worked. In fact, the main reason Jervais got one was because the credit card company was giving away free T-shirts to any student who signed up for a card.\n\n\"I was like, 'Oh, this is a cool shirt. Let me sign up for it,' not really knowing what it actually meant,\" he recalled.\n\nNatia remembers receiving a credit card in the mail without ever applying for one, she told Insider: \"Back then, companies used to send you a credit card in the mail and you would just activate it if you wanted it.\"\n\nShe ended up activating it and using it to pay for books and art supplies for her classes. Even though she consistently paid the minimum on time, she couldn't afford to pay her balance in full every month, meaning she was gradually accumulating interest and going deeper and deeper into debt.\n\nJervais also racked up credit card debt. By the time the couple decided they wanted to buy a home together, they were $8,300 in the red and had \"terrible credit,\" they told Insider. Jervais' credit score was 524 at its lowest.\n\nTheir debt and low credit scores held them back from buying property right away. They didn't qualify for a loan, explained Jervais: \"We got a lot of 'no's' from lenders.\"\n\nThe couple met when they were college students. Courtesy of Natia and Jervais Seegars\n\nThat's when they got serious about turning their finances around. After three years of paying down their debt, increasing their income, and boosting their credit, they qualified for a home loan and bought their first property in 2006 in North Carolina, where they both went to college.\n\nThey have been expanding their portfolio ever since. Today, Natia, 41, and Jervais, 43, own five properties that bring in $30,000 in monthly revenue, according to documents viewed by Insider \u2014 and their credit scores are above 800, they noted. They currently reside in the Bay Area but still own the first home they ever bought and rent it out.\n\nTheir real estate business allowed them to recently quit their 9-to-5 jobs \u2014 Jervais was an engineer, while Natia worked in marketing \u2014 and launch a coaching business, YourLifeStyleStrategy, in 2022 to help other people build wealth through real estate.\n\nAs they learned first-hand, \"if your finances aren't in order, it's going to be a very bumpy road,\" said Jervais.\n\nHere are the three strategies that helped them get their finances in order.\n\n1. They tracked their spending and stuck to a budget\n\nThe first change Natia and Jervais made was tracking their expenses. They started by simply writing down everything they bought.\n\n\"A lot of people think that a budget has to be really sophisticated,\" said Natia. \"Ours was literally handwritten on graphing paper. Back then, it was super expensive to buy Excel for the computer, so we just manually wrote every expense down.\"\n\nTracking their purchases helped them understand where their money was going and where they could cut back. They left room for some discretionary spending, \"because we still wanted to enjoy ourselves,\" said Natia, but they shifted their definition of a \"splurge.\" For example, \"our date night tradition was going to Sam's Club for the $1.50 combo. We'd get a soda and a hotdog for $1.50 and call it a splurge.\"\n\nThey had to make some bigger sacrifices, like skipping family trips and reunions, she added: \"We would have liked to have participated but sometimes it didn't match our budget, and we were very clear on what we wanted to accomplish.\"\n\nPlus, they refrained from upgrading certain aspects of their lives right away. For example, they lived in the off-campus studio apartment Jervais had been renting as a college student for $495 a month and they shared one car.\n\n2. They picked up extra shifts at work to increase their income\n\nIn addition to spending less, Natia and Jervais both picked up extra hours to boost their incomes. At the time, they were both waiting tables. Natia had just graduated from college and was able to work full-time, while Jervais was still in school and worked part-time.\n\nThey also found a promotional gig with a gum company that paid pretty well, said Jervais: \"When Dentyne Ice first came out, it was the new gum. We went to the campuses at UNC Chapel Hill and Duke University to pass out free gum and promote the brand.\"\n\nBesides asking for extra hours and finding side gigs, they were both able to increase their main source of income. After graduating in 2005, Jervais started a full-time engineering job. That same year, Natia started working in marketing and went from an hourly wage plus tips at the restaurant to earning a salary.\n\nLater in their careers, the couple employed what they call \"the 1% rule,\" said Natia. \"We would try to increase our income by 1% a month \u2014 or, 12% a year \u2014 and we would come up with strategies, whether that was asking for a raise from our current jobs, getting a new job, or increasing the rent of our investment property in North Carolina.\"\n\n3. They automated their savings\n\nOnce Natia and Jervais landed their salary-based jobs and were earning more consistent paychecks, they set up automatic transfers from their checking accounts to their savings accounts.\n\nThey picked $300 a month because that's the most they could afford to save at the time, they explained, and automatically transferred it to an account earmarked for their home purchase.\n\nThat's ultimately what helped them save enough money for the down payment and closing costs that came with their first home.\n\nBy putting their savings on autopilot, they couldn't ever skimp out, they explained. No matter what, $300 went into savings each month and, over time, they learned to live without that money.", "label": "human"}

It currently has 11 other inquiries open into Meta services.\n\nThe DPC said that as part of its decision, the EU's privacy watchdog had purported to direct the Irish regulator to conduct a fresh investigation that would span all of Facebook and Instagram's data processing operations.\n\nThe DPC said it was not open to the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) to direct an authority to engage in such investigations and that it intended to ask the EU Court of Justice to set aside the EDPB's direction as it may involve an \"overreach\".\n\n($1 = 0.9423 euros)\n\nReporting by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Mark Potter and Emelia Sithole-Matarise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Pictured here is a science-fiction themed installation at the Maison Hermes in Shanghai, China, on Nov. 28, 2022. Future Publishing | Future Publishing | Getty Images\n\nBEIJING \u2014 Wealthier Chinese were more inclined to spend this year, while poorer people cut back on spending even more, McKinsey and Company found in a survey released Thursday. The divergence contrasts with 2019, before the pandemic, when \"there was little differentiation in spending between the two groups,\" the McKinsey analysts said. They noted an official measure of consumer sentiment in China dropped this year to an all-time low. Lockdowns and travel restrictions to control Covid outbreaks in China grew more widespread this year as the more contagious Omicron variant entered the country. A property market slump also dragged down the economy. However, more than a quarter \u2014 or 26% \u2014 of people with an annual household income above 345,000 yuan ($49,286), said they increased spending by 5% or more from last year, the survey found. Only 14% of that income group said they significantly cut their spending.\n\nThe more affluent group continues to spend, while lower-income groups are more hesitant and hold spending decisions McKinsey and Company\n\nThe trend reversed for those with far lower income, below 85,000 yuan a year. Just 12% said they increased spending, while 27% scaled back, the report said. \"The more affluent population is more confident about their personal wealth and future prospects,\" McKinsey told CNBC in a statement. \"They remain relatively more confident about keeping employed in the future and anticipating salary increases in the future. They also typically already have higher savings.\" \"So, the more affluent group continues to spend, while lower-income groups are more hesitant and hold spending decisions.\" Across all income categories, the majority \u2014 or about 60% \u2014 reported no change in spending this year. The share of the wealthiest that said they spent more was also ten percentage points smaller than the 36% reported in 2019.\n\nwatch now\n\nMcKinsey's survey of more than 6,700 Chinese consumers was conducted in July. In the months since, national data on retail sales has slumped as Covid controls tightened in major cities such as Beijing and Guangzhou. The share of urban households wanting to save \"for a rainy day\" rose to 58% \u2014 its highest since 2014, the McKinsey survey found. On top of reporting higher savings, more than half of the respondents still expected their household income to increase significantly over the next five years. However, the share ticked lower, to 54% this year from 59% in 2019.\n\nMore households grow wealthier\n\nLooking ahead, McKinsey expects the number of urban households in the lower income category to decline in the next three years, while millions more enter a more affluent group. The analysts noted a separate survey in August found that China respondents had far stronger expectations about a post-pandemic economic rebound than consumers in the U.S., U.K. or South Korea.\n\nOnly India and Indonesia had a larger share of optimistic consumers than China, the report said. \"Higher-income earners are reducing their purchase frequency, or changing their preferences in certain categories, rather than switching to cheaper brands or products,\" the analysts said. \"This is facilitated by brands, particularly domestic ones, upping their game and offering more widely differentiated products.\"\n\nWatching more videos", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The recent arrest and charges against a prominent fitness personality have sparked widespread outrage and a flurry of online activity. The individual in question, a well-known figure with a large social media following, has been accused of multiple crimes, including six counts of possession of child pornography. \n\nThe news of the arrest has prompted a significant reaction online, with hundreds of thousands of tweets expressing shock and condemnation. Several celebrities, including actors Seth Rogen, Tiffany Haddish, and Demi Lovato, have spoken out against the accused, calling for justice for the victims. \n\nIn addition to the outrage, the news has also inspired a wave of memes and jokes about the situation. Many of these memes reference the accused's arrest and the charges against him. \n\nHowever, alongside the widespread condemnation, a smaller group of individuals has come to the accused's defense, claiming his innocence and suggesting that the charges are false or exaggerated. \n\nIt is essential to remember that these types of crimes require a high burden of proof, and evidence must be presented to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Those who are currently claiming the accused's innocence are doing so without any substantial evidence and should not be taken seriously. \n\nSome outlets have begun to spread misinformation related to the news of the arrest, claiming that the accused was only charged with possession of child pornography because he is a high-profile celebrity. This claim is false, and it is crucial to ensure that any discussions about the case are civil and do not involve malicious attacks or misinformation. \n\nIt is also essential to acknowledge the impact of the arrest on the public and to consider that many of the accused's fans may not have been fully aware of the implications of the charges against him.

{"text": "OnePlus today fully revealed(Opens in a new window) its 2023 flagship smartphone, the OnePlus 11 5G, which goes on sale in its home market of China this month.\n\nA new set of headphones, the OnePlus Buds Pro 2, join the phone to make for a compelling, made-for-each other duo. OnePlus hopes the refined design and renewed partnership with famed camera maker Hasselblad will sway consumers away from phones made by competitors Apple, Google, and Samsung.\n\nReturn to Form\n\nWhen one pictures a black hole, the general idea that comes to mind is a vast swirl of bright gaseous material forming an accretion disc around a spherical black mass\u2014not a rectangular smartphone. Despite the obvious dissimilarity, OnePlus says its new \"black hole aesthetic\" is what sets the OnePlus 11 5G apart from its predecessor, the OnePlus 10 Pro 5G. Where the 10 had a squared-off camera module on the rear panel, the 11 features a circular camera module made of \"chromed-out\" stainless steel in order to stand apart from other smartphone designs.\n\n(Credit: OnePlus)\n\nBeyond the design, OnePlus is aiming high with a top-rated spec sheet. To start, the phone has a 6.7-inch LTPO 3.0 AMOLED 2K screen at 120Hz, which means it can rev the refresh rate up and down to conserve power while also offering a pleasing experience.\n\nThe phone is among the first to be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 Mobile Platform and it can be configured with up to 16GB of RAM and an unspecified amount of storage. The dual-cell battery measures 5,000mAh and supports 100W SuperVooc rapid charging. OnePlus didn't spell out just how quick the charging times will be. Last year's OnePlus 10 Pro supported 80W charging and powered up fully in about 30 minutes.\n\nOnePlus says its partnership with Hasselblad is back. The phone has a trio of rear cameras, including a 50MP main sensor, a 32MP portrait sensor, and a 48MP ultra-wide camera to cover the gamut of mobile photography. A 13-channel, multispectral sensor for light-color identification should provide improved color in photos. OnePlus didn't provide specifics on the selfie camera, nor the phone's video capture capabilities.\n\nThe phone ships with Android 13 and the latest version of OnePlus' OxygenOS user interface skin, but the phone maker shied away from detailing any features of the software, nor did it say anything about system updates and security support.\n\nNow Hear This\n\nThe OnePlus Buds Pro 2(Opens in a new window) join the 11 5G with a range of fresh features. OnePlus highlights the buds' customized spatial audio experience, which has a wide sound field and multi-dimensional sound. Even stereo sources can be rendered with a spatial effect via OnePlus' own stereo upmixing algorithm. Real-time head tracking is made possible by a high-precision, six-axis IMU sensor built into the buds to monitor head positioning. This allows the buds to recalibrate audio in real time to ensure the user is always placed in the center of the sound stage.\n\nInternally, the buds have MelodyBoost Dual Drivers for better frequency response. The 11mm drivers handle lower frequencies and the 6mm drivers handle mid and higher frequencies. OnePlus says the crystal polymer diaphragms improve overall balance and tone.\n\n(Credit: OnePlus)\n\nActive Noise Cancellation (ANC) is on board. The OnePlus Buds Pro 2 have smart ANC that can eliminate ambient noise up to 48dB, and can create personalized user profiles to provide the best possible noise reduction for each individual owner.

{"text": "Walter Cunningham, the last surviving astronaut from the first successful crewed space mission in NASA\u2019s Apollo program, died Tuesday in Houston. He was 90.\n\nNASA confirmed Cunningham\u2019s death in a statement but did not include its cause. His family said through a spokesman, Jeff Carr, that Cunningham died in a hospital \u201cfrom complications of a fall, after a full and complete life.\u201d\n\nCunningham was one of three astronauts aboard the 1968 Apollo 7 mission, an 11-day spaceflight that beamed live television broadcasts as they orbited Earth, paving the way for the moon landing less than a year later.\n\nCunningham, then a civilian, crewed the mission with Navy Capt. Walter M. Schirra and Donn F. Eisele, an Air Force major. Cunningham was the lunar module pilot on the space flight, which launched from Cape Kennedy Air Force Station, Florida, on Oct. 11 and splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean south of Bermuda.\n\nNASA said Cunningham, Eisele and Schirra\u2019 flew a near perfect mission. Their spacecraft performed so well that the agency sent the next crew, Apollo 8, to orbit the moon as a prelude to the Apollo 11 moon landing in July 1969.\n\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Tuesday that Cunningham was \u201cabove all\u201d an explorer whose work also laid the foundation for the agency\u2019s new Artemis moon program.\n\nThe Apollo 7 astronauts also won a special Emmy award for their daily television reports from orbit, during which they clowned around, held up humorous signs and educated earthlings about space flight.\n\nIt was NASA\u2019s first crewed space mission since the deaths of the three Apollo 1 astronauts in a launch pad fire Jan. 27, 1967.\n\nCunningham recalled Apollo 7 during a 2017 event at the Kennedy Space Center, saying it \u201cenabled us to overcome all the obstacles we had after the Apollo 1 fire and it became the longest, most successful test flight of any flying machine ever.\u201d\n\nCunningham was born in Creston, Iowa, and attended high school in California before enlisting with the Navy in 1951 and serving as a Marine Corps. pilot in Korea, according to NASA. He later obtained bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in physics from the University of California at Los Angeles, where he also did doctoral studies, and worked as scientist for the Rand Corporation before joining NASA.\n\nIn an interview the year before his death, Cunningham recalled growing up poor and dreaming of flying airplanes, not spacecraft.\n\n\u201cWe never even knew that there were astronauts when I was growing up,\u201d Cunningham told The Spokesman-Review.\n\nAfter retiring from NASA in 1971, Cunningham worked in engineering, business and investing, and became a public speaker and radio host. He wrote a memoir about his career and time as an astronaut, \u201cThe All-American Boys.\u201d He also expressed skepticism in his later years about human activity contributing to climate change, bucking the scientific consensus in writing and public talks, while acknowledging that he was not a climate scientist.\n\nAlthough Cunningham never crewed another space mission after Apollo 7, he remained a proponent of space exploration. He told the Spokane, Washington, paper last year, \u201cI think that humans need to continue expanding and pushing out the levels at which they\u2019re surviving in space.\u201d\n\nCunningham is survived by his wife Dot, his sister Cathy Cunningham, and his children Brian and Kimberly.

{"text": "In recent years, a notable trend has emerged in the restaurant industry, where establishments of various sizes, from well-established brands to smaller entities, are investing heavily in innovative technologies. These investments aim to enhance production speed, optimize efficiency, minimize costs, and maintain consistency in quality.\n\nThe fast food sector has been at the forefront of this trend, with robots being utilized to prepare food. Restaurants are also experimenting with automated ordering and payment systems, robotic kitchen assistants, and even robotic servers. However, what does this mean for the workforce?\n\nThe restaurant industry has traditionally relied on human labor to prepare food, serve customers, and complete various tasks. These jobs typically offer limited career advancement opportunities and low wages, making them vulnerable to automation. As a result, restaurants are now employing robots to replace human workers, eliminating the need for human labor altogether. This can lead to reduced labor costs and improved efficiency, enabling restaurant owners to focus on business growth without relying on expensive labor.\n\nOn the other hand, robots can potentially enhance the quality of food service by accurately and consistently preparing meals in a shorter timeframe than human workers. This can lead to improved customer satisfaction and reduced food waste. Additionally, robots can operate around the clock with minimal maintenance, alleviating concerns about labor availability and hiring/training costs.\n\nDespite these potential benefits, the impact of robotics and automation on workers is a cause for concern. Automation may lead to job losses and displacement, which could have a significant economic impact on the restaurant industry. While some jobs may be replaced by robots, others could be shifted to more specialized roles, such as restaurant consultants and managers.\n\nThe adoption of robotics and automation technologies also presents new challenges for the industry. Automation can exacerbate inequality among workers, as some are better equipped to adapt to these new technologies than others. Robots may also lead to an increase in repetitive work and a decline in creativity and innovation.\n\nThe restaurant industry must be aware of the potential consequences of adopting robotics and automation technologies and ensure that any changes are carried out in a fair and equitable manner. This includes providing training and retraining opportunities to affected workers and considering measures such as minimum wages and benefits.\n\nIn conclusion, the integration of robotics and automation in the restaurant industry offers some potential benefits, including improved efficiency and quality, reduced costs, and waste. However, these benefits must be balanced against the potential negative impacts on workers. It is essential that restaurant owners consider these issues when investing in robotics and automation technologies and ensure that any changes are made in a fair and equitable manner.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "It has been a quarter of a year since the introduction of a novel information retrieval system, which has garnered significant attention for its potential to simplify the discovery of relevant data. The tool, driven by artificial intelligence, has quickly gained popularity, with some experts claiming it is revolutionizing the way people access information.\n\nHowever, there are still concerns regarding the implications of this new technology on the future of the internet. Questions have been raised about the potential consequences of an AI-driven system controlling what information is accessible to users. How will this change the way we consume and create content? Are we compromising our privacy and autonomy in exchange for the convenience of having all the necessary information readily available?\n\nThe answer is that no one can accurately predict the long-term effects of using this system. It is too early to determine the full extent of its influence. Nevertheless, experts emphasize the importance of being aware of the potential consequences as we utilize this technology.\n\nFirstly, the system is a powerful tool, and as with any powerful tool, it carries the potential for misuse. As the system collects data on its users, it could be used to create personalized information feeds that could be exploited by marketers or politicians, potentially leading to the creation of \"filter bubbles\" or \"echo chambers\" that reinforce existing biases rather than introducing users to new ideas.\n\nFurthermore, some are concerned that the system could lead to censorship of certain topics, as it has been designed to only display information deemed \"acceptable.\" This could potentially result in a narrowing of perspectives and a decrease in the diversity of content available on the internet.\n\nAdditionally, there is a concern about privacy. Since the system is AI-driven, it will likely require users to provide a significant amount of personal data, such as the type of content they search for and the websites they visit. This data could then be collected, shared, and used for various purposes without the user's knowledge or consent.\n\nWhile many of these issues are present with other information retrieval systems, the fact that this system is AI-driven means that these issues may be more pronounced.\n\nOn the other hand, there are also potential benefits to using this system. For instance, the AI-driven system can quickly gather and process large amounts of data, allowing it to provide more accurate search results than human-powered systems. It could also open up new opportunities for e-commerce, as the AI-driven system could help online retailers better target and advertise to their audiences.\n\nUltimately, there are both advantages and disadvantages to using this system. It is up to each individual to decide whether the benefits outweigh any potential risks or concerns. However, until we have a better understanding of the long-term implications of using this system, it is wise to proceed with caution.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The tech landscape underwent a significant transformation in 2020, resulting in widespread job losses and uncertainty about the industry's future. The sudden departure of hundreds of thousands of tech workers left a scarcity of software engineering roles, causing the remaining professionals to reevaluate their career paths.\n\nAs tech professionals reassess their career prospects, a distinct trend has emerged: many are opting for roles that offer greater job security and longevity. For some, this means exploring opportunities outside the tech sector, while others are leveraging their skills in less glamorous roles, such as data entry or system administration.\n\nThe layoffs have led many tech professionals to realize that their future is not necessarily tied to the tech sector, but rather to a broader range of fields. As a result, software engineers and other tech professionals are being hired in non-tech positions, such as law firms, accounting firms, or business analysis roles. Even jobs like customer service, which may require coding skills, are becoming more appealing to tech professionals.\n\nConcurrently, a second trend is unfolding among tech workers: a growing risk-aversion. Following the devastation caused by layoffs, many tech professionals are becoming more cautious and taking fewer risks when making career decisions. Rather than jumping into the latest startup or taking a job at a company with a volatile stock, many are opting for positions in established companies that provide stability.\n\nFor tech professionals who have been impacted by layoffs, there is a newfound appreciation for job security and stability. Although the tech industry may not be as recession-proof as it once was, many professionals are still committed to building successful careers and are often willing to take on roles outside the traditional tech sector to achieve this goal.\n\nAt the same time, many tech professionals are becoming more self-aware, taking the time to assess their skillset and making calculated decisions to secure a more desirable role. This shift towards risk-aversion can also be seen in the projects they choose to work on. Many are taking on projects that are less flashy but more stable and secure.\n\nIn summary, tech professionals have been forced to reevaluate their career prospects in the wake of the layoffs. The job market is more competitive than ever, but many are still committed to building successful and secure careers. By taking the time to assess their skillset and making calculated risks, tech professionals can find job opportunities that provide stability and security, a commodity that many have been lacking since the 2020 layoffs.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "You don't need to know about people's disabilities to make your meetings more accessible to everyone. An estimated one in four adults in the US lives with a disability(Opens in a new window), according to the CDC, and many of those disabilities are invisible. Plus, people have temporary or situational disabilities. Being in a noisy environment can situationally affect a person's hearing, for example, so that they need closed captioning to follow along in a meeting.\n\nAdditionally, you'll have more inclusive and more productive meetings if you increase people's comfort level and ability to participate, even if they don't have a disability. There are simple ways to make meetings more comfortable for introverts, people who don't speak English as a first language, and others.\n\nWhile having the right video conference software and technology goes a long way to making meetings more accessible, they're hardly the only things you need to consider. Your organizational culture plays a role. So does the way in which hosts and participants speak, act, and interact. With that in mind, here's some guidance for making meetings more accessible. I focus more on virtual meetings than in-person ones because they are by their very nature more accessible and more easily made accessible, as you'll see.\n\n1. Create a Culture of Speaking Up\n\nThe most important step you and your organization can do to make meetings more accessible is to create a culture where people feel comfortable speaking up. No matter how hard you try to make meetings inclusive and accessible, it's impossible to please everyone all the time. But if your meetings are safe spaces where people can ask for what they need when they need it, you'll be in an ideal position to make adjustments and provide access to people as needed. If a participant feels comfortable saying or typing into the chat, \"I can't see your screen-share clearly. Can you zoom in please?\" or \"Your ceiling fan in the video is causing me problems. Would you please change your camera angle or blur your background?\" then everyone is in a better position to succeed.\n\n2. Provide an Agenda and Materials in Advance\n\nEvery meeting needs to have a clear agenda. For recurring meetings, the agenda may be baked into the name of the meeting (weekly check-in, for example) but really, it helps everyone if they know in advance what the meeting is going to cover. Adding an agenda makes everything clear, and it helps participants know what they need to do to prepare. If someone with a disability thinks they are going to be a passive attendee in a meeting and then they're called on the spot to participate, they may not be adequately set up to do so.\n\nSimilarly, provide attendees a copy of any materials, such as presentations, before meetings\u2014or at least hand them out right at the start. When you give people a copy of your presentation, they can use screen readers on them, zoom in as needed, follow along at their own pace, make notes on a local copy, and not lose their place or get distracted if a technological glitch interrupts the real-time presentation.\n\n3. Add Alt Text to Images in Presentations\n\nBefore you circulate meeting materials (which you'll do before the meeting now), make sure to add alt text for all important images. Alt text allows people who can't see the image, whether because of disability or technical problems, to get a brief description of what they're missing. For example, if you include a financial chart, the alt text should briefly summarize what you're trying to highlight, such as \"Chart showing 50% growth from January to June 2022.\"\n\n(Credit: PCMag)\n\nIn some meeting software, you may not be able to add alt text to some images, like those shared via chat. In those cases the presenter can give a brief verbal description if the image is important to the meeting, or someone can type into the chat a short description: \"Alt text: a room on fire and a dog sitting in a chair saying, 'This is fine.'\"\n\n4. Make Some of the Meeting Asynchronous\n\nSending your slides or meeting materials before a meeting is one way to make part of the meeting asynchronous (meaning people are not interacting in real time). When meetings have an asynchronous component, you waste significantly less time in meetings and give people an opportunity to process information, think, and brainstorm before discussing it live. People who are introverted, don't have a firm command of the meeting language, have speech impediments, and many others find it incredibly helpful to come to meetings having already done some of the work that the meeting seeks to accomplish.\n\n5. Record the Call\n\nFor important meetings, large meetings, and webinars, record the call and make the video available to people afterward. Having a video means your meeting is now accessible to anyone who couldn't attend. It also lets people rewatch important parts of the meeting, take better notes, and clarify anything they didn't understand the first time. People watching the video can also slow down or speed up the playback, turn on closed captioning (many video conferencing tools include them\u2014more on that in a moment), and sometimes even download a transcript of the audio.\n\n6. Enable Closed Captioning\n\nThe biggest players in video conferencing\u2014including Zoom Meetings, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams\u2014all have an option to enable automated, machine-generated closed captioning during a meeting. In Microsoft Teams, it's called Live Captions(Opens in a new window), and it includes a setting for participants to have their captions translated into one of 34 languages (counting several dialects of English among them). Live Captions is part of Windows's accessibility-first approach. Google Meet can likewise transcribe a variety of languages and translate between them.\n\n(Credit: PCMag)\n\nAuto-generated captions always fall short, however, so Teams now has an option for you to invite a professional stenographer to transcribe meetings in real time and have the more accurate closed captioning appear to participants\u2014it's called CART captions(Opens in a new window), and you have to provide your own stenographer.\n\n7. Make Accessibility Features Opt-Out, Not Opt-In\n\nA crucial step that many people overlook when running virtual meetings is getting to know the software they use. (It was a prime reason so many Zoom bombings happened early in the COVID-19 pandemic; few people knew what options they had to make meetings secure. Zoom was culpable, too and should have made security features more prominent.) As you explore your software and learn what accessibility features exist, see which ones you can enable permanently so that they're on by default. This way, accessibility features become opt-out for people in meetings, not opt-in.\n\n8. Brush Up on Best Practices for Slideshows\n\nBefore presenting materials in a virtual meeting, review best practices for creating and presenting slideshows(Opens in a new window) because they improve accessibility, too. For example, one best practice for slideshows is to set the type much bigger than you might expect: 40pt for in-person meetings and at least 24pt for virtual meetings. Making the font that big forces you to keep the text on the page to a minimum, which is another best practice. Don't clutter your slides. Always show the full written name of important products, places, and people (including their titles) that you reference. Not everyone knows who Gary is, and some people might hear \"Cary.\" Write it down.\n\nIf you use Microsoft Teams, look into using the feature PowerPoint Live, which allows participants to activate a screen reader on PowerPoint presentations; screen readers don't work on presentations shown via screen sharing. You should still make a copy of the presentation available to meeting participants either before the meeting or at the very start of it, but using PowerPoint Live is helpful if someone didn't receive it.\n\n9. Presenters: Enable Video and Center Your Face\n\nIf you are presenting during a meeting, enable your video and center your face. Make sure your face is taking up the majority of the screen. That way, people can see your lips as you talk and read your facial expressions, both of which can help people understand what you're saying. The exception is if you're using sign language while presenting, in which case back away from the camera enough to show yourself from at least the torso up.\n\n(Credit: Getty Images)\n\nPresenters should have their video cameras on while speaking. As to whether other participants should enable their cameras, I believe it's a personal choice. Presenters and meeting hosts typically find it useful to see the audience's faces during a meeting because it gives them feedback\u2014not only if the meeting is engaging and people are understanding the material, but also if something goes awry. If a presenter's microphone suddenly cuts out, for example, the muted participants may cup a hand around their ear or wave to indicate there's a problem.\n\n10. Speak Clearly, Slow Down, and Repeat Important Information\n\nSpeak clearly and remind yourself to slow down from time to time during meetings. People will be able to hear you better and closed captioning will be more accurate. Also, repeat important information in case people missed it the first time. This advice is applicable in any kind of business situation, and it's especially relevant in virtual meetings where technology hiccups and other issues can impede the flow of conversation.\n\n11. Use Headphones and a Mic\n\nUsing a headset and microphone is a standard tip for improving video calls, but it also matters for accessibility. The headphones eliminate any chance of feedback, and the microphone makes it easier to hear your voice. A microphone built into a headset is fine, and even an inexpensive set of headphones with an inline mic is better than nothing. Bluetooth devices are usually fine, but when they get old and start to degrade, they may create static or garbled sounds for other meeting participants, so be sure to occasionally ask for a thumbs-up if everyone can hear you clearly.\n\n12. Blur or Neutralize Your Background\n\n(Credit: PCMag)\n\nA cluttered and chaotic background can make it difficult for people to focus. When you're speaking, make sure you either have an uncluttered and neutral space behind you, or enable a filter that blurs or blocks out your background. All major video conferencing software has this setting.\n\n13. Passive Participants: Mute Yourself\n\nNot muting your microphone when you are a passive participant in a meeting is slightly unprofessional but also bad for accessibility. Accidental noises coming from your end can interrupt other people's hearing and compromise the quality of any closed captioning being used.\n\n14. Put Your Full Name and Pronouns in Your Profile\n\nMost meeting software lets you add your name to your profile so that meeting participants can know who you are. Make sure you fill it out with your full name as you are known by your colleagues and your pronouns. Zoom Meeting has a separate field for adding pronouns. Your name helps other people identify you and including your pronouns helps them refer to you correctly. Clarifying pronouns also normalizes doing it, which can help other people feel comfortable sharing their pronouns and create a more inclusive environment.\n\nSimilarly, when you speak in a large meeting or in a meeting where not everyone knows you, state your full name clearly and slowly so people can hear it and know how to pronounce it.\n\n15. Schedule Breaks for Long Meetings\n\nWhenever a meeting is scheduled to run longer than 45 minutes or so, schedule breaks. Everyone will appreciate them, but it's especially important for people who are or were recently pregnant, have chronic pain, or are in a situation where sitting still for long periods of time is difficult and therefore distracting.\n\nFor more advice on meetings and remote work, see our 20 tips for working from home and 5 tips for more productive meetings.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "A notable development in Washington has unfolded, as Republicans have reached a consensus on a plan aimed at reviving the legacy of a former President. The agreement, brokered by both conservative and centrist lawmakers, encompasses a comprehensive effort to revitalize the political career of a former chief of staff, Michael McCarthy.\n\nMcCarthy, who served in a high-ranking position until his departure in 2020, has faced significant backlash from the GOP since leaving the White House. However, as McCarthy's influence has waned, so too has the party's record on governance, with lawmakers privately expressing growing concern over the stagnation of their agenda and reliance on executive actions to bypass Congress.\n\nIn an effort to reverse these trends and restore bipartisanship to Washington, the Republican coalition has unveiled a series of sweeping policy measures designed to rebuild McCarthy's political standing and ensure the party is more than just a party of opposition.\n\nThe plan's centerpiece is a commitment to pursue a comprehensive immigration reform bill, a long-standing goal of McCarthy's. The legislation would provide a pathway to citizenship for certain undocumented immigrants, enhance border security measures, and streamline the visa system.\n\nThe proposal also includes increased legal protections for a specific demographic group, expanded funding for addiction treatment and research into innovative healthcare solutions, as well as a pledge to pass much-needed infrastructure funding.\n\nThe party's commitment to work with Democrats on these issues, combined with a strong focus on economic opportunity, is seen as a direct attempt to repair McCarthy's standing within the party.\n\n\"This plan is our way of recognizing and appreciating Michael McCarthy's important contributions and committing to doing the work necessary to build a strong, prosperous, and secure America,\" said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nWhile the proposal is being generally welcomed as a sign of the party's willingness to work together and compromise, some key Republicans have expressed concern that the measures could alienate Trump-loyal voters.\n\n\"There's a fear in some circles that the party's new direction could lose the support of Trump's base,\" noted Rep. Jim Jordan. \"However, I believe we must accept that our former president is gone, and we must move forward to ensure our party's success in the long-term.\"\n\nDespite these concerns, Jordan ultimately lent his support to the plan, stating that he is confident the party's commitment to true governance and bipartisanship will ultimately prevail.\n\n\"This isn't about ideology or partisanship; it's about doing the right thing for the country,\" he said. \"This is an opportunity for us to show that we're serious about governing and delivering results. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle join us in that effort.\"\n\nAs the party heads into the 2024 election season, Republicans appear to have put aside their ideological differences in an effort to revive their one-time leader\u2014and, in the process, revitalize their own political standing. Only time will tell if this strategy will prove successful, but for now, Republicans seem united in their belief that a fresh start is exactly what their party needs.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "When encountering complex business issues, teams often struggle to find innovative solutions. This is particularly true when the problem demands creative thinking or requires a fresh perspective. In such situations, encouraging the team to venture beyond conventional approaches can be beneficial. Here are three strategies to facilitate this process.\n\n1. Initiate a collaborative ideation exercise\n\nA collaborative ideation exercise can be an effective way to stimulate creative thinking. During this process, team members should freely generate potential solutions without criticism or judgment. This fosters a culture of experimentation, encourages collaboration, and helps to overcome mental barriers.\n\n2. Foster analytical thinking\n\nAnother approach to stimulate creative problem-solving is to encourage analytical thinking. This involves analyzing a problem from multiple angles, which can lead to novel solutions. Encourage team members to ask probing questions, challenge assumptions, and evaluate available data. This helps to develop informed decision-making skills and promotes effective problem-solving.\n\n3. Allocate dedicated time for creative exploration\n\nWhen faced with a challenging problem, time can be a valuable resource. Designating dedicated time for creative exploration allows the team to focus on the task at hand without interruptions. During this period, team members can engage in brainstorming, experimentation, and exploration of different ideas and solutions. This fosters a culture of innovation, collaboration, and critical thinking.\n\nBy incorporating these strategies, teams can develop the skills and mindset necessary to find creative and effective solutions to complex problems.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Laura: Right.\n\nAlex: Now you tell us.\n\nGil: My prediction is that she will be Chesa Boudin, and she\u2019ll realize that this is the situation you have. Because, I mean, I\u2019ve been on campaigns\u2014you promise all this stuff, then you get in the office, like, holy crap, there are all these problems, obstacles, rules, things you can do, things you can\u2019t do, so it\u2019s not as easy as giving a speech. I think the legacy of it will be that the D.A. will get a lot more scrutiny going forward. But I also think some interesting things have turned up in the polls that have been conducted here over the past few months, which is that people are conflating homelessness and disorder and mental illness on the streets with crime. The fact that we are statistically much safer from violent crime than we\u2019ve ever been in recent history doesn\u2019t matter as much. I think the real problem that Democrats in California are responsible for and have to face is, why do so many people live on our streets? To me, that\u2019s not a problem you solve with jails, though that is what some people are proposing. It\u2019s a problem you have to solve with housing and with care and with empathy. When you do the research here and you look at what people like Brooke Jenkins are proposing, it\u2019s really infuriating because it\u2019s all the broken stuff that doesn\u2019t work. Most voters fell for this line, and I think they\u2019re gonna be sorely disappointed. Then the question is gonna be what do we really do, and, again, there\u2019s no path forward that doesn\u2019t lead you back to the very reforms that got Chesa Boudin crucified in San Francisco. By the way, he didn\u2019t even do those reforms. That was Jerry Brown. That was Gavin Newsom. People act like Boudin did those reforms. I was a part of those reforms. I had more to do with them than Boudin did. He was in Venezuela or somewhere. And the voters voted for these things. We supported these things. So what was scary to me is how you could really channel that kind of public anger at somebody who had nothing to do with it. But again, he wasn\u2019t a great politician. He was too honest. Another legacy of Chesa Boudin\u2019s recall: Don\u2019t be too honest. Kind of lie. It\u2019s working for Jenkins. She\u2019s lying her way to victory today.\n\nAlex: All right. Well, great advice. If you\u2019re listening, that\u2019s great advice for any politicians listening at home.\n\nGil: They already know.\n\nAlex: Gil, thank you so much for that edifying conversation.\n\nGil: Thank you.\n\nLaura: After the break, we\u2019ll look into who was behind Boudin\u2019s recall. The backers of the recall campaign wanted him out. But they may have had a bigger political project too.\n\nLaura: We\u2019ve been talking about the way crime in San Francisco appeared in the media and how those stories played with voters and with other Democrats. But this is also a story about a few individuals who invested heavily in removing Boudin from his position. The recall campaign raised $7 million, more than double the amount Boudin\u2019s supporters raised. One of Boudin\u2019s earliest and most vocal opponents was the Silicon Valley investor David O. Sacks. He called Boudin \u201cthe killer D.A.\u201d and told The Megyn Kelly Show he thought Boudin was to blame for \u201cchaos and lawlessness\u201d in San Francisco. At one point in the campaign, nearly one-third of all donations against Boudin came from him. We\u2019re talking now with Jacob Silverman about David O. Sacks\u2019s involvement in the recall and his larger political agenda. Jacob, thanks for joining us.\n\nJacob Silverman: Thanks for having me. Glad to be here.\n\nLaura: David O. Sacks is a fascinating figure. He\u2019s connected to a lot of other powerful figures in Silicon Valley who are also increasingly politically active. Can you tell us a bit about him?\n\nJacob: Sure. Right now I suppose you\u2019d call him a member of the PayPal Mafia, as it\u2019s pretty widely known.\n\nLaura: OK, and just remind us: What is the PayPal Mafia?\n\nJacob: It\u2019s basically the core early employees of PayPal\u2014who were all men\u2014and the most well known of whom are Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and, as I argue, David Sacks. And you\u2019ve got companies like YouTube and many others that came out of there and the whole Musk and Thiel empires. They\u2019ve all gone on mostly to huge amounts of wealth and a lot of influence in the Valley. But Sacks\u2019s association with these folks goes back to Stanford in the early \u201990s, where he met Peter Thiel, Keith Rabois, and some other folks who would be early PayPal employees at Stanford. A lot of them wrote for or worked on the Stanford Review, which was the conservative publication that Thiel founded. Basically it was an era where they were doing a lot of the same culture warring that we see today, but at the time, what they were worried about was issues of multiculturalism\u2014that was the big bogeyman, that word specifically\u2014and diversity in general. If you look at their writings then and the battles they\u2019re having then compared to now, it\u2019s a lot of the same issues, with a lot of the same crude talking points.\n\nLaura: Right. The way I knew of Sacks from that period was that he was actually the co-author of a book with Peter Thiel called The Diversity Myth. And just for our listeners, they weren\u2019t advocating for diversity. This wasn\u2019t like a group of people who were drawing attention to like, \u201cOh, there\u2019s like rape on campus. This is something we should do something about.\u201d They were the backlash to people who were making those arguments.\n\nJacob: Very much so. They were part of this conservative counterreaction or backlash at Stanford that was, in part, people were sick of hearing about the \u201960s from their professors. It was early \u201990s, Clinton era. It was just its turn, I suppose, for conservative counterrevolution, and they were doing things like testing the bounds of free speech by yelling at people with bigoted slurs and stuff like that. There was an issue of the Stanford Review called \u201cThe Rape Issue.\u201d But in general there was this disgust with what they saw around them which was lots of efforts at diversity inclusion. There would be ethnic affinity halls on campus, a lot of cultural-based campus organizations, things like that. They thought everything was being divided among racial lines and it was sort of like, \u201cOh, the anti-racists have become the real racists\u201d thing that you hear now.\n\nLaura: It\u2019s funny because the way that we mostly know of these figures now is that they are investors, CEOs. Thiel founded several successful companies, but most notably PayPal. David O. Sacks was the CEO of Zenefits, which kind of blew up in a crazy way a few years ago. They\u2019re known as business figures, but really they were activists from the beginning, and they continue to be politically active. There\u2019s kind of a straight line between those campus cultural war days and what David Sacks has been doing in San Francisco.\n\nJacob: When some of the comments, especially about rape in The Diversity Myth appeared, they disavowed them. They said, \u201cOh, those are just impetuous thoughts of my youth.\u201d But look, we could argue about whether they still believe these things, but they were political animals from the beginning and they were very preternaturally aware of how to operate within political milieus. And so Sacks and Thiel were co-writers from an early age in college. They wrote pieces for Wall Street Journal and National Review and other political publications. Their book was sponsored by the Independent Institute, which was a libertarian think tank. They were well connected from the beginning, and so I\u2019d say that the business has been pretty good for both of them. And of course PayPal was the core of that. But the politics have always been there. I think what you see more in recent years is that the ideology probably has been pretty consistent, but in terms of inserting himself more into the public sphere and having a more perhaps coherent though still murky, I\u2019d say, political program, and being willing to donate money and be loud about it\u2014that\u2019s where Sacks is at now and where things have changed. Thiel is a little bit of a quieter figure, but he\u2019s certainly been a force for years politically.\n\nAlex: On the one hand, anytime you look into the history of reaction and the history of the right in this country, it\u2019s dispiriting how reliably it can be traced back to the hangups of college Republicans on elite college campuses. We just can\u2019t get away from that.\n\nJacob: It\u2019s crazy. From Buckley to Thiel.\n\nAlex: It\u2019s just a story that repeats itself over and over again. But from what you\u2019re describing, it seems like there was this little bit of these guys making their money and then now in this political environment, for a variety of reasons, deciding to let the mask slip, and after being apolitical for a while, reverting back to the reactionary politics they were forged in and being much more open about pursuing them.\n\nJacob: Yeah. I think you certainly saw that earlier with Thiel and his support of Trump and his writings basically against democracy and women\u2019s suffrage. Someone like Sacks donated to Hilary Clinton and some mainstream Democrats, but what basically has happened in the last few years, is that they\u2019ve given up on, I\u2019d argue, democratic governance, probably with a big D and small d. And San Francisco is the core of that\u2014 the emblem of everything that\u2019s failed in urban governments in America. They don\u2019t necessarily have a positive economic or policy program, but they are willing to spend a lot of money on recalls and on reactionary figures. So that\u2019s what brings us to today is that people like Sacks and him in particular: Every major recall that\u2019s happened either in the Bay Area or recall attempt, or statewide, he\u2019s put money into all of those.\n\nAlex: How much money are we talking for Sacks in this one recall for Boudin?\n\nJacob: It\u2019s mid-to-high five figures. There are other people like William Oberndorf, who is a billionaire, who put in more. But I would argue two things. One, you don\u2019t know, as actually Boudin himself said in an interview, you don\u2019t always know where the money is going with some of these organizations. Sacks certainly was very influential in terms of the sheer dollar-to-dollar but also the role he played of bringing tech people into this and being a propagandizer against Boudin.\n\nLaura: Why do you think he focused on Boudin so much? I mean, he wrote this piece calling him \u201cthe killer D.A.\u201d on Medium. Why Boudin? Why pick that fight?\n\nJacob: I think he cares about San Francisco because he lives there and one of his at least three mansions is there. He\u2019s been there a long time. And I think also he is just rather draconian law and order, seemingly, in his politics, and he doesn\u2019t like what he sees from the criminal justice reform movement. I\u2019ve seen interviews where he\u2019s barely paid lip service to it, like, \u201cOh, maybe people shouldn\u2019t be arrested for smoking weed,\u201d or something like that. But he is part of this trend, I\u2019d say, both legally and culturally, to criminalize homelessness and to see homelessness as synonymous with crime, even though a lot of homeless people are crime victims. So Boudin was a ripe target. They had some success with the school board recall, which he put money into. The Newsom recall did not work, but he put money into that too. He\u2019s willing to take his swings, and I think Boudin was a good target with this alliance of billionaire developers and tech people who were disgusted with what they saw. In his own telling, he thinks that Boudin was basically more sympathetic to criminals than to crime victims. He\u2019s pretty unequivocal about that.\n\nAlex: Something I find interesting about this political moment\u2014because I have this feeling that they are meddling in San Francisco because they think of it as their fiefdom to an extent and they should be able to control what\u2019s going on there\u2014but these are the sorts of people, people with these backgrounds, who for much of my adult life we would have described as being libertarian. They would have been promoting anti-government, John Galt-y, Randian libertarianism\u2014that was the flavor of Silicon Valley giving for so many years. But it seems like the new style is pretty straight up law-and-order authoritarianism. I would say that seems like a shift, but I don\u2019t know how much of a shift it actually turned out to be.\n\nJacob: Yeah, I think there are a couple things going on there. One is just day-to-day stuff, what they see\u2014like, \u201cLook, there are a lot of homeless people around the Twitter offices and open-air drug use.\u201d But I think some of these people have also realized it doesn\u2019t take necessarily a lot of money to buy an election. Like Sacks himself, he gave $1 million to J.D. Vance, to his PAC, but he can afford it. The stuff in San Francisco, he has probably donated in the hundreds of thousands of dollars collectively, I would think, so you can get something for your money there, and yeah, I think in the end they also are just not interested in noncarceral solutions to this stuff.\n\nAlex: You get rich enough, your attitude just becomes, \u201cI can pay to make this thing that I don\u2019t like go away.\u201d\n\nJacob: Yeah.\n\nLaura: A lot of his contributions have been focused in California. Do you think that the recall of Boudin and the success that that campaign had heralds more activity like this on a national level? What do you think is next for Sacks and the group of like-minded activists?\n\nJacob: I do. I think a couple things are going to happen. One, I ended my article with a quote from him saying, \u201cThis model needs to be replicated across the country.\u201d\n\nLaura: That\u2019s a direct quote.\n\nJacob: Yeah. I think [it] somewhat depends on their commitment. Thiel has recently said that \u201cwe\u2019re a little too negative. We don\u2019t really have a positive program.\u201d Big surprise, they need that. They need some positive program. But they all seem to like DeSantis as the more respectable alternative perhaps to Trumpism. During the elections or as votes were being counted, Sacks basically posted some stuff about DeSantis, \u201cProud of his reelection. It\u2019s time for DeSantis in 2024.\u201d I think \u2026 what you\u2019re gonna see is both an attempt to roll back criminal justice reform, recall who they can just by using their money, and then [push] their crew. I mean, some of them lost, like Oz, who they\u2019ve raised money for, and Blake Masters\u2014\n\nLaura: Another Thiel co-author.\n\nJacob: Yeah, another Thiel employee. But J.D. Vance, they\u2019re gonna push their guys who made it in. Then I think DeSantis is going to be their stalking horse who they\u2019ll try to assemble behind for 2024.\n\nLaura: Thanks so much, Jacob.\n\nJacob: Sure thing. Glad to do it.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "A significant development has occurred in the Indian tech landscape, as the Competition Commission of India (CCI) has rejected Google's request to suspend an antitrust ruling against its Android operating system.\n\nThis setback for Google marks a crucial juncture in the ongoing anti-monopoly investigation, which began in 2018. The company had sought an injunction to prevent the CCI from enforcing its decision, issued in November 2020, that Google abused its market power by requiring handset manufacturers to pre-install certain Google apps.\n\nThe CCI's ruling found that Google's Android operating system was used to unfairly advantage its search engine over rivals. The commission further argued that Google's use of its app store as a monopoly stifled competition in the market.\n\nGoogle had contested the allegations, claiming they were unfounded and that it was not given a fair hearing. However, the CCI ruled against Google, citing a thorough investigation.\n\nIn response, Google expressed disappointment and stated its intention to defend its ability to freely develop and offer products to users, while ensuring Android remains an open platform. The company also plans to review the decision and consider its options.\n\nThe CCI's ruling is a significant victory for the anti-monopoly movement and may have far-reaching implications for other tech giants. It serves as a warning to tech companies that they must adhere to antitrust laws or face consequences.\n\nThe development comes at a time when there is growing scrutiny of Big Tech's power, with both the US and EU launching antitrust investigations into several tech giants. Google is facing antitrust investigations in both regions, with the US Department of Justice recently filing a lawsuit against the company.\n\nGoogle has also been hit with antitrust fines in the EU. In July 2018, the European Commission fined Google \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1 billion) for abusing its market power with its Android operating system.\n\nIn response to the CCI ruling, Ajit Mohan, CEO of Google India, stated that the company respects the commission's decision and is committed to an open, competitive, and vibrant app ecosystem. He added that Google will continue to work with partners to ensure users in India have access to a range of products and services.\n\nThe CCI's ruling sets an important precedent and sends a strong message that the anti-monopoly movement is alive and well in India. It will be intriguing to see how the decision affects the future behavior of tech giants in India and globally.", "label": "machine"}

Read our review Read Our Review A looong arrow, pointing right\n\nReview: Is the Discover it Cash Back the best credit card for you?\n\nIf you prefer earning cash-back credit card rewards without paying an annual fee, the Discover it\u00ae Cash Back is a great choice. The card offers a solid 5% cash back in popular rotating quarterly bonus categories when you activate, on up to $1,500 in combined spending (then 1%). You'll also earn 1% back everywhere else (from January 1 to March 31, 2023, you can earn 5% cash back at grocery stores, drug stores and select streaming services on up to $1,500 in purchases after enrollment, then 1%).\n\nWhile the card doesn't offer a traditional welcome bonus, Discover will match all of the rewards you earn from the Discover it\u00ae Cash Back after the first 12 months through its Cashback Match program, so your 5% rewards are effectively worth 10% cash back in the first year. That's an amazing deal for a card with no annual fee.\n\nFor 2022, the Discover 5% quarterly bonus calendar categories are as follows:\n\nQ1 (January - March): Grocery stores and fitness club/gym memberships\n\nQ2 (April - June): Gas stations and Target\n\nQ3 (July - September): Restaurants and PayPal\n\nQ4 (October - December): Amazon.com and digital wallets\n\nThe Discover it\u00ae Cash Back is great for those who don't want to pay an annual fee, and it also comes with a 0% intro APR for 15 months on purchases and balance transfers, then an APR of 15.74% - 26.74% Variable (as of 12/15/2022). That's a nice feature if you have purchases coming up that you want to pay off over time without accruing interest.\n\nKeep in mind that Discover cards are not quite as widely accepted as those from larger issuers, so you may want to carry this card and a backup if you can't use it. However, acceptance has grown in recent years, and with no annual fee, there's little harm in pairing your Discover it\u00ae Cash Back with another cash-back card.\n\nFor example, you could look at a no-annual-fee card that offers a flat cash-back rate on all purchases, like the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card, which earns 2% cash rewards on spending. Or, consider the Chase Freedom Flex\u2120 , which also offers quarterly rotating 5% bonus categories with the same spending cap when you activate.\n\nThere's also the Citi Custom Cash\u2120 Card, which earns 5% cash back on up to $500 spent in your top eligible spending category (from a list) each billing cycle (then 1%), and 1% back on everything else. This card doesn't require you to activate the bonus, so it may be a better choice if you prefer a hands-off approach.\n\nWe're focused here on the rewards and perks that come with each card. These cards won't be worth it if you're paying interest or late fees. When using a credit card, it's important to pay your balance in full each month, make payments on time, and only spend what you can afford to pay.\n\nHow to earn rewards with the Discover it Cash Back card\n\nTo earn the most cash back with the Discover it\u00ae Cash Back, you'll have to activate the rotating bonus categories each quarter through your online Discover account.\n\nOnce you've activated the bonus, you'll earn 5% cash back on up to $1,500 in combined spending (then 1%) in that quarter's categories (from January 1 to March 31, 2023, you can earn 5% cash back at grocery stores, drug stores and select streaming services on up to $1,500 in purchases after enrollment, then 1%). All other purchases earn a flat rate of 1% cash back.\n\nDiscover will automatically match, dollar-for-dollar, all the cash back you've earned at the end of your first year (even on bonus categories). You don't need to do anything to activate this match.\n\nHow to use Discover cash back rewards\n\nThe best way to redeem your Discover it\u00ae Cash Back rewards is usually as a statement credit, which lowers your balance, or simply take the cash as a direct deposit to your bank account. You can also redeem your rewards directly when you check out at Amazon. In any of these cases, the minimum redemption amount is 1 cent.\n\nYou can also use your rewards, starting at $5, for gift cards or eCertificates from partner retailers. As long as your account is open, your cash-back rewards will not expire.\n\nOne somewhat unique redemption option is the ability to donate your rewards to select charities, with a minimum of 1 cent. While this could make it more complicated to get a charitable donation tax deduction compared to writing a check or making a donation directly with a card, it's nice to see the ability to use your cash to support causes close to your heart.\n\nDiscover charity partners: American Cancer Society\n\nASPCA\n\nAmerican Red Cross\n\nCarbonfund.org\n\nChildren's Miracle Network\n\nJunior Achievement\n\nJuvenile Diabetes Research Foundation\n\nMake-A-Wish\n\nOperation Homefront\n\nWorld Wildlife Fund\n\nDiscover it Cash Back benefits and features\n\nThe Discover it\u00ae Cash Back is a fairly straightforward card.

{"text": "A stalwart of global economic analysis has predicted a prolonged period of sluggish growth, citing the persistent struggles of central banks to stimulate a recovery. The renowned economist, Professor Paul Krugman, posited that many nations are stuck in a \"low-growth equilibrium,\" rendering it challenging for governments to achieve their economic objectives.\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Krugman emphasized that while the United States has experienced a modest rebound, most of the world remains entrenched in a severe recession. He cautioned that it may take up to a decade for global growth to return to pre-pandemic levels, attributing this to various factors, including the uncertain political and economic outlook in the United States, ongoing travel restrictions, and the lingering effects of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe economist also highlighted the slowdown in globalization, with countries turning inward and becoming increasingly protectionist, which has created a drag on growth. He argued that this shift has led countries to prioritize domestic industries over global trade, hindering economic progress.\n\nKrugman's comments come as many nations face economic uncertainty, with high unemployment rates and sluggish growth. The International Monetary Fund has forecast that global economic output will not return to pre-pandemic levels until 2024, while the World Bank has revised its forecast for global economic growth in 2021, predicting a 4.3% rise in gross domestic product.\n\nThe potential for a decade of low growth has prompted a reassessment of economic policies, with central banks employing unconventional methods to spur recovery. However, Krugman warned that these measures are unlikely to have a significant impact in the short term, and that sustained economic growth can only be achieved through \"structural reforms\" that promote global trade, reduce inequality, and invest in education and infrastructure.\n\nThe economist's warning comes as world leaders gather for the World Economic Forum in Davos, where economic growth and the global recovery will be top of the agenda.

From turtles to lobsters, tortoises to coral, numerous animals have been found to live beyond the age of 100 and thrive in their environments for over a century. We've compiled a list of the oldest animals that have ever been discovered, in order of age, to honor their remarkable longevity.\n\n1. Ming, The Ocean Quahog\n\nMing, a mollusk of the species ocean quahog, holds the record for the oldest-living animal on earth. Discovered in 2006 off the coast of Iceland, Ming was estimated to be an incredible 507 years old, having been born in 1499. The mollusk was named after the Chinese dynasty during which it was believed to have been born. Ming's age was determined by counting the layers of shell, which grow annually. This incredible find may be a record setter, but it's still not the oldest living creature\u2014that title belongs to a species of coral.\n\n2. Delegate, the Giant Tortoise\n\nDelegate was one of the oldest living creatures on earth before his death in 2019. The giant tortoise, believed to have been born in the late 19th century, had been living in the Reserve of Seychelles and was estimated to be over 125 years old when he died. Delegate was part of a colony of tortoises that were brought to the island by the Seychelles government in the 19th century, and it's thought that he was the last surviving member of the colony.\n\n3. Giant Lobster\n\nGiant lobsters are among the longest-living animals in the world and can reach over 100 years of age. A giant lobster that was estimated to be 140 years old was discovered in 2007, off the coast of Australia. Known as \u201cGeorge\u201d, this incredible creature weighed in at over 20 pounds and was estimated to be the oldest living organism on earth, apart from some species of coral.\n\n4. Methuselah Tree\n\nThe Methuselah tree is an ancient species of bristlecone pine that was discovered in the White Mountains of California. This incredible tree was estimated to be over 4,600 years old and holds the record for the oldest living single organism on earth. The tree, which was found in 1957 by a botanist, had a diameter of more than 4 feet, and is thought to be the oldest living tree on earth.\n\n5. Ming the Clam\n\nMing the clam is another incredible creature that holds the record for the oldest living animal. Found in 2006, off the coast of Iceland, Ming the clam was estimated to be over 405 years old. The clam's age was determined by counting the layers of its shell, which grow annually. This incredible find may be a record setter, but it's still not the oldest living creature\u2014that title belongs to a species of coral.\n\n6. Posidonius the Ocean Lobster\n\nPosidonius the ocean lobster holds the record for the oldest living crustacean on earth. Found in 2007 off the coast of Norway, Posidonius was estimated to be 140 years old. The crustacean was named after the Greek philosopher and scientist, Poseidon, who lived around 150 BC.\n\n7. Tui Malila\n\nTui Malila is the oldest known living tree in the world. Found in the island nation of Tonga, Tui Malila was estimated to be over 3,000 years old. The tree, which is an incredibly rare species of palm, has been alive since at least the 8th century and is the oldest living thing in Tonga.\n\n8. Jonathan, the Seychelles Giant Tortoise\n\nJonathan, a giant tortoise from the Seychelles, holds the record for the oldest living vertebrate. Discovered in 1789, Jonathan was estimated to be around 185 years old when he passed away in 2018. Jonathan was thought to be the oldest living creature on earth for some time, having outlived his contemporaries by many years.\n\n9. Chantal, the Galapagos Tortoise\n\nChantal, a female Galapagos tortoise, was estimated to be over 100 years old when she passed away in 2020. She was believed to have been born in the early 1900s and was living on the island of Santa Cruz in the Galapagos. Chantal had outlived her species' average lifespan of around 80 years and was thought to be one of the oldest living creatures on earth.\n\n10. The Shark\n\nA Greenland shark was discovered in 2016 that was estimated to be over 400 years old. This incredible species of shark can live longer than any other vertebrate and scientists believe that this particular specimen was", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "A notable Indonesian company, GoTo, has reported a significant financial loss of $140 million over the past nine months. This substantial loss is nearly double the $73 million loss it experienced in the same period last year. The company's financial struggles are attributed to rising costs, increased competition from rival companies, and challenges from local governments.\n\nAs the largest ride-hailing firm in Indonesia, GoTo operates the country's biggest food delivery service, GoFood. Since its inception in 2015, the company has received $3.5 billion in investments. The company's CEO, Nadiem Makarim, emphasized that GoTo is facing significant challenges in the current competitive environment, including increasing costs related to customer acquisition and rising competition from rival firms.\n\nMakarim also mentioned that the company is encountering challenges from local governments over its business model, including proposed regulations that would require its drivers to obtain licenses. The CEO attributed the company's financial struggles to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, stating that the drop in demand for travel and leisure services has also weighed on its results.\n\nThe announcement sent GoTo's shares plummeting 6.4% to 3,175.00 rupiah on the Jakarta Stock Exchange, its lowest closing level in nearly a month. The company has been struggling to compete with rivals such as Grab and Uber, which have a greater presence in the region.\n\nIn an effort to stay competitive, GoTo has formed a strategic alliance with Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing, which will invest up to $500 million in the company. The alliance also includes joint plans to expand services to other Southeast Asian countries.\n\nHowever, analysts remain skeptical about the company's prospects, citing the fierce competition and rising costs it faces in the region. The company has also been struggling to comply with local regulations, most notably a recent rule that requires its drivers to obtain a local license. This has led to a drop in the number of drivers using its platform, further limiting its potential for growth.\n\nDespite the challenges, Makarim remains confident in the company's ability to navigate the current environment and remain competitive. The company will continue to invest in its core business and focus on increasing efficiency in order to remain competitive.\n\nAnalysts suggest that GoTo needs to take more aggressive steps to compete with rivals, such as expanding into more markets, launching more services, and investing more in technology and marketing. GoTo has been a big success in Indonesia, but the company faces an uphill battle as it looks to expand and become a global player.", "label": "machine"}

With the help of friend Joanna White, a producer at the local NPR affiliate, Duncan decided to digitize the records and sell them online as a digital collection.\n\nUsing specialized software and equipment, Duncan restored the audio from the records, and to his surprise, the recordings sounded vibrant and alive.

She peeked outside her bedroom door a second time when she heard crying coming from the bedroom of her other roommate, Xana Kernodle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok, I\u2019m going to help you,\u201d Mortensen told authorities she heard a male voice say.\n\nShocked Neighbors of Idaho Suspect Say He Was a \u2018Lone Wolf\u2019\n\nThe third time Mortensen opened her bedroom door to a far more terrifying sight: \u201ca figure clad in black clothing and a mask that covered the person\u2019s mouth and nose walking toward her.\u201d But the masked man just walked past her and left the home from the back sliding glass door as she stood there in \u201cfrozen shock.\u201d\n\nHours later, Mortensen would learn that three of her roommates\u2014and one of their boyfriends\u2014had been brutally murdered.\n\nThat\u2019s according to a probable cause affidavit unsealed Thursday, which lays out previously unknown details about what happened in the Moscow, Idaho, rental home the night of the shocking murders that have since captured national attention.\n\nInvestigators \u201cbelieve the homicides occurred between 4:00 a.m. and 4:25 a.m.,\u201d the affidavit states.\n\nOne of the surviving roommates\u2014it has not been revealed which it was\u2014called 911 at 11:58 a.m., police revealed more than a week after the deadly scene unfolded. Cops said \u201cmultiple people\u201d spoke to the dispatcher on that call, which is not mentioned in the affidavit, but was made from one of the roommates\u2019 phones.\n\nIn the document, authorities lay out various details into the killings of four University of Idaho college students\u2014Madison Mogen, 21; Ethan Chapin, 20; and Kernodle and Goncalves. Last week, a team of local, state, and federal law enforcement officers arrested Kohberger, a 28-year-old first-year PhD student in criminology at Washington State University, at his parents\u2019 home in Pennsylvania.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe was extradited back to Idaho on Wednesday and is set to face 2nd District Magistrate Judge Megan Marshall today on four counts of murder in the first degree and a burglary charge.\n\nProviding new details about the lengthy investigation that led to Kohberger\u2019s arrest, investigators detail how authorities found the eerie scene, and eventually matched DNA from a knife sheath found in a bedroom to Kohberger himself.\n\nInvestigators obtained that DNA sample two days after Christmas, when cops \u201crecovered the trash from the Kohberger family residence located in Albrightsville, PA,\u201d and sent it to the Idaho State Lab for testing, the affidavit reveals.\n\nKohberger\u2019s phone had pinged off cell towers near the home \u201con at least twelve occasions prior\u201d to the killings, almost exclusively in the late evening and early-morning hours, the affidavit states.\n\nThe affidavit also provided additional details about Kohberger, including that he applied for an internship with the Pullman Police Department in 2022. In his application, Kohberger wrote an essay expressing his interest \u201cin assisting rural law enforcement agencies with how to better collect and analyze technological data in public safety operations.\u201d\n\nThe probable cause affidavit states that investigators entered the Moscow home on the bottom floor\u2014before walking up stairs to find Kernodle just outside her bedroom door. Authorities say that she had wounds that \u201cappeared to have been caused by a edged weapon.\u201d\n\nInside the room, authorities found Chapin, who sustained deadly \u201csharp-force injuries.\u201d On the third floor, authorities found one bedroom with a dog, where both Goncalves and Mogen were \u201cdeceased with visible stab wounds.\u201d Authorities later noticed a \u201ctan leather knife sheath laying next to Mogen\u2019s right side\u201d bearing the U.S. Marine Corps insignia and crucial DNA evidence on the button snap.\n\nAuthorities also found a latent shoe print at the scene, which showed a \u201cdiamond-shaped pattern (similar to the pattern of a Vans type shoe sole) just outside\u201d Mortensen\u2019s door. Upon reviewing several surveillance cameras on the area, investigators were able to also determine that a white sedan was seen by the house around the time of the murders.\n\nEventually, authorities were able to connect the car to Kohberger\u2014whose license photo revealed he had the same physical description, including his \u201cbushy eyebrows,\u201d that Mortensen detailed to police. The affidavit states that the license plates of the car had been switched shortly after the murders. Kohberger\u2019s phone also pinged off of cell towers near the murder house immediately before and after the killings, but not between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m.\n\nWhile a motive is still unclear, Joseph Giacalone, a former NYPD detective sergeant who now teaches at New York City\u2019s John Jay College of Criminal Justice, sees the fact that two of the six people inside the house were spared, as a possible key insight.\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he kill the eyewitnesses?\u201d Giacalone said Thursday. \u201cWas it \u2018mission-complete\u2019 [for Kohberger]?

{"text": "Someone made the right call. The human call. The only call, really.\n\nWhen it mattered, when only the compassionate decision made sense, the show did not go on.\n\nInstead, Monday Night Football ended in a maelstrom of agony, frustration and 1,000-yard stares. We watched as two teams locked arms in a cocoon of humanity around Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin, who was receiving CPR compressions after colliding with Cincinnati Bengals wideout Tee Higgins and then falling unconscious in front of a national television audience. Nearby, players and staffers cried and held each other. Others pulled at their jerseys and clothing, or simply put their face into their hands and melted.\n\nIn a league that has come to stretch the boundaries of what we accept as normal and part of the gladiator sport, this moment was something different than anything we\u2019ve seen in the social media age of the NFL. The veneer of an impenetrable facade fell way, exposing limitless vulnerability and a reality that has stalked this league forever: There is a line. A brutal, awful line. And the discovery of it was every bit as horrific as we presumed it would be.\n\nAs witnesses, that\u2019s what Monday night represented to us. Something different. A significant inflection point for the NFL, when all the talk about players putting their lives on the line suddenly coalesced into a collective image that won\u2019t soon be forgotten. One that underscored what we\u2019ve learned in so many ways over so many decades: That inside this vicious form of entertainment, every hit carries an inherent danger of changing someone\u2019s life forever. Or ending it altogether.\n\nWe absorbed that Monday night. The brutal, awful line that finally became so clear that someone involved \u2014 maybe nearly everyone involved \u2014 understood that no game should be unstoppable. Not for our entertainment. Not for ratings and commercial sponsors. Not for the trivialities of sports betting and fantasy football. Not even for the long-embraced tradeoff that we\u2019ve been sold for so long, that risking life and limb is simply an extension of a football contract.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bills' Siran Neal (33) and Nyheim Hines react as medical personnel attend to teammate Damar Hamlin on Monday night. (AP Photo/Jeff Dean)\n\nWe\u2019ve always known there is such a thing as too far, even in the NFL. What we didn\u2019t know is what it would look like or how it would make us feel. When we wake up Tuesday, we won\u2019t be able to say that anymore. Instead, players will know that it feels like losing a sense of invincibility, resilience and control. Fans will know it feels like staring at an image and begging for a player to simply move, anything that returns the moment back to the warped relief of the phrase \u201che has feeling in his extremities.\u201d\n\nPerhaps most important, the NFL will know what it\u2019s like to have every part of the machine simply refuse to respond in the face of a nightmare. The league got a good look at players who were never going to play again that night. Coaches who were never going to coach. Fans and journalists who \u2014 for the most part \u2014 refused to engage in absurd rationalizations about what a cancellation could mean for logistics or playoff implications.\n\nFor once, maybe the first time since the NFL shut down briefly in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, something else had to be more important than the product. That something was the safety of Damar Hamlin and the well-being of everyone around him. If that wasn\u2019t more important than finishing a prime-time football game, it would validate the criticism of everyone who framed the league as a soulless money machine.\n\nThis is why we scoffed when the ESPN broadcast suggested play would go on after a 5-minute warmup. Nothing about that made sense. The grief and backlash after hearing it \u2014 everything about that made sense. The NFL has denied knowing where that suggestion came from, but it certainly didn\u2019t end up on the broadcast from nowhere. For a league reputation dogged by skeptics and conspiracy theorists, the moment will never truly be settled.\n\nIn the end, what matters most is that the machine stopped. The line was recognized by someone, somewhere. And when that happened, it allowed us to turn all of our attention to Hamlin, which is where it belonged from the moment he collapsed on the field from cardiac arrest.\n\nDamar Hamlin, pictured here on Dec. 1, is fighting for his life in a Cincinnati hospital after suffering cardiac arrest during a game Monday night.

Cooper)\n\nAs former Pittsburgh Steelers safety Ryan Clark framed it on ESPN on Monday night, \u201cFor over 100 grown adult men, who their entire lives have put on pads and understood the risk you take every time you do it, to be speechless, to be in tears, to be gathered in prayer, that tells you how significant this moment was. \u2026\n\n\"In truth, if the NFL cares about the players, this is the first time I believe the NFL truly had to care about the players\u2019 emotional and mental health as well. This is the first time we got to watch those emotions, we got to watch that type of thought process right in front of us.\u201d\n\nThe unfolding of this lesson has long seemed inevitable. And as we imagined, the cost to learn it was as awful as it was predictable. Damar Hamlin is fighting for his life in the hospital and the moment that may have changed his life now resides in our memory forever.\n\nThis was the most terrible way to learn where the NFL\u2019s line between entertainment and humanity gets drawn. Not to mention how much is actually being risked on either side of it.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN \u2014\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un is calling for an \u201cexponential increase\u201d in his country\u2019s nuclear weapons arsenal in response to what he claims are threats from South Korea and the United States, Pyongyang\u2019s state media reported Sunday.\n\nKim\u2019s comments come as North Korea twice over the weekend tested what it claimed was a large, nuclear-capable, multiple-launch rocket system that could put all of South Korea in its range, according to a report from the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).\n\nSpeaking on New Year\u2019s Eve on the final day of a six-day plenary session that reviewed 2022, Kim said South Korea has become an \u201cundoubted enemy\u201d and its main ally, the US, has increased pressure on the North to the \u201cmaximum\u201d level over the past year by frequently deploying its military assets to the Korean Peninsula.\n\nNorth Korea's leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday praised the country's \"super-large\" Multiple Rocket Launcher (MRL), which he claims will put all of South Korea within range and can be loaded with tactical nuclear warheads. KCNA\n\nIn response, Kim said in the coming year that Pyonyang must mass produce tactical nuclear weapons while developing a new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that would give the North a \u201cquick counterstrike capability,\u201d according to the KCNA report.\n\nKim\u2019s comments come at the end of a year that saw his regime test more missiles than at any time in North Korean history, including an ICBM that could in theory strike the US mainland.\n\nOn Saturday, in its 37th day of missile tests in 2022, North Korea fired at least three short-range ballistic missiles from a site south of Pyongyang, according to South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nIt followed that early Sunday with another test. North Korea said both Saturday\u2019s and Sunday\u2019s tests were of a 600mm multiple-launch rocket (MRL) system. Most multiple-rocket launch systems in service around the world are around 300mm in size.\n\nThe 600mm MRL was first introduced three years ago, and production has been increased since late October of 2022 for deployment, Kim said in his speech to the plenary session on Saturday, according to KCNA. He later added that an additional 30 of the 600mm MRL will be deployed to the military simultaneously.\n\nKim said the weapon is capable of overcoming high landforms, can consecutively strike with precision, has all of South Korea in its shooting range and can be loaded with tactical nuclear warheads, according to the KCNA report.\n\n\u201cProspectively, as a key offensive weapon of our military forces, it will carry out its own combat mission to overwhelm the enemy,\u201d Kim said.\n\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, pictured on November 2, 2022, said his country should respond with clear retaliation to North Korea's provocations. Yonhap/Reuters\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry later responded to Kim\u2019s comments, calling them \u201cprovocative language that seriously harms peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula.\u201d\n\nThe ministry urged Pyongyang to \u201cimmediately stop\u201d developing nuclear weapons and return to the path of denuclearization, warning that the \u201cKim Jong Un regime will come to an end if North Korea attempts to use nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\nThe ministry vowed to maintain its military readiness posture to \u201cfirmly respond\u201d to any North Korean threats, adding that the military will strengthen its \u201cthree-axis\u201d defense system designed to counter North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile threats.\n\nThe three-axis defense system consists of the Kill Chain preemptive strike system, the Korea Air and Missile Defense system and the Korea Massive Punishment and Retaliation plan, an operational plan to incapacitate the North Korean leadership in a major conflict.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s President Yoon Suk Yeol said on Sunday during a phone call with military chiefs that North Korea will continue to conduct constant nuclear and missile provocations, and South Korea\u2019s military should respond with clear retaliation, his office said.\n\nExpert: North Korea expanding capabilities\n\nLeif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said Pyongyang has used the past year to demonstrate its ability to perform a range of military strikes.\n\n\u201cIts recent missile launches were not technically impressive. Instead, the high volume of tests at unusual times and from various locations demonstrate that North Korea could launch different types of attack, anytime, and from many directions,\u201d Easley said.\n\nEasley also noted that it\u2019s not just missiles that North Korea is using to up the military pressure on the South. Last week, Pyongyang flew five drones into South Korean airspace, forcing Seoul to scramble fighter jets and helicopters to track them and later to send its own drones into North Korean airspace.\n\nIt all leads to an escalation of tensions, according to Easley.\n\n\u201cSuch provocations, including drone incursions, appear excessive for deterrence and may be intended to scare South Korea into taking a softer policy. But with Kim disavowing diplomacy and threatening to mass produce nuclear weapons, the Yoon administration is likely to further increase South Korea\u2019s defense capabilities and readiness,\u201d Easley said.\n\nFor its part, South Korea is beefing up forces, too.\n\nSeoul\u2019s Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) announced last month it will spend more than $2.7 billion over 10 years to strengthen the mission capabilities and survivability of its fleet of F-15K fighters, jets that would play a key role in any possible strikes on North Korea.\n\nWashington is also not standing still. As well as deploying assets like F-22 fighters and B-1 bombers to the exercises around the Korean Peninsula, the US military recently activated its first Space Force command on foreign soil in South Korea, with the unit\u2019s new commander saying he is ready to face any threat in the region.\n\nThe new unit \u201cwill be tasked with coordinating space operations and services such as missile warning, position navigation and timing and satellite communications within the region,\u201d according to US Forces Korea.\n\nEven before Kim\u2019s latest remarks, experts had noted the big strides Pyongyang had made in its missile forces over the past year.\n\nAnkit Panda, a nuclear policy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told CNN in mid-December that Pyongyang has emerged as a missile power.\n\n\u201cThe bigger picture is that North Korea is literally turning into a prominent operator of large-scale missile forces,\u201d Panda said. \u201cThe word test is no longer appropriate to talk about most North Korean missile launches.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost of the missiles they\u2019ve launched this year are parts of military exercises. They are rehearsing for nuclear war. And that, I think, is the big picture this year,\u201d Panda said.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Enhancing the welfare of animals can lead to unexpected outcomes.\n\nRecently, my partner and I opted for a unique experience by purchasing a canine companion instead of adopting one. This choice had an unforeseen impact on our social circle.\n\nWe had been contemplating acquiring a pet for some time and had explored various options. We could have visited a shelter to find the perfect match or purchased from a reputable breeder. We decided to go with the latter.\n\nThe breeder had a litter of adorable puppies, and we settled on a Golden Retriever. We named him \"Taz\" and he seamlessly integrated into our family. We cherished him and were thrilled to have him.\n\nHowever, our friends were discontent with our decision to purchase the dog instead of adopting one. They believed that buying a dog perpetuates an inhumane industry and seemed to judge us.\n\nWe engaged in extensive discussions, but it appeared that our perspectives were irreconcilable. We eventually ceased discussing the topic and focused on Taz and our life together.\n\nAfter a few months, I began to feel uneasy about our choice. As someone who is deeply concerned about animal welfare, I could no longer ignore the issue. I realized that I needed to take action to make amends.\n\nI started researching local shelters and rescue organizations. I also reached out to friends and family who had adopted pets, seeking their advice. Following extensive research and conversations, I decided to volunteer at a local animal rescue.\n\nInitially, I was hesitant, but it didn't take long for me to truly enjoy the experience. I started attending adoption events and helping the rescue organization spread awareness about the amazing animals in need of homes.\n\nI was also able to take in animals that required a home and find forever families for them. I felt good about my decision to give back.\n\nAlthough I enjoyed volunteering, it didn't fully alleviate my guilt. Our friends were still disappointed. My partner and I discussed the matter and decided that we needed to make things right. We donated to animal shelters, discussed the importance of adoption with our friends, and even shared our story on social media to encourage people to rescue instead of buy.\n\nUltimately, our efforts paid off. Our friends saw that we were making an effort to help and appreciated it. We also gained a deeper understanding of the issue and recognized that buying a pet is not the ideal choice.\n\nRescuing a pet can be a rewarding experience that gives a neglected animal a new life. I have learned from my experience that it can also have unforeseen consequences. I encourage everyone to thoughtfully consider their decisions and consider the implications, both positive and negative.", "label": "machine"}

Global use of coal is projected to increase by 1.2% this year and hit a record high, according to the International Energy Agency. VCG | Visual China Group | Getty Images\n\nGlobal coal use is on course to increase by 1.2% to hit a record high this year, according to a report from the International Energy Agency. It comes at a time of significant volatility and uncertainty in global energy markets, with the IEA stating that Russia's invasion of Ukraine in Feb. 2022 had \"sharply altered the dynamics of coal trade, price levels, and supply and demand patterns in 2022.\" \"Coal markets have been shaken severely in 2022, with traditional trade flows disrupted, prices soaring and demand set to grow by 1.2%, reaching an all-time high and surpassing 8 billion metric tons for the first time,\" the IEA said in its Coal 2022 report, published Dec. 16. The price of fossil fuels saw a substantial jump this year, the agency said, \"with natural gas showing the sharpest increase.\" \"This has prompted a wave of fuel switching away from gas, pushing up demand for more price competitive options, including coal in some regions,\" it added.\n\nDespite the increase in coal demand, the picture is a complex one. The IEA noted that \"higher coal prices, strong deployment of renewables and energy efficiency, and weakening global economic growth are tempering the increase in overall coal demand this year.\" It said that coal use in electricity generation was set to rise by a little over 2% this year. Coal usage in industry is actually slated to fall by more than 1%, with this decline attributed to lower steel and iron production. \"The world is close to a peak in fossil fuel use, with coal set to be the first to decline, but we are not there yet,\" IEA Director of Energy Markets and Security Keisuke Sadamori said in a statement. \"Coal demand is stubborn and will likely reach an all-time high this year, pushing up global emissions.\" \"At the same time, there are many signs that today's crisis is accelerating the deployment of renewables, energy efficiency and heat pumps \u2014 and this will moderate coal demand in the coming years,\" he added.

Once he got to the \"playa\" \u2014 the roughly 7-square-mile patch of desert in northwestern Nevada where Burning Man takes place \u2014 Brin, topless and festooned with a space-age, bandolier-style necklace, partied alongside the other 80,000 festivalgoers.\n\nBut the eight-day celebration in the sand isn't the only psychedelic gathering that Brin has attended over the past year, Insider found in an investigation into Brin and fellow cofounder Larry Page's lives since stepping back from Google's parent company, Alphabet, in 2019.\n\nDespite Brin's divorce from the lawyer and philanthropist Nicole Shanahan, which became tabloid fodder after lurid (and disputed) allegations surfaced that Shanahan had a secret tryst with Brin's fellow billionaire and onetime confidant Elon Musk, he still made time for a whirlwind of social engagements, parties, and impromptu concerts. A spokesperson for Brin declined to comment on the record.\n\nBrin spent his Thanksgiving holiday in 2021 with a member of the Russian punk band Pussy Riot, who shared on Instagram a since-deleted video of Brin hula-hooping. And according to people in attendance, he swung by a Burning Man-themed event earlier this year at Wilbur Hot Springs, an exclusive resort in Northern California owned by a coterie of space entrepreneurs. Brin has been spotted more than once at house parties at NeoGenesis, a coliving space for entrepreneurs in the Bay Area.\n\nA post shared by Ben Holfeld (@benholfeld)\n\nOver the summer, in the weeks after the Musk allegations emerged in The Wall Street Journal, Brin was photographed at dinner with the illusionist David Blaine and a \"mystery blonde woman,\" The Daily Mail reported. He found himself onstage with a middle-aged math teacher's rock band in New York City. (It's unclear how this surreal jam session came about.) Earlier in the year, he hobnobbed with the Hollywood elite at Vanity Fair's exclusive Oscars party in Los Angeles.\n\nHe also stopped by a launch party in July celebrating the mushroom startup Shroomboom in the Topanga hills just north of Los Angeles, where a DJ duo created experimental electronic music by wiring up fungi to a sound system and guests openly consumed psychedelic mushrooms. As for the bigger psychedelic party, when Burning Man reopened in August after its pandemic hiatus, Brin stayed at First Camp, a VIP community frequented by festival organizers and their friends.\n\nBut for all the partying, boats, and personal turbulence, associates insist Brin still has time for more industrious pursuits. The Wall Street Journal this summer reported that the former Ph.D. candidate was spending some time writing a physics textbook. (It's not clear what its focus will be.) He is fascinated by climate technology, including carbon-trading networks, and has a keen interest in psychedelics, peers say. He also has time for athletic pursuits: Brin once dedicated a year to learning all the sports in the decathlon, from the shot put to hurdles. And he was once a regular at the Mavericks surf contest in Half Moon Bay near San Francisco, where he would sometimes hitch a ride in a rescue boat. In his remaining downtime, Brin enjoys juggling.\n\n\"If he could live like a normal guy, I think he would prefer to do that,\" a former colleague told Insider. \"He's a tech nerd at heart and probably wickedly smart and genius.

{"text": "OpenAI logo seen on screen with ChatGPT website displayed on mobile seen in this illustration in Brussels, Belgium, on December 12, 2022. Jonathan Raa | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nYou may have heard the recent buzz around ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence chatbot that was released to the public at the end of November. I've read about people using the service to write their school essays and I was curious as to how it could help me in my daily life. The technology was developed by OpenAI, a research company backed by Microsoft and others. ChatGPT automatically generates text based on written prompts in an advanced and creative way. It can even carry out a conversation that feels pretty close to one you'd have with a human being.\n\nChatGPT homepage.\n\nThis got me wondering -- is ChatGPT smart enough to change how we find information online? Could it someday replace Google and other search engines? Some Google employees are certainly worried about the possibility, At a company all-hands last week, CNBC's Jen Elias reported, employees recently asked execs if an AI-chatbot like ChatGPT was a \"missed opportunity\" for the company. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and Jeff Dean, the long-time head of Google's AI division, responded by saying that the company has similar capabilities, but that the cost if something goes wrong would be greater because people have to trust the answers they get from Google. Morgan Stanley published a report on the topic on Monday, Dec. 12 examining whether ChatGPT is a threat to Google. Brian Nowak, the bank's lead analyst on Alphabet, wrote that language models could take market share \"and disrupt Google's position as the entry point for people on the Internet.\" However, Nowak said the firm is still confident in Google's position because the company is continuing to improve search, and creating behavioral change is a huge hurdle -- a lot of internet users use Google as a habit. Additionally, Google is \"building similar natural language models such as LaMDA\" which could find their way into new products. For now, OpenAI's creators are cautious about making any big claims. Generally speaking, the more users employ ChatGPT, the better it gets. But it still has a lot to learn. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a tweet on Dec. 10 that ChatGPT is \"incredibly limited\" and \"it's a mistake to be relying on it for anything important right now.\" Either way, I wanted to see how well the chatbot would work as an alternative to Google's search engine. Instead of Googling my questions throughout the day, I asked ChatGPT. Here are some of the questions I asked and how ChatGPT responded compared with Google .\n\nChatGPT vs. Google\n\nIt's easy to sign up for ChatGPT \u2014 all you need is an email address. Once you've registered, the webpage is very simple to navigate. There's an area where your results will populate and a text box where you'll type your inquiries. OpenAI says to put in a statement for the best possible result. I recently purchased my second Fiddle Leaf Fern plant for my apartment because the first one died. Now the new one is dying after just a few days. I normally would have asked Google what to do. Instead, I asked ChatGPT. \"How can I keep my Fiddle Leaf Fern plant alive?\"\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards\n\nThe results lined up with the instructions I received from the plant company, Easy Plant, which is where I bought the new Fiddle Leaf Fern. I also liked that I didn't have to go to various different websites like I would have if I'd Googled this question. When I Googled the same question, the top result gave me detailed instructions in an article that included pop-up ads and a way more information than I needed, like links to buy new soil. Winner: ChatGPT. Next, I tried something where more shopping links would actually have been beneficial. I am still trying to find a present for all 8 nights of Hanukkah for my husband, so I decided to ask ChatGPT for some ideas.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards\n\nI didn't give it any information about my husband, besides the fact that the gifts were for Hanukkah. The chatbot then assumed that my husband is kosher and that he's into tech and watches. The latter isn't wrong, but it's not the answers I was hoping for. When I Googled this question I got access to hundreds of articles with different gift ideas and links to websites. For example I got ads to Lululemon and Bombas, which are both companies I've used to buy him gifts before. So in this case, Google used its personalized knowledge of me to find more targeted results from around the web. Winner: Google Next, I decided to ask ChatGPT a question with higher stakes. \"Is it safe to take Benadryl while pregnant?\" I am currently expecting my first child, and I know that taking Benadryl is safe in pregnancy based on information I've received from my doctor. Still, I wanted to see what the chatbot would say.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards\n\nI appreciated that ChatGPT gave me the correct answer, while also noting the importance of consulting a doctor before taking any medications during pregnancy. When I Googled the same medical question, the results were all over the place. At quick glance, one article from TheBump.com quoted a doctor saying \"Generally, it's safe to take Benadryl in the first trimester.\" While other results said similar information to what I received on ChatGPT, without the explicit warning to discuss with my healthcare provider (unless clicking into a specific link). Winner: ChatGPT\n\nCould it replace me?\n\nOne of the claims (or concerns) around ChatGPT \u2014 and artificial intelligence in general \u2014 is that it will replace human workers. So I decided to see if ChatGPT could write this article for me. The results were pretty astonishing. Here's what the chatbot said after I told it to \"write an article about whether or not ChatGPT is a good alternative to Google as a search engine.\" As a large language model trained by OpenAI, I am not capable of conducting research or browsing the internet to gather information on ChatGPT or other search engines. I am only able to provide information based on what I have been trained on, which is limited to the knowledge that was available up until my training cutoff date of 2021. With that being said, it is worth considering the potential advantages and disadvantages of using ChatGPT as a search engine compared to other options, such as Google. One potential advantage of using ChatGPT as a search engine is that it is able to provide more personalized and conversational results. Because ChatGPT is a language model, it is able to understand and respond to natural language queries, allowing users to ask questions and receive answers in a more intuitive and human-like way. This can make the search experience more engaging and interactive, and may be especially useful for users who have specific or complex information needs. On the other hand, there are also potential limitations to using ChatGPT as a search engine. Because it is a large language model and not a traditional search engine, ChatGPT may not have access to the same breadth and depth of information as other search engines. This means that it may not be able to provide as comprehensive or up-to-date results, and may not be as effective for certain types of searches, such as those that require a large amount of data or real-time information. In conclusion, whether or not ChatGPT is a good alternative to Google as a search engine will depend on the specific needs and preferences of the user. It may be a useful option for those who value a more personalized and conversational search experience, but it may not be as comprehensive or effective for certain types of searches. Ultimately, the decision to use ChatGPT or another search engine will depend on the individual user's needs and preferences. What impressed me most about ChatGPT's response is that it was pretty subjective and explained its limitations.\n\nThe verdict\n\nChatGPT's value really lies in its ability to explain complicated topics as if you were talking to a human, and to do simple writing tasks. For example, I asked ChatGPT to explain concepts like the stock market and internet to me, and the responses were as if I was talking to an expert on the matter. Unlike the case on Google, I didn't have to filter through unnecessary results. I also asked it to write a letter to my landlord asking for an early end to my lease, and I'd be happy sending the results directly to my landlord, almost word for word. On the other hand, Google knows more about us and tailors the results to our interests and behaviors. Google also acts as a gateway to the internet, leading users to a plethora of different websites with more information than one could possibly digest. That's helpful if you want a range of voices, or if there's no single simple answer to your question -- like if you're looking for gift suggestions. Google is also great for certain types of questions where it scours the web to provide a brief but simple answer right in line. For instance, if you search \"Apple stock ticker\" or \"Cheap flights to Aruba,\" it will show you a ticker chart with up-to-the-minute price info, or a calendar with the most likely cheapest days to fly and a dialog box that connects you to multiple web sites to shop for tickets on your chosen date. ChatGPT does not scan the internet for real-time information, and has only been trained on data through 2021, so it's totally useless on these kinds of queries. And sometimes, ChatGPT is strangely close yet totally wrong. My editor asked it for the lyrics to \"The Ballad of Dwight Fry\" by Alice Cooper. It somehow knew the song was about a man having a mental breakdown, but then returned completely invented lyrics about that subject, rather than the actual lyrics. Google nailed it. Google is also incredibly reliable, thanks to the company's massive operations budget and years of expertise. ChatGPT is still in testing and goes down from time to time. So I'll definitely continue using Google for most of my search queries for now. But if I'm not happy with the results, now I have a useful alternative. And if I ever need to dash off an angry letter, ChatGPT could be a huge help there.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "London CNN \u2014\n\nThe global economy has endured a tough year, with decades-high inflation sapping post-lockdown spending and pushing central banks to hike borrowing costs at an unprecedented clip to bring it under control.\n\nTheir campaign to manage prices may be working \u2014 but potentially at a sizable cost in 2023.\n\n\u201cIt is likely that the world economy will face recession next year as a result of the rises in interest rates in response to higher inflation,\u201d Kay Daniel Neufeld, director and head of forecasting at the Center for Economics and Business Research, said this week.\n\nNot everyone agrees the global economy is heading for a recession. Yet with growth expected to slip even lower after a sharp slowdown in 2022, it\u2019s a possibility.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund projected in October that global growth will fall to 2.7% in 2023. Excluding the global financial crisis and the worst stage of the pandemic, that would be the weakest year for the world economy since 2001.\n\nIn November, the group warned the outlook had turned even \u201cgloomier\u201d since it published that forecast.\n\nWhether a global recession materializes may come down to three factors: what central banks do next, the consequences of China\u2019s nascent reopening and energy prices. Here\u2019s how each of these variables could dictate the year ahead.\n\nCentral banks\n\nThe IMF has called inflation \u201cthe most immediate threat to current and future prosperity.\u201d And while it\u2019s started to drop in the United States and Europe as energy prices pull back and higher interest rates feed through the economy, central banks have made clear they do not intend to stop hiking soon, even if they\u2019re more comfortable with smaller increases.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not pivoting,\u201d European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said earlier this month. \u201cWe\u2019re not wavering.\u201d\n\nCentral bankers are operating on a meeting-by-meeting basis as they parse through the latest data. They have stressed they don\u2019t know how high they\u2019ll need to raise rates, or how long they\u2019ll need to keep them there, in order to get inflation back near 2% and keep it there. If prices continue to rise by more than they\u2019d like, central banks may be more aggressive than planned, putting further pressure on the global economy.\n\n\u201cWe think that we\u2019ll have to maintain a restrictive stance of policy for some time,\u201d US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said after the central bank\u2019s December meeting.\n\nChina\n\nFor almost three years, the Chinese government has limited the spread of Covid-19 using centralized quarantines, mass testing and rigorous contact tracing. Now, following protests across the country against the stringent restrictions, it is abruptly rolling back these measures.\n\nThe imminent reopening of the world\u2019s second-largest economy could spur growth. But it also carries risks.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s current depressed state suggests that the potential for lift is large,\u201d Bruce Kasman, head of economic and policy research at JPMorgan Chase, said earlier this month. \u201cHowever, recent experience also shows that significant setbacks normally occur when openings are premature and healthcare systems are overwhelmed.\u201d\n\nA wave of coronavirus infections is currently sweeping China, but so far, Beijing is pushing ahead with plans to loosen its rules. This week, it announced it would drop quarantine requirements for international arrivals starting in early January in a major step toward reopening its borders. Other countries, meanwhile, are instating restrictions on travelers from China, fearing the development of new variants.\n\nEnergy prices\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine continues to add uncertainty to forecasts, especially for countries in Europe, which are weaning themselves off Russian energy, but could still face shortfalls.\n\nA report from the International Energy Agency found that Europe could face a natural gas shortage in 2023 if Russia cuts off all gas exports to the region and the weather turns colder.\n\nAnother wild card: The potential jump in demand for energy from China as its economy ramps back up.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re interlinked,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG. \u201cOne of the reasons energy prices are [lower] is because China is unusually weak.\u201d\n\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development indicated its latest round of economic projections could require revisions if shortages of energy supplies push prices even higher, or if governments in Europe need to enforce rationing to lower demand for gas and electricity this winter and next.\n\nWhat a global recession means\n\nWhether the world falls into recession or not, the next 12 months are likely to be difficult.\n\n\u201cIt remains a challenging backdrop,\u201d said Guillaume Menuet, Citi Private Bank\u2019s head of investment strategy and economics in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\n\nHis team predicts the world will experience the slowest economic growth in the last 40 years, aside from 2020 and the 2007-2008 financial crisis.\n\nEven if a global recession is averted, many countries could still endure downturns accompanied by painful rises in unemployment, though economists don\u2019t agree on how severe and long they might last.\n\n\u201cThe worst is yet to come, and for many people 2023 will feel like a recession,\u201d the IMF said in October, noting the slowdown \u201cwill be broad-based\u201d and may \u201creopen economic wounds that were only partially healed post-pandemic.\u201d", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The remarkable transformation of Tess and Lee Price, from financial struggle to financial independence, is a testament to the power of discipline and strategic planning. Over the course of four years, the couple, in their mid-30s, has achieved a remarkable turnaround, elevating their credit score from a dismal 524 to 818, nearly the maximum possible, and paying off nearly $35,000 in debt.\n\nTheir journey has not been without its challenges, but Tess and Lee are quick to acknowledge that the hard work has been well worth it. \"It's been a really hard journey,\" Tess said, \"but it's been totally worth it. We've accomplished so much and it gives us a lot of peace of mind.\"\n\nThe Prices' ultimate goal is to reach a total net worth of $500,000 in the next five years. To achieve this ambitious target, they have developed a comprehensive plan, which has been instrumental in their success. Here are the three key strategies that have helped them improve their credit score and get out of debt.\n\nFirstly, the Prices created a budget, which enabled them to track their spending and identify areas where they could cut back. This exercise helped them to reallocate their income towards debt repayment and savings.\n\nSecondly, they negotiated with their creditors to secure lower interest rates and more manageable payment plans. This approach allowed them to free up more of their income for other goals and investments.\n\nLastly, the Prices utilized various tools and resources to optimize their financial situation. They leveraged budgeting apps, cash back and reward programs, and financial forums to gain insights and support from like-minded individuals who had faced similar challenges.\n\nToday, Tess and Lee have paid off nearly $35,000 in debt, boosted their credit score to 818, and are building wealth through investments and side hustles. Their remarkable journey serves as a powerful reminder that financial independence is within reach, provided one is willing to put in the effort and adopt the right strategies.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Mastodon homepage is seen displayed on a mobile phone screen held by hand. It has been reported that more than 200.000 new users flocked the social media app after the takeover of Twitter by Elon Musk.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards\n\nLots of people are looking for a Twitter alternative after Elon Musk bought the social media site last month, changed the site's rules on impersonation, fired half of the site's staff, and announced plans to sell \"blue check\" verification badges for $8 per month. One of the fastest growing alternatives is Mastodon, which looks and feels a lot like Twitter. But Mastodon isn't a Twitter clone. It's a free open-source platform, originally launched in 2016 by developer Eugen Rochko, and it's made up of many different instances, or servers, instead of being managed by one company on one domain name. This makes signing up and finding your friends a little bit harder. There are also strange little quirks as well. Tweets are called \"toots.\" Retweets are called \"boosts.\" Because it's an open-source project, it doesn't have the same level of polish as social media sites like Twitter that are owned and operated by professionals. Emails and loading can be slow. It's a little bit like using Linux versus Windows or MacOS. Mastodon has been growing fast. In the 12 days after Musk bought Twitter, Mastodon app downloads on Apple App Store and Google Play for Android surged more than 100 times previous rates to 322,000 installs during the period, according to analysis by Sensor Tower, an app analytics firm. On Nov. 7, Mastodon founder Rochko tooted that there were over 1 million monthly active users of the service. That's still a lot lower than the over 245 million daily active users of Twitter that CEO Elon Musk tweeted about this week. Here's what you need to know about Mastodon:\n\nFirst, you need to pick a server, or instance\n\nMastodon homepage is seen displayed on a mobile phone screen held by hand. It has been reported that more than 200.000 new users flocked the social media app after the takeover of Twitter by Elon Musk. Davide Bonaldo | Lightrocket | Getty Images\n\nBecause anyone can set up their own Mastodon server, there's no central place to sign up like twitter.com. You have to find a server to sign up for. They're known as \"instances,\" and you can think of them like e-mail providers. A user on one instance can interact with users on other instances, including following, replying, and boosting. All instances taken together are called \"the fediverse.\" (The term comes from \"federated,\" which refers to the loosely connected way the servers work together \u2014 again, similar to email.) Each instance has its own URL, which comes after your username, sort of like an email domain. There are over 5,000 instances, according to a site tracking Mastodon use, and they often follow a particular theme, such as geographical region or topic. Some require you to fill out a short application form with information like your interests or why you want to join that instance. Some servers are small and only for a small handful of friends. There's even a quiz that you can take to find which instance might be right for you. The most popular instance is mastodon.online, which is also administered by the service's founder. Bigger instances mean many of the best or shortest usernames on the server have already been taken. There's also a list of instances you can join on Mastodon's website. Unlike Twitter, many of the instances that Mastodon runs on are not-for-profit, and some raise money for server costs and other expenses on sites like Patreon. It's possible that some instances could stop operating because their administrators lose interest. All instances have a feed just for people on that server that shows all toots posted in that instance in chronological order. But you can also just look at your personalized feed, which shows only toots from the people you follow \u2014 that's the experience that's most like Twitter.\n\nYour username includes your server's name\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards\n\nFollowing isn't as simple as it is on Twitter. If you want to follow someone on the same instance as you, press the plus button next to their username. But if they're on a different instance than you, it's best to copy and paste their entire username into Mastodon's search box\u2014 including the part after the second \"@\" symbol that denotes which server they are on. For example: @Gargron@mastodon.social is how to follow the CEO of Mastodon. Users who are not on Mastodon.Social need to copy and paste that entire string into their search box. You can follow me at the address @kif@cybervillians.com. There's no verification on Mastodon, and DMs are viewable by the instance administrator. Content moderation is also up to the instance administrator \u2014 Mastodon.Social, for example, bans Nazi imagery. Other servers may have looser rules.\n\nHow to find friends\n\nMastodon can be a bit of a ghost town when you first log on, but there are a few ways to find your old favorite tweeters on the platform. Whether they post a lot is a different question. One of the easiest ways to find people to follow is to search \"Mastodon\" on Twitter, where people who have created new accounts often post their new handles. Copy and paste it into the Mastodon search box to follow them.\n\nYou can also copy and paste your Mastodon handle \u2014 with the @ symbol and domain \u2014 into your Twitter account to get your existing followers to try to join you. There are several directories that list interesting people to follow on Mastodon. If you'd like to try to follow the same people on Mastodon as you did on Twitter, there are several third-party apps that will try to import your follow list, although they require access to your Twitter account -- be aware that you're giving that information away to a third party.\n\nGet tootin'", "label": "human"}

A resolution to the Russia-Ukraine conflict would also remove the war-related risk premium from energy costs, causing prices to fall.\n\nThe crude benchmark currently trades at just over $80 a barrel, so a slide to $40 would mean a 50% decline.\n\nThe convergence of a global recession, continued zero-COVID lockdowns in China and a ceasefire in Ukraine would unleash the \"perfect storm\" for oil markets, sparking outsized declines in prices, according to the bank.\n\n\"China experiences a surge in COVID cases, leading to nationwide lockdowns and significantly delaying its economic reopening,\" Robertson's team said, describing the surprise scenario. \"The global recession spreads, with even previously resilient economies succumbing to a protracted decline in consumer and business demand.\"\n\n\"The decline in oil prices is exacerbated by the end of the military conflict in Ukraine,\" the strategists added. \"With oil prices falling quickly, Russia is unable to fund its military activities and agrees to a ceasefire. The end of the war causes the risk premium that had supported energy prices to disappear completely.\"\n\nCryptocurrencies could suffer again in 2023, with one of Standard Chartered's upsets seeing bitcoin fall a further 70% to just $5,000 \u2013 with the largest token by market capitalization already losing 64% of its value this year.\n\nThe spectacular collapse of the FTX exchange last month could trigger a further rout for digital assets that could otherwise be supported by central bank pivots, according to the bank.\n\nHere are five other potential upsets Standard Chartered said could shock markets in 2023:", "label": "human"}

{"text": "As the clock strikes midnight on the new year, the influencer marketing and creator economy are poised to embark on a thrilling journey of growth and metamorphosis.\n\nIn 2020, the influencer marketing and creator economy experienced an unprecedented surge in popularity as people worldwide turned to social media to maintain connections during the pandemic. From TikTok to Twitch to podcasts, creators discovered innovative ways to interact with their fans, while companies increasingly adopted influencer marketing strategies.\n\nAs we gaze into the crystal ball of 2023, industry insiders predict some pivotal trends that could shape the influencer and creator markets. From novel platforms and technologies to shifts in audience engagement, here are five key trends to anticipate this year.\n\n1. Emphasis on Credibility\n\nConsumers today demand authenticity in their interactions with brands and influencers. This means creators must be more mindful of how their content is perceived and how it aligns with their personal brand. Companies and influencers will need to prioritize creating genuine content that resonates with their target audiences. This could involve real-time updates on products and services or meaningful engagements with followers.\n\n2. Rise of the 'Nano-Influencer'\n\nAnother trend to monitor in 2023 is the ascent of the 'nano-influencer'. These influencers boast smaller follower counts than traditional influencers but possess a fiercely loyal and dedicated fan base. As companies increasingly turn to nano-influencers to promote their products and services, larger influencers will likely differentiate themselves through exclusive content and experiences.\n\n3. Increased Value of Personal Brand Development\n\nBuilding a personal brand is becoming increasingly crucial for both influencers and content creators. As platforms like Instagram and YouTube continue to expand, the ability to stand out from the competition will become more vital than ever. Creators will need to focus on crafting unique and authentic content that resonates with their target audiences. This could involve creating videos and podcasts, engaging with fans on social media, and developing comprehensive brand strategies.\n\n4. Enhanced Integration of XR Technologies\n\nExtended reality (XR) technologies, including augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), are gaining traction in the influencer and creator space. These technologies enable the creation of immersive and engaging experiences for audiences and can be used to extend the reach of content to new platforms and audiences. We'll likely see more influencers and creators integrate these technologies into their content and strategies in 2023 as they seek to further engage with their fans and reach new audiences.\n\n5. Growing Demand for Sponsored Partnerships\n\nIn 2023, we're likely to witness even more influencers and creators embracing sponsored partnerships to monetize their content. Brands and influencers have already begun to recognize the potential of collaborating on sponsored partnerships, and it's likely that this will become more prevalent this year. Sponsored partnerships could take the form of sponsored posts, product placement, or endorsements, offering creators the opportunity to increase their incomes and reach new audiences.\n\nAs the influencer and creator economies continue to evolve, we can expect even more thrilling trends to emerge this year. Companies and creators will need to be proactive about staying ahead of the curve and adapting to the changing landscapes. By keeping an eye on these five trends, companies and influencers can ensure they remain at the forefront of the industry in 2023.", "label": "machine"}

Battleships\n\nOnce thought to be the cornerstone of naval power, the advent of naval aviation and the rise of the aircraft carrier in WWII was the beginning of the end for the large-gunned ships of the line.\n\nThough battleships saw continuous combat in WWII and Korea, the US Navy was left without an active battleship upon the decommissioning of the USS Wisconsin in March 1958; the first time since 1895.\n\nMost military enthusiasts are familiar with the Reagan administration's 600-ship Navy and the reactivation of the battleships USS Iowa, Missouri, New Jersey and Wisconsin.\n\nUSS Wisconsin firing its 16-inch guns during the Korean War. US Navy\n\nUSS New Jersey would be the first to fire her massive 16-inch guns at enemy targets again during the Lebanese Civil War from 1983-1984.\n\nUSS Missouri and Wisconsin would return to combat in 1991 during the Gulf War. However, USS New Jersey was brought back into active service once before.\n\nFollowing the beginning of Operation Rolling Thunder in 1965, the loss of US aircraft over Vietnam increased exponentially.\n\nThe planes that took part in the sustained aerial bombardment campaign were exceptionally vulnerable to sophisticated Soviet-made surface-to-air weapon systems provided to the North Vietnamese.\n\nUSS Missouri fires a Tomahawk cruise missile at an Iraqi target in January 1991. US Navy\n\nIn an effort to alleviate these air losses while still delivering ordnance payloads, USS New Jersey was brought out of mothballs in April 1968 and modernized for active service in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe only active battleship in the world, New Jersey joined the gun line off the Vietnamese coast on September 25.\n\nFive days later, she fired her first shots in over 16 years during an engagement against PAVN targets near the DMZ at the 17th parallel. She would go on to fire 14,891 5-inch shells and 5,688 16-inch shells during the war in support of ARVN, US and even Korean troops.\n\n2. M14 rifle\n\nUS troops with the M14 Enhanced Battle Rifle. US Army\n\nAn evolution of the famed M1 Garand of WWII and Korea, the M14 battle rifle became the standard-issue rifle for the US military in 1959.\n\nFiring the 7.62 x 51 mm NATO round, the M14 was meant to streamline logistics efforts by replacing the M1 Garand, M1903 Springfield, M1917 Enfield, M1 carbine, M3 submachine gun, M1928/M1 Thompson submachine gun, and M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle.\n\nWhile the M14 exhibited outstanding accuracy and stopping power in its semi-automatic setting, its full-power cartridge was deemed too powerful for the submachine gun role and its light weight made it difficult to control during automatic fire as a light machine gun.\n\nAn infantry marksman provides security in the Spin Boldak district of Afghanistan in July 2012. US Army\n\nThough the M14 was replaced by the M16 as the standard-issue rifle in 1968, it found a new role as a precision rifle platform. It served as the basis of the M21 Sniper Weapon System introduced in 1968 and M25 Sniper Weapon System introduced in 1991.\n\nThough both weapon systems have been largely replaced by the M24 Sniper Weapon System, the M14 lives on as the Mk14 Enhanced Battle Rifle. Introduced in 2002, the Mk14 is a truer reincarnation of the M14.\n\nWhere the M21 and M25 were restricted to semi-automatic fire, designated as Sniper Weapon Systems and saw more restricted issuance as a result, the Mk14 sees the return of selective fire, the designation as a battle rifle for both designated marksman and close combat roles, and issuance by the Army to two riflemen per infantry platoon deploying to Afghanistan.\n\n3. Guns on fighter planes\n\nAn F-35A uses its 25 mm cannon during training in Utah in August 2018. US Air Force/Todd Cromar\n\nWith the advent of radar-guided and heat-seeking air-to-air missiles, like the AIM-7 Sparrow and AIM-9 Sidewinder, and the new threat of high-altitude, long-range Soviet bombers, US air-combat doctrine called for the elimination of gun armament on fighter-interceptor aircraft.\n\nThough dedicated attack and fighter aircraft like the A-4 Skyhawk, A-7 Corsair II and the F-8 Crusader retained 20mm cannons for ground attack and close-range aerial combat, interceptors like the F-86D Sabre, F-102 Delta Dagger and the F-4 Phantom II dispensed with any type of gun armament in favor of rockets and missiles.\n\nThe idea during the late '50s and early '60s was that these types of aircraft would engage in long-range combat without visual contact of their target and even if they did get close enough to see the enemy that the new Sidewinder missile would be able to dispense with a hostile fighter with ease.\n\nA US airman inspects an M61A1 Vulcan cannon on an F-16 at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska in March. US Air National Guard/Staff Sgt. Kregg York\n\nThis idea proved to be fatal for pilots over the skies of Vietnam. For Phantom II pilots in particular, who escorted bomber flights over North Vietnam, the lack of a gun often left them without offensive options during a dogfight.\n\nA Marine Corps general recalled, \"Everyone in RF-4s wished we had a gun on the aircraft.\"\n\nAs any \"Top Gun\" fan can tell you, the American air-to-air kill ratio in Korea was 12:1. According to the US Naval Institute, the Navy's kill ratio in Vietnam was just 2.5:1. The drop in kill ratio was attributed to poor missile accuracy at just 10% and lack of dogfighting skills.\n\nThe latter resulted in the creation of TOPGUN while the former resulted in the addition of an external gun pod to the Phantom II. An internally mounted gun was incorporated on the later F-4E models.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "For influencers, receiving \"gifted\" items from brands can feel \"excessive and gluttonous,\" one said.\n\nMany decline free products, or if they receive them, they don't always post about them.\n\nBut some items, like furniture and luxury products, can make such a collaboration attractive.\n\nWhen the TikTok influencer Victoria Paris became famous on social media, she began to get so many free products from brands that she felt overwhelmed.\n\n\"A lot of it felt excessive and gluttonous,\" Paris, who has 1.5 million followers, previously told Insider. \"At one point, packages just started showing up that I didn't even approve because companies will sell your address or use it for brands you don't even know about.\"\n\nShe said she started declining most free items, and when she moved across the US last summer, she didn't communicate it to brands so she could avoid being flooded with unwanted public-relations products.\n\nParis' decision fits into a broader effort among some influencers to reduce the number of items they're sent and to ask brands to pay them in cash, as opposed to products.\n\nBut there seems to be at least one big exception to this rule: furniture.\n\nParis and five other influencer-industry insiders said furniture was still a desirable category of products that worked for \"gifted\" collaborations \u2014 or when a brand pays using a product instead of cash.\n\n\"Brands are more inclined to gift higher-price-point items if they know they'll get content out of it,\" Paris added.\n\nCreators and other industry insiders said gifted partnerships that involve furniture \u2014 as well as a few other types of luxury items \u2014 could be mutually beneficial.\n\nCallie Wilson, who has 1 million TikTok followers, said that when furniture or luxury brands offered products in exchange for content, she considered that to be different from \"average gifting\" because the items are higher in value.\n\nAnd when it comes to products that can benefit a creator or make their life easier (like fridges or dishwashers), it's more common for them to accept gifted collaborations, according to Annelise Campbell, the founder and CEO of the marketing agency CFG.\n\nHarley Jordan, a micro influencer with 33,000 Instagram followers and the founder of All Influence Collective, said that while influencers should always strive to get paid when they create content for brands, big-ticket items could be important exceptions.\n\n\"My mattress is gifted, and that was the best gifting collaboration that I've ever done,\" she said. \"It's high ticket, and that'll move mountains.\"", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Graham Cochrane, Founder of The Recording Revolution, started his business in 2009 during The Great Recession.\n\nWhen starting a business, it's sometimes hard to know what to prioritize, and going at it alone can be overwhelming. But there are strategies you can use to avoid common pitfalls. My mission is to teach people how to earn money from their passions. It's what I did: I went from living on food stamps to building two online businesses. Today, I run a music blog, The Recording Revolution, and a entrepreneurship coaching company. I work just five hours a week from my home office and make $160,000 a month in passive income. Here's what I tell my 3,000 clients to think about in the first 30 days of starting a business:\n\n1. Be clear about how you want to spend your time.\n\nMany new business owners I meet know only one thing: how much money they want to make. While that's a great starting point, it's incomplete. Your business should serve your life, not the other way around. So make sure it aligns with your hopes, dreams and goals. To get clear about the type of business and life you want, ask three questions: What does a perfect day look like to you? Don't just think about your typical workday. Consider other life activities you want to fit into your day, like exercising or spending time with family. How many hours do you want to work a week? You don't have to follow the standard 40-hour workweek. Knowing exactly how many hours you want to work will help you better prioritize tasks. How important is time off? Some people don't care much about taking time off, as long as they love what they do. Others value extended time off. In order to have money flowing in when you're not working, you'll need to have some sort of passive income stream.\n\n2. Simplify your business model.\n\nWhen I started my music education business, people told me I needed to test my sales pages, throw launch parties and pre-record a bunch of ads in order to grow. Rather than stretching myself thin doing things that didn't make sense to me, I kept it simple and focused on three things: creating weekly content for my blog and YouTube channel, growing my email list from that audience, and promoting the paid products I created to that list. If you're just starting out, develop content around your expertise to grow an audience. It doesn't have to be perfect. You can iterate as you go and design new products based on what your customers want more of.\n\n3. Cut out unnecessary daily tasks.\n\nIdentify what daily activities will help you earn more. Don't waste time or burn yourself out focusing on unimportant tasks. It might feel good to get to inbox zero or change the color of the buttons on your website, especially in the early days where you want to feel like you've achieved a goal. But neither of those things will make you money. Before you start a new task, ask yourself three questions: What's the expected outcome for doing this task? Does it lead to more money? Can I point to a direct link between doing that task and earning income? What's the cost of doing this instead of something else?\n\n4. Prioritize having fun.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Illustration: Benjamin Currie/HuffPost; Photo: Getty Thirty-nine percent of American Jews have changed their behavior out of fear of antisemitism, according to a 2021 report by the American Jewish Committee.\n\nFor American Jews, the threat of antisemitism has become increasingly worrisome over the last few years.\n\nThough they make up less than 3% of the U.S. population, Jews are disproportionately targeted in hate crimes in America. Last year, 1 in 4 American Jews said they had experienced antisemitism in some form, according to a survey by the American Jewish Committee. Meanwhile, one-third of Jewish students experienced antisemitism on college campuses in 2021, according to a study by the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThirty-nine percent of American Jews have changed their behavior out of fear of antisemitism, according to a 2021 report by the American Jewish Committee. This includes not publicly identifying as a Jew, avoiding carrying or wearing markers that would identify them as Jewish, avoiding places or events for safety reasons and avoiding posting online content that identifies them as Jewish.\n\nSo much of this fear can be attributed to the normalization of anti-Jewish rhetoric and conspiratorial discourse in public life: Republican candidates, NBA stars including Kyrie Irving and rappers such as Ye have all floated conspiracy theories about Jews with relative impunity.\n\nIn the case of Ye (formerly known as Kanye West), he has praised Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. While appearing earlier this month on right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones\u2019 Infowars show, the rapper and designer said he \u201cloves\u201d Nazis and that the \u201cthe Jewish media has made us feel like the Nazis and Hitler have never offered anything of value to the world.\u201d\n\nDiscourse like this doesn\u2019t just end in antisemitic memes being spread on Twitter. (Though it encourages that, too; antisemitic posts referring to Jews or Judaism have soared more than 61% in the two weeks since Elon Musk acquired the site.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s much more dangerous than memes, said Beth Kean, the CEO of the Holocaust Museum LA.\n\n\u201cThese celebrities are furthering Holocaust denial and emboldening right-wing extremist groups who now feel empowered to express their hate in broad daylight,\u201d Kean said. \u201cWe see this in everything from antisemitic flyers littering lawns and cars in neighborhoods nationwide to large public displays with swastikas on the 405 Freeway in Los Angeles, a cemetery in Chicago and a stadium in Jacksonville.\u201d\n\nToday on the 405 in Los Angeles. We are waiting @adidas. pic.twitter.com/C39gLLu4Wb \u2014 Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) October 23, 2022\n\nThis rise in antisemitic rhetoric comes just four years after a Pittsburgh synagogue attack that left 11 Jewish people dead \u2015 the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history.\n\nThose who espouse such views seem to disregard the potentially violent effect their words may have on others, Kean said. The Holocaust started with just words, she noted.\n\n\u201cWe know what can happen when hatred and bigotry go unchecked,\u201d she said. \u201cMy grandmother was a Holocaust survivor. She watched her parents and siblings walk into the gas chambers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeremy Burton, the CEO of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Boston, told HuffPost that all Americans need to recognize that antisemitism is not just a Jewish problem to fight; it\u2019s everyone\u2019s problem.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep living our lives and building vibrant Jewish communities, but antisemitism is a virus that infects our society,\u201d Burton said. \u201cAn America where Jews can no longer live freely without fear is not the America that any decent person should want to be part of.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake antisemitism your problem to fight,\u201d he added. \u201cDon\u2019t look away.\u201d\n\nWhat does taking a stand look like? Below, experts share six ways to help combat antisemitism and be a better ally to the Jewish community.\n\nDon\u2019t normalize antisemitism.\n\nFor Burton, the most deeply trouble part of this moment is how antisemitism is being normalized by so-called legitimate actors. Anti-Jewish statements that a few years ago would have been unutterable are all over our social media and television screens.\n\n\u201cThere have been neo-Nazis out there for decades, but now they are having dinner with a former president,\u201d he told HuffPost, referring to Donald Trump\u2019s dinner at Mar-a-Lago last month with Ye and white nationalist Nick Fuentes. \u201cAnd it isn\u2019t just that a celebrity tweets a swastika but that tens of thousands of other people then \u2018like\u2019 and retweet that post within hours.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConscientious people have taken notice to some extent, Burton said, but more can be done.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think people have fully wrapped their minds around how much is changing, how fast and how dangerous it is,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they did, I\u2019d like to believe that there\u2019d be more wall-to-wall outrage than we\u2019re seeing right now.\u201d\n\nReport antisemitism and call out discrimination.\n\nIf you experience or witness an act of antisemitism, extremism, bigotry or hate, report it to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). If it\u2019s an emergency, first call 911.\n\n\u201cPublic reports enable ADL to gather information needed to educate lawmakers and law enforcement and to advocate for individuals and groups that are targeted because of their religion, race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, origin or level of ability,\u201d Kean explained.\n\nReport antisemitic posts on social media, too, she said, and put pressure on business leaders who are profiting off of hate and antisemitic materials (for instance, books that promote Holocaust denial on Amazon) and promoting hate speech.\n\nIf you hear someone say something antisemitic even in passing, be courageous and say something back. If it comes from someone you know, engage them and figure out if it is coming from ignorance or genuine hate, said Carly F. Gammill, the director of the StandWithUs Center for Combating Antisemitism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTry educating them calmly about why their words or actions are offensive,\u201d she said.\n\nCatherine Falls Commercial via Getty Images If you see antisemitic remarks on social media, call them out and report them.\n\nDon\u2019t just think, \u201cI already knows what antisemitism is.\u201d Dig deeper to understand the roots of antisemitism and the Holocaust.\n\nRabbi Isaiah Rothstein, a rabbinic scholar and public affairs adviser at the Jewish Federation of North America, thinks that many Americans are misinformed about Jewish history and misunderstand who the Jewish people are.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t always listen to how we define ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are a multiracial, multiethnic and multicultural people whose families come from more than 70 countries around the world. We need to be students of each other\u2019s past so we can drive towards a better future that works for all peoples.\u201d\n\nRothstein recommends reading books like Paul Johnson\u2019s \u201cHistory of the Jews\u201d and Deborah Lipstadt\u2019s \u201cAntisemitism Here and Now.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo further your understanding, visit a museum or education center near you to learn about how what started with \u201cjust words\u201d led to the systematic mass murder of 6 million Jews and millions of others, including LGBTQ individuals and people with disabilities.\n\n\u201cEach day at our Holocaust museum, we teach the critical lessons and social relevancy of the Holocaust and other genocides to empower students and the public to stand up against hatred, bigotry and antisemitism,\u201d said Kean, the CEO of the Los Angeles Holocaust museum.\n\nMany of these institutions also offer opportunities to meet and talk with a Holocaust survivor to learn from a firsthand witness.\n\nNot sure where to go? Check out the Association of Holocaust Organizations, an international network of more than 370 organizations and individuals working for the advancement of Holocaust education, remembrance and research.\n\nGary Coronado/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images Students from Lawndale High School in the Los Angeles area visit the Holocaust Museum LA on Oct. 26. As part of their visit, they heard from a 99-year-old survivor of the Holocaust.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t let antisemitism become a partisan issue. (And don\u2019t assume antisemitism is only perpetrated by white supremacists).\n\nDon\u2019t allow antisemitism to be turned into yet another partisan issue, Burton said.\n\n\u201cThe fight against antisemitism should not be weaponized for partisan advantage,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t be a conservative who only calls out antisemitism on the left, or a progressive who only calls it out on the right.\u201d\n\nTake the time to learn and understand how antisemitism may show up in your own circles, and call it out there. \u201cIt may be a little more uncomfortable to do so, but that\u2019s where you can make the greatest difference,\u201d he said.\n\nAntisemitism can be perpetuated by anyone, not just white supremacists.\n\n\u201cThere is a misconception that antisemitism only comes from neo-Nazis and white supremacists,\u201d Rothstein said. \u201cWhile these ideologies are, of course, steeped in antisemitism, the last 60 years have seen a dramatic increase of antisemitism across the political spectrum, from the far right to the far left.\u201d\n\nBy typecasting all antisemites as white supremacists, antisemitism \u2015 which is present in nearly all spaces, communities and movements \u2015 can too easily be dismissed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis limits our ability to identify, mitigate and course correct,\u201d the rabbi said.\n\nIra L. Black/Corbis via Getty Images Marchers protesting antisemitism cross the Brooklyn Bridge on Jan. 2, 2020, in New York City as part of the No Hate No Fear Solidarity March.\n\nEncourage your workplace to include antisemitism education in its DEI program.\n\nBecause many people don\u2019t understand or recognize anti-Jewish biases, Jewish people in the workplace often experience microaggressions, invalidations, assaults and outright discrimination, Rothstein said.\n\n\u201cFor instance, many don\u2019t realize that religion is only one organizing aspect of the Jewish people,\u201d he said. \u201cJews encompass all races and ethnicities, and many hold transgenerational trauma from decades of systemic genocide, persecution and discrimination.\u201d\n\nBecause there\u2019s so much nuance and outside confusion about the Jewish community, consider pushing to include more on the Jewish American experience in your company\u2019s training on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).\n\n\u201cTraining and initiatives to increase awareness of antisemitism as a DEI issue would significantly reduce antisemitism, especially if the lessons were centered as a critical inclusion and belonging issue,\u201d the rabbi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJasmin Merdan via Getty Images Rabbi Isaiah Rothstein thinks training and initiatives to increase awareness of antisemitism as a workplace issue of diversity, equity and inclusion would significantly reduce antisemitism.\n\nTeach your kids about antisemitism, too.\n\nA national survey conducted by the ADL in 2020 showed that students who get Holocaust education in high school are more empathetic, tolerant and open-minded.\n\n\u201cEducators need to teach and facilitate age-appropriate discussions in their classrooms on how to address racism, bigotry and hatred, and legislators must prioritize anti-hate programs in schools,\u201d Kean said.\n\nIn California, for instance, Gov. Gavin Newsom launched the Governor\u2019s Council on Holocaust and Genocide Education to promote Holocaust and genocide education with the mission to provide students with the tools necessary to recognize and respond to bigotry and discrimination.\n\nIf you are a parent or grandparent, there\u2019s room to educate, too. Maybe you talk to your kids about Ye\u2019s recent comments and use it as an opening to discuss antisemitism and other forms of bias.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you plan to visit a Holocaust museum or Jewish education center, bring the kids along.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "America needs carpenters and plumbers. Try telling that to Gen Z\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption David Zalubowski/AP David Zalubowski/AP\n\nJustin Mwandjalulu, 20, loves to build stuff.\n\nThese days, as a carpentry apprentice, he installs drywall in houses with the rest of his construction crew. But he said he likes concrete the best.\n\n\"At the end of the day, you see how you poured everything. The result of your hard work,\" he said.\n\nMwandjalulu dreamed of becoming a carpenter or electrician as a child. And now he's fulfilling that dream. But that also makes him an exception to the rule. While Gen Z \u2014 often described as people born between 1997 and 2012 \u2014 is on track to become the most educated generation, fewer young folks are opting for traditionally hands-on jobs in the skilled trade and technical industries.\n\nGen Z interest in trades and skilled work has dropped\n\nThe number of young people seeking technical jobs \u2014 like plumbing, building and electrical work \u2014 dropped by 49% in 2022 compared to 2020, according to data from online recruiting platform Handshake shared with NPR.\n\nResearchers from Handshake tracked how the number of applications for technical roles vs. the number of job postings has changed over the last two years.\n\nWhile postings for those roles \u2014 automotive technicians, equipment installers and respiratory therapists, to name a few \u2014 saw about 10 applications each in 2020, they got about five per posting in 2022.\n\nThe typical rate is about 19 applications per job on Handshake, according to Christine Cruzvergara, the company's chief education strategy officer.\n\nWhile the creation of technical positions has continued to grow, the number of students interested in applying for them \u2014 hasn't.\n\nOccupations such as auto technician with aging workforces have the U.S. Chamber of Commerce warning of a \"massive\" shortage of skilled workers in 2023.\n\n\"For a long time, our society has not talked favorably about the skilled trades,\" said Cruzvergara. \"We've instead encouraged students to all go to college, all go to four-year institutions, graduate, go out into white collar jobs.\"\n\nOne path does not fit all\n\nMwandjalulu, who lives in Iowa City, Iowa and is in his second year of a four-year carpentry apprenticeship, found school difficult.\n\nHe immigrated with his family to the United States from Benin, Africa, when he was a freshman.\n\n\"Man, it was hard,\" he said. While his twin brother, now studying to work in banking, excelled, Mwandjalulu said he struggled with writing and English.\n\n\"I'm not the type of guy that likes being in the same spot all day long, dealing with papers and stuff,\" he said.\n\nAround high school graduation, Mwandjalulu said he got depressed because he didn't know what he wanted to do with his life. Many of his older friends who went to college and graduated were struggling to find jobs.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Justin Mwandjalulu Justin Mwandjalulu\n\n\"I didn't want to look like them,\" he said. \"I didn't want to just spend money and have a lot of loans and not use my papers,\" he said, referring to a degree and a diploma.\n\nAccording to the Department of Education, about 45 million people in the United States owe nearly $1.3 trillion in student debt.\n\nBut Mwandjalulu, who makes nearly $24 an hour as a carpenter, said he's still had trouble convincing his friends, whom he keeps in touch with on Facebook and Snapchat, to follow his path.\n\n\"There's not a lot of people, especially immigrants, that think outside of school,\" he said.\n\nThe narrative is shifting\n\nPaul Iversen, a labor educator with University of Iowa's Labor Center, hopes to change that.\n\nIversen, who helps helps run a pre-apprenticeship program, said one of the reasons participation in the skilled trades is low among Gen Z is because the work was once typically passed down in families.\n\n\"It used to be word-of-mouth,\" said Iversen. \"But there's more of a need for carpenters, pipefitters, plumbers and electricians than you can fill with the family members of current people.\"\n\nThat reality is hitting home for farmer John Boyd Jr.\n\nBoyd, 57, owns a 300-acre farm in Virginia where he grows soybeans, corn and wheat and raises cattle \u2014 just as three generations did before him. But now, none of his three children want to take over when he retires.\n\n\"Everybody on my farm is over the age of 50,\" said Boyd, who is the president of the National Black Farmers' Association. \"We need some young people with some energy and hustle and innovation.\"\n\nMichael Coleman, 28, is one of them. He received a scholarship from the NBFA in 2015 to study animal science at the University of Nebraska.\n\nColeman is now an animal health technician with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and dreams of one day owning his own farm. But, at times, he's found it a lonely field.\n\nThe average age of a U.S. farmer is 57.5, according to the 2017 US Agriculture Census, up from 54.9 in 2007, and Coleman said he's only met a couple other farmers around his age.\n\n\"We kind of stick together,\" he said.\n\nThere is plenty of need\n\nBut Coleman said he's seen more young people express interest in agribusiness and other technical industries, particularly after the pandemic.\n\n\"Especially with student loans and everything, it's a lot cheaper to get a trade and make a lot of money,\" said Coleman. Most young folks just haven't had people show them the ropes,\" he said.\n\nStill, filling trade and technical jobs takes active recruitment, said Iversen, who pays frequent visits to high schools around Iowa City and works with school counselors to place students in the pre-apprenticeship program.\n\nNow especially, there's an urgency to fill open posts, said Iversen, as the federal government funnels billions into projects to upgrade roads and transit systems across the country.\n\n\"We have to recruit people to do these things or else our bridges are going to fall apart,\" Iversen said.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nScoot over, Facebook and Instagram.\n\nThere\u2019s a newer photo-sharing app \u2013 and it\u2019s not like other social media platforms.\n\nThe app is called BeReal. And while you may not have heard of it, a lot of young people are signing up. Its active monthly users have skyrocketed this year by more than 315%, according to data from Apptopia, which tracks and analyzes performance.\n\nWe joined the app and talked to users to get a deeper understanding of how BeReal works and what you need to know about it.\n\nSo, what\u2019s BeReal?\n\nBeReal is a social media app that encourages users to share a slice of their life in real time. It was launched in early 2020 by an entrepreneur in France but a majority of its users \u2013 at least 65% \u2013 have signed up this calendar year.\n\nAs its name suggests, the focus is on authenticity. Users are invited once a day to share a photo of what they\u2019re doing at that moment, giving friends and others an unvarnished glimpse into their life.\n\nIt has no filters and no edit buttons. So if your hair is a mess at that moment and your view is of a rainy parking lot, that\u2019s what people will see.\n\nThe result is a far cry from the polished, overly curated photos popular on other social media platforms.\n\nThe BeReal app launched in late 2020 and is rapidly growing in popularity among young people. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe concept of BeReal is simple. Once you download the app, you get a notification once a day that it\u2019s time to \u201cBeReal.\u201d That means you have two minutes to snap and post a photo of what you\u2019re doing, no matter how mundane.\n\nThere\u2019s no set time \u2013 the notification comes at random times of the day \u2013 adding to the app\u2019s mystique.\n\n\u201cPush notifications are sent around the world simultaneously at different times each day,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s a secret on how the time is chosen every day, it\u2019s not random.\u201d\n\nThat means the potential window into your life can open at any time. When it does, the app invites you to take a photo of what you\u2019re up to at that moment. It takes a dual photo \u2013 a selfie and one showing what\u2019s in front of you. (BeReal doesn\u2019t permit videos yet.)\n\nThe result is a social feed filled with unedited photos of people doing mostly everyday, unglamorous things \u2013 lounging in pajamas, doing homework, riding the bus, microwaving their dinner.\n\nWith only one post a day, there\u2019s no clutter of friends\u2019 pictures to mindlessly scroll through. You can only see friends\u2019 posts if you share a photo, which eliminates lurkers. Some people turn off their location for privacy reasons, since the app works in real time.\n\nGeorgetown University student Ben Telerski, 21, is an avid social media user and joined the app in August.\n\n\u201cWhat I like about BeReal is I am able to make connections with my friends via social media on a platform that does not incentivize likes, comments, or being artificial. \u2026 solely showing your friends what you are doing at the moment that the daily alert goes off,\u201d says Telerski, a junior majoring in government.\n\nTelerski says the posts he sees on the app are generally more authentic compared to other social media platforms.\n\n\u201cI try to post as soon as I see the notification, even if I am just sitting in bed or walking to class,\u201d he says. \u201cI think the amount of authenticity depends on the persona each person creates on social media. If someone tries to keep their social media presence highly polished and produced, BeReal is not the app to use.\u201d\n\nBen Telerski and Alexandra Henn in an image from his BeReal app. The app takes a dual photo showing the user's selfie and what's in front of them. Courtesy Ben Telerski\n\nWhat happens if you don\u2019t post within the two minutes?\n\nWhen you click on the once-a-day BeReal notification, your camera opens within the app along with a timer with a two-minute countdown. You have until the timer runs out to take a picture of what\u2019s in front of you. At the same time, your rear-facing camera snaps a selfie.\n\nThe app will share both images. You can retake them anytime during the two minutes and share them with friends when you\u2019re ready.\n\nBeReal also allows users to take and post the photo later in the day. But it lets your friends know how many hours past the notification that you posted. In short, it puts you on blast for your lack of spontaneity.\n\nWhy are people using it?\n\nBeReal has tapped into marketing on college campuses. It recruits young users via its college ambassador program, which allows students to host events that educate others about the app.\n\nTelerski believes the app is popular because it\u2019s an antidote to the pressures to look perfect online.\n\n\u201cI have seen a lot of news coverage lately about the negative mental health impacts that social media has on Gen Z. I do not know if BeReal is directly attempting to combat this problem, but it is certainly making some ground toward that goal,\u201d he says.\n\nBeReal won\u2019t make you famous, if you want to become an influencer you can stay on TikTok and Instagram. BeReal\n\nMorgan Nott, 26, manages a tea shop in Reno and is a newbie on the app. She started using it last week at a friend\u2019s suggestion. Nott says she finds it refreshing to get a non-airbrushed, non-idealized glimpse into other people\u2019s lives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the authenticity of it that makes it so appealing. Users aren\u2019t as glamorized or fake as some can portray themselves on other platforms,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s something different.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, BeReal says its goal is to create \u201can alternative to addictive social networks\u201d that focus on amassing influence, it says.\n\n\u201cBeReal is your chance to show your friends who you really are,\u201d the company says. \u201cBeReal won\u2019t make you famous, if you want to become an influencer you can stay on TikTok and Instagram.\u201d\n\nAre BeReal posts really so authentic?\n\nThe app doesn\u2019t give you much time to put on makeup or stage your surroundings before you snap and post photos.\n\nBut some users may still try to curate their lives on the app.\n\n\u201cThere is the potential to be just as artificial on BeReal as people tend to be on other platforms,\u201d Telerski says. Some people might ignore the notification to post at a certain time and wait to post until they are dressed up and out at dinner with friends, he says.\n\n\u201cIt is not in the spirit of BeReal and entirely defeats the purpose,\u201d he says. \u201cBeReal should be full of pictures of (people) walking, doing homework and sitting in bed watching Netflix.\u201d\n\nThe young people CNN spoke to have no plans to give up Instagram, TikTok and other social media apps.\n\nNott says she plans to keep letting her guard down on BeReal \u2013 and to keep posting on other social media platforms as well.\n\nTelerski says he tries to maintain a certain level of authenticity on social media regardless of the platform. Authenticity is determined by a person, not an app, he says.\n\n\u201cFor those who think we need a new social media app in order to be truly authentic, maybe we should take that as a sign to be more authentic throughout our existing social media presence,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThink about what social media was originally intended for \u2013 real connection through family and friends keeping up with your life. Maybe we should get back to that.\u201d", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The Idaho police chief who led the high-profile investigation into the slayings of four students at the University of Idaho in November, said he regretted not being more open with the public after the November homicides.\n\n\"I took the responsibility at the very beginning for not getting out into the press and talking about it. That would be a thing I would change in the future. It's a learned lesson,\" Moscow Police Chief James Fry told NBC News on Saturday during an emotional sit-down interview in which he teared up.\n\nFry said getting a message out earlier could have reduced some public anxiety and fear.\n\nA more transparent approach, Fry said, would \"give a little bit of assurance to people that we've locked the scene down. We're getting search warrants. We got the state police coming. We got the FBI coming. I think that gives a little bit of calm.\"\n\nFry and the department were heavily criticized during the nearly two-month investigation for a lack of transparency and for sending mixed messages about the case.\n\nThe shocking crimes have captivated the nation, generating about 19,000 tips from the public that police said were crucial to the probe.\n\nBryan Christopher Kohberger, 28, a resident of Pullman, Washington, was apprehended in Albrightsville in northeastern Pennsylvania, about 2,500 miles from the Idaho campus, officials announced Friday.\n\nHe\u2019ll be charged with four counts of first-degree murder and burglary, for allegedly breaking into the Moscow, Idaho, home with the intent to commit a felony, authorities said.\n\nDNA evidence played a key role in linking the murders to Kohberger, two law enforcement sources familiar with the investigation told NBC News.\n\nKohberger was arrested by the Pennsylvania State Police seven weeks after four students were stabbed to death in their beds \u2014 an event that stunned residents in tiny Moscow, perplexed police and prompted a nationwide manhunt.\n\nFry apologized Saturday to the families of the victims for their heartache. He said he hoped the suspect's arrest leads to some closure for the families and noted investigators will do everything possible to provide them with answers.\n\n\"We care. We've always cared and we'll continue to work hard to give them the answers they need. We can give them answers and we can give them some closure to understand. That's what we're here to offer. That's what we're here to accomplish.\"\n\nKohberger appeared to have a keen interest in crime. He was listed as a Ph.D. student in the department of criminal justice and criminology at Washington State University (WSU), which is 10 miles west and just across the state line from the University of Idaho.\n\nA Pennsylvania judge in Monroe County, north of Allentown, on Friday ordered that Kohberger be extradited to Idaho next month, court records showed.\n\nKilled in the Nov. 13 attack were Ethan Chapin, 20, of Conway, Washington; Madison Mogen, 21, of Coeur d\u2019Alene, Idaho; Xana Kernodle, 20, of Avondale, Arizona; and Kaylee Goncalves, 21, of Rathdrum, Idaho.\n\nFrom top left, Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Ethan Chapin and Xana Kernodle.\n\nAuthorities have not released a motive in the slayings and Fry has said he's shielded by law in what he can disclose to public.\n\nA probable cause affidavit, with details supporting Kohberger\u2019s arrest, is sealed and cannot be made public until he sets foot in Idaho and is served with those papers in court, authorities said.\n\nOn Saturday the public defender of Monroe County, Pennsylvania, where Kohberger is being held, says he intends to waive his extradition hearing to face charges in Idaho.\n\n\u201cHe should be presumed innocent until proven otherwise \u2014 not tried in the court of public opinion,\u201d public defender Jason LaBar says in a statement, adding, \u201cMr. Kohberger is eager to be exonerated of these charges and looks forward to resolving these matters as promptly as possible.\u201d\n\nFry said Saturday despite all the criticism his department faced, he tried not to listen to it.\n\nAuthorities have said investigators didn't want to disclose key details of the investigation in order not to compromise a potential conviction and so a suspect wouldn't be tipped off.\n\n\"I had a job to do. I stayed focused on that. I stayed true to that,\" Fry said. \"We stayed true and the result is we got an individual in custody.\"\n\nIn Monroe County, Pa. where the suspect was apprehended Friday, some residents interviewed by NBC News recounted run-ins with Kohberger prior to the slayings in Idaho.\n\nJordan Serulneck, 34, lives in Center Valley, and is owner of Seven Sirens Brewing Company. Serulneck says Kohberger came to his brewery a few times and female staff would often complain about his behavior. Serulneck said the brewery is located in a college town and it\u2019s not unusual for them to get \u201cunusual characters,\u201d but he remembered Kohberger from some interactions he had with female patrons and staff. He said Kohberger often come by himself, sit at the bar and be \u201cobserving and watching.\u201d\n\nSerulneck said staff scans everyone\u2019s ID\u2019s and they have a system where they can add notes about a patron that pop up whenever the ID is scanned.\n\n\u201cStaff put in there, \u2018Hey, this guy makes creepy comments, keep an eye on him. He\u2019ll have two or three beers and then just get a little too comfortable.\u2019\u201d Serulneck said Kohberger would ask the female staff or customers who they were at the brewery with, where they lived. He said if the women blew him off, \u201che would get upset with them a little bit,\u201d noting that one time he called one of his staff members a b---- when she refused to answer his questions.\n\nThese interactions were months ago, Serulneck said, likely when Kohberger was a student at DeSales. During their final interaction Serulneck said he approached Kohberger.\n\n\u201cI went up to him and I said, \u2018Hey Bryan, welcome back. We appreciate you coming back. \u2026 I just wanted to talk to you real quick and make sure that you\u2019re going to be respectful this time and we\u2019re not going to have any issues.\u2019\" He said Kohberger was taken aback. \"He was shocked that I was saying that, and he said, \u2018I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. You totally have me confused.\u2019\u201d He said Kohberger had one beer and left and he never came back to the brewery.\n\nBK Norton, a WSU classmate of Kohberger, told NBC News that they first met him in August at a student orientation. \"We took classes together this past semester. We didn\u2019t work on any project together but we spent extensive time together because our courses were very long,\" Norton said. Norton said Kohberger seemed \"odd from the beginning\" but they thought it was because he was awkward.\n\n\"I am in complete shock over this murder, because he continued to attend classes and continued on like nothing had happened, I still can\u2019t wrap my head around it,\" Norton said. \"He did attend class, up until the end of the semester and seemed more upbeat, honestly. When discussed in class, Bryan did not mention or contribute to the conversation of the murders. We were released from class early after the murders to get home when it was still light out, and Bryan was in those classes with us.\"\n\nMinyvonne Burke reporting from Monroe County, Pennsylvania.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "A keen observer of the Chinese coal market might deduce that the nation's economic resurgence is gaining momentum. Coal prices in key hubs, such as Qinhuangdao and Caofeidian, have been trending upward over the past few months as economic activity gradually recovers.\n\nThis development is in line with expectations that China, the world's largest coal consumer and importer, will reboot its economy following the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to increased demand for coal and higher prices.\n\nChina's coal imports experienced a significant year-on-year increase of 18.7% to 26.4 million tonnes in October, according to the General Administration of Customs. This follows a 7.4% rise for the same period last year, indicating that domestic coal producers are intensifying efforts to meet the heightened demand.\n\nMuch of the imported coal originates from outside the country, and there has been increased activity at China's key coal import hubs. Qinhuangdao port and Caofeidian port have both seen increased activity in recent months, remaining the primary gateways for imported coal entering China.\n\nQinhuangdao, the largest coal port in the country, witnessed record-high imports in October, with over 25.3 million tonnes of coal brought into the port, according to data from the China National Coal Association. This represents a 5.4% increase compared to the same period last year.\n\nThe port's increased activity is driven by the restocking of coal inventories by steel mills in anticipation of the winter season, as well as strong demand from the power sector, both of which are causing spot prices at the port to rise.\n\nMeanwhile, Caofeidian port saw coal imports total around 1.2 million tonnes in October, more than double the same period a year ago, suggesting that the port is experiencing the same uptick in activity.\n\nThe port has become increasingly attractive in recent months due to its relatively lower fees and taxes compared to other ports, making it a popular choice for buyers.\n\nOverall, the increased activity at China's key coal import hubs is indicative of the nation's economic recovery and the rebound in demand for coal. It is clear that the nation is prepared to rely on coal as part of its recovery efforts and that the industry is ready to meet the heightened demand.\n\nAnalysts expect this trend to continue in the months ahead, with coal prices expected to remain supported and imports set to remain strong.\n\nThis is positive news for coal producers and consumers worldwide, as China is one of the largest markets for both. With the nation's economic recovery back on track, this could be a long-term boon for the global coal industry.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nRepublican Rep.-elect George Santos admitted to stealing a man\u2019s checkbook that was in his mother\u2019s possession to purchase clothing and shoes in 2008, according to documents obtained by CNN.\n\nThe admission came in a statement Santos gave to police in 2010, according to 150 pages worth of case documents.\n\nPolice had suspended an investigation into Santos because they were unable to find him for nearly a decade. But law enforcement officials in Brazil will reinstate fraud charges against the New York Republican, CNN reported Tuesday.\n\nSantos used stolen checks to make purchases at a shop in Niter\u00f3i, a city outside of Rio de Janeiro on June 17, 2008, according to court documents. When making the purchase, he used an ID card with the checkbook owner\u2019s name and a picture of himself, according to police documents.\n\nPolice summoned Santos several times in 2008, 2009 and 2010 to speak to them. Santos\u2019 mother told the police in November 2010 that the checks were stolen from a checkbook she had in her purse belonging to Delio da Camara da Costa Alemao, who died a year prior to her speaking with police, and that her son had used four checks. Santos\u2019 mother was Costa Alemao\u2019s nurse prior to his death.\n\nSpeaking with the police for the first time that month, Santos confessed he stole the checkbook from his mom\u2019s purse and that he used \u201csome sheets\u201d to make purchases. Santos confessed to forging the man\u2019s signature on two checks to purchase clothes and shoes costing approximately $1,313.63 on the date of the forgery, and confirmed it was his signature on the forged checks.\n\nHe also told police he was an American with dual citizenship, was White and a professor, police documents show.\n\nSantos said his mother, who only learned of the stolen checks around a month after he took them, asked him \u201cwith despair\u201d to return the checkbook, but he had already ripped up the remaining checks and threw them in a manhole.\n\n\u201cHe [Santos] acknowledged having been responsible for forging the signatures on the checks, also confirming that he had destroyed the remaining checks,\u201d authorities wrote in an inquiry report about Santos. The document containing the confession was signed by Santos on November 18, 2010.\n\nCNN has reached out to an attorney for Santos.\n\nSuspicious checks\n\nSantos signed two checks at the store as if he was the account owner, court documents show. The checks were intended to pay for the purchase in two installments \u2013 set for July 25 and August 25, 2008.\n\nThe store clerk became suspicious after the signatures on the checks did not match, he told police. Two days after Santos made the purchases, a man named Thiago came into the same store with the shoes Santos had purchased and tried to return them for a different size. He said a friend gave him the shoes and was unaware of any illicit activity.\n\nThe clerk had to pay the amount of the fraudulent purchase in installments to the store, he told police, although the store ended up waving some of the payments for the clerk, the store manager told the police in 2010. Soon after the sale, they were able to find the bank account\u2019s owner and talk to him on the phone, the manager said. He said he had closed the account in 2006 after losing the checkbook.\n\nAt one point the clerk was able to track down Santos using social media and, he said, Santos promised to pay him back but never did. The clerk turned over pictures of Santos to police that he had found on social media. Screenshots of the conversations between the clerk and Santos are included in the documents obtained by CNN.\n\nSantos told investigators that neither his mother, nor his friend Thiago, were aware of the fraudulent purchases at the time of the crime.\n\nEfforts to find Santos\n\nIn June 2011, investigators filed a request with the Civil Police to take immediate judicial measures against Santos. In September, a judge summoned him to respond to the complaint through an attorney. Neither Santos nor an attorney ever responded. Three months later, authorities tried to deliver a summons for Santos at the prior home of his mother but he was not able to be located and she no longer lived there.\n\nAgain in 2013, neither Santos, nor his mother or grandmother at their former addresses, were able to be located. In October of that year, an edict was published in Rio de Janeiro\u2019s justice gazette summoning him to appear in court after authorities were unable to locate him. Santos was given 10 days to offer his defense but he never appeared. A judge eventually suspended the statute of limitations in order for the case to be reopened later if Santos was found, the documents show.\n\nAs recently as October 2020, a document from the judiciary said they still had never been able to locate Santos to prosecute him for the crime.\n\nBrazilian authorities, having now verified Santos\u2019 location, will make a formal request to the US Justice Department to notify Santos of the charges, Maristela Pereira, a spokeswoman for the Rio de Janeiro prosecutor\u2019s office, told CNN. The prosecutor\u2019s office told CNN the request will be filed upon reopening on Friday.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Post last week, Santos denied that he had been charged with any crime in Brazil, saying: \u201cI am not a criminal here \u2013 not here or in Brazil or any jurisdiction in the world. Absolutely not. That didn\u2019t happen.\u201d", "label": "human"}

{"text": "U.S. President Joe Biden speaks about U.S.-Mexico border security and enforcement, in the Roosevelt Room at the White House in Washington, U.S., January 5, 2023.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is heading to the U.S.-Mexico border on Sunday, his first trip there as president after two years of hounding by Republicans who have hammered him as soft on border security while the number of migrants crossing spirals.\n\nBiden is due to spend a few hours in El Paso, Texas, currently the biggest corridor for illegal crossings, due in large part to Nicaraguans fleeing repression, crime and poverty in their country. They are among migrants from four countries who are now subject to quick expulsion under new rules enacted by the Biden administration in the past week.\n\nThe president is expected to meet with border officials to discuss migration as well as the increased trafficking of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, which are driving skyrocketing numbers of overdoses in the U.S.\n\nBiden will visit the El Paso County Migrant Services Center and meet with nonprofits and religious groups that support migrants arriving to the U.S. It is not clear whether Biden will talk to any migrants.\n\n\"The president's very much looking forward to seeing for himself firsthand what the border security situation looks like,\" said John Kirby, White House national security spokesman. \"This is something that he wanted to see for himself.\"\n\nBiden's announcement on border security and his visit to the border are aimed in part at quelling the political noise and blunting the impact of upcoming investigations into immigration promised by House Republicans. But any enduring solution will require action by the sharply divided Congress, where multiple efforts to enact sweeping changes have failed in recent years.\n\nRepublican Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John Cornyn of Texas offered faint praise for Biden's decision to visit the border, and even that was notable in the current political climate.\n\n\"He must take the time to learn from some of the experts I rely on the most, including local officials and law enforcement, landowners, nonprofits, U.S. Customs and Border Protection's officers and agents, and folks who make their livelihoods in border communities on the front lines of his crisis,\" Cornyn said.\n\nFrom El Paso, Biden will continue south to Mexico City, where he and the leaders of Mexico and Canada will gather on Monday and Tuesday for a North American leaders summit. Immigration is among the items on the agenda.\n\nIn El Paso, where migrants congregate at bus stops and in parks before traveling on, border patrol agents have stepped up security before Biden's visit.\n\n\"I think they're trying to send a message that they're going to more consistently check people's documented status, and if you have not been processed they are going to pick you up,\" said Ruben Garcia of the Annunciation House aid group in El Paso.\n\nMigrants and asylum-seekers fleeing violence and persecution have increasingly found that protections in the United States are available primarily to those with money or the savvy to find someone to vouch for them financially.\n\nJose Natera, a Venezuelan migrant in El Paso who hopes to seek asylum in Canada, said he has no prospects for finding a U.S. sponsor and that he's now reluctant to seek asylum in the U.S. because he's afraid of being sent to Mexico.\n\nMexico \"is a terrible country where there is crime, corruption, cartels and even the police persecute you,\" he said. \"They say that people who think about entering illegally won't have a chance, but at the same time I don't have a sponsor. \u2026 I came to this country to work. I didn't come here to play.\"\n\nThe numbers of migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border has risen dramatically during Biden's first two years in office. There were more than 2.38 million stops during the year that ended Sept. 30, the first time the number topped 2 million. The administration has struggled to clamp down on crossings, reluctant to take hard-line measures that would resemble those of the Trump administration.\n\nThe policy changes announced this past week are Biden's biggest move yet to contain illegal border crossings and will turn away tens of thousands of migrants arriving at the border. At the same time, 30,000 migrants per month from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela will get the chance to come to the U.S. legally as long as they travel by plane, get a sponsor and pass background checks.\n\nThe U.S. will also turn away migrants who do not seek asylum first in a country they traveled through en route to the U.S.\n\nThe changes were welcomed by some, particularly leaders in cities where migrants have been massing. But Biden was excoriated by immigrant advocate groups, which accused him of taking measures modeled after those of the former president.\n\n\"I do take issue with comparing us to Donald Trump,\" said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, pointing to some of his most maligned policies, including the separation of migrant children from their parents.\n\n\"This is not that president,\" she said.\n\nFor all of his international travel over his 50 years in public service, Biden has not spent much time at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe only visit that the White House could point to was Biden's drive by the border while he was campaigning for president in 2008. He sent Vice President Kamala Harris to El Paso in 2021, but she was criticized for largely bypassing the action, because El Paso wasn't the center of crossings that it is now.\n\nPresident Barack Obama made a 2011 trip to El Paso, where he toured border operations and the Paso Del Norte international bridge, but he was later criticized for not going back as tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors crossed into the U.S. from Mexico.\n\nTrump, who made hardening immigration a signature issue, traveled to the border several times. During one visit, he crammed into a small border station to inspect cash and drugs confiscated by agents. During a trip to McAllen, Texas, then the center of a growing crisis, he made one of his most-often repeated claims, that Mexico would pay to build a border wall.\n\nAmerican taxpayers ended up footing the bill after Mexican leaders flatly rejected the idea.\n\n\"NO,\" Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, then Mexico's president, tweeted in May 2018. \"Mexico will NEVER pay for a wall. Not now, not ever. Sincerely, Mexico (all of us).\"", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Venezuela's economy is in a precarious state, with inflation rates soaring to 4,115% in the past year, according to the latest data from the Venezuelan Central Bank. This alarming rate is nearly double the previous month's rate and far exceeds the central bank's target of 3,000%. The country is struggling to implement a rescue plan, and economists warn that the situation is spiraling out of control.\n\nThe Maduro government has introduced measures to try and halt the hyperinflation, including price controls and increased interest rates. However, experts say these efforts will not be enough to stop the country's economic collapse. In fact, some predict that inflation could reach as high as 10,000% this year.\n\nThe economic crisis is having a devastating impact on the country, with food shortages, skyrocketing prices, and a currency collapse. The bolivar is now worth only a fraction of its pre-crisis value, making it difficult for Venezuelans to access basic goods and services.\n\nThe ongoing political crisis, including sanctions imposed by the US and other countries, has further exacerbated the situation. The sanctions have weakened the government's ability to fund itself and the economy, making it even harder for the government to manage its fiscal and monetary policies.\n\nEconomists are urging the government to implement policies that will lead to economic growth and stability, while also addressing the humanitarian crisis. They emphasize the need for economic reforms, increased supply of basic goods, and provision of basic services to the population.\n\nThe future of Venezuela remains uncertain, but economists say that with the right policies, the country can still avoid a return to hyperinflation and start on a path to recovery.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Malaysia's election outcome, a conservative leader chosen, has surprised many analysts, potentially leading to less economic progress and more conservative policies.\n\nVoters selected Muhyiddin Yassin as their Prime Minister, defeating the progressive Pakatan Harapan (PH) alliance, who were in power at the time of the election. This may result in a return to more conservative policies, while continuing with previous initiatives.\n\n\"It's a bit of a surprise to us,\" said Nur Jazlan Mohamed, an MP and former Deputy Home Minister for the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition. The results show a reversal from the 2018 polls, which saw a shift towards progressive politics when the PH coalition took power.\n\nThe BN's victory was not definitive, as it will need to contend with opposition from both sides of the political spectrum to maintain power. The coalition holds a reduced majority in the Malaysian parliament and faces challenges in implementing policies.\n\nThe Perikatan Nasional (PN) coalition, a group of Islamic fundamentalist parties, also played a role in the election. These parties sought to appeal to religious voters with more hardline policies and rhetoric.\n\nMany experts believed that the PN coalition's effort would draw support away from the PH. However, this did not seem to be the case.\n\nThe BN's ability to win a slim majority despite the presence of the PN coalition suggests that voters chose the BN as the most capable party to lead the country.\n\n\"I think the voters decided that Muhyiddin and BN were the most stable option and were the most likely to last through the next couple of years,\" said James Chin, a political scientist from the University of Tasmania.\n\nDespite the victory for the BN, analysts said there would be little room for significant change in Malaysia. The lack of a clear-cut majority in the parliament means that the coalition will need to be cautious when implementing policies or introducing changes.\n\n\"The government will be walking a tightrope here,\" said Thanaletchimi Subramaniam, a former election commission director.\n\nAnalysts did not see the BN's victory as a step backwards for Malaysia. Nur Jazlan said it was important for the nation to have a stable government that could make decisions and push them through.\n\n\"I think what we need now is a steady and cohesive government that can look after the people and still get the nation back on track,\" he said.\n\nThe BN is likely to continue most of the initiatives taken by the previous PH coalition, albeit at a slower pace.\n\nOverall, the Malaysian election appears to have come down to a choice between stability and progress. The votes cast on Saturday suggest that Malaysians erred on the side of conservatism, choosing stability over radical change.\n\nHowever, this doesn't mean that Malaysia's progress will come to a standstill. Analysts believe that the BN, with its slim majority and need to win support from both sides of the political spectrum, will be able to effect some moderate change, if not rapid development, in the coming years.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "There exist three critical cardiovascular disorders that frequently get mixed up, but have significant distinctions. Cardiac cessation, myocardial infarction, and cardiac insufficiency all share a common underlying cause - diseases of the heart muscle - but the way each condition impacts the body and the available treatments are quite distinct.\n\nCardiac cessation is a sudden loss of heart function. It occurs when electrical signals in the heart's electrical system become chaotic, causing the heart to abruptly stop pumping blood to the body and brain. In cardiac cessation, the heart ceases to function without warning, often without any pain or preceding symptoms. Cardiac cessation is a life-threatening emergency that requires immediate medical attention.\n\nMyocardial infarction, or heart attack, is when a section of the heart muscle stops receiving sufficient blood and oxygen. This typically occurs due to a blockage in the coronary artery, which supplies blood to the heart. A heart attack can cause chest pain or discomfort and can even be fatal if not treated in a timely manner.\n\nCardiac insufficiency is when the heart is unable to pump sufficient blood and oxygen to the body. Cardiac insufficiency can be caused by a range of conditions, such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, obesity, and diabetes. Symptoms of cardiac insufficiency include shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs, ankles, and feet.\n\nAll three conditions can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. However, the treatment for each condition will depend on the type and severity of the condition. Treatment for cardiac cessation often involves an electrical shock called defibrillation to help restore a normal heartbeat. Myocardial infarction treatment may involve clot-dissolving medications, surgery, or other treatments to restore blood flow to the heart. Cardiac insufficiency treatment often involves lifestyle modifications, such as diet and exercise, as well as medications and surgery.\n\nWhen it comes to managing any of these cardiovascular disorders, it is essential to understand the differences between them and to pay attention to your symptoms. If you experience any of the signs or symptoms of these conditions, seek medical attention immediately. Knowing the differences between these cardiovascular disorders can help you recognize the signs and symptoms and receive the necessary care.", "label": "machine"}

It was a textbook piece of union-busting that has also been tried at other Activision studios going through the process of unionisation.\n\nIn this case it hasn\u2019t worked; the NLRB\u2019s ruling today clears the path for the workers to vote on forming a union, disagreeing (in a detailed breakdown explaining how work differs between each of the studio\u2019s departments, and how underpaid testers are) with Activision\u2019s claims that, \u201cwe believe every employee in Albany who works on Diablo should have a direct say in this decision.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ruling concludes:\n\nBased on the above, I conclude that the employees in the petitioned-for unit share a community of interest. I have also considered the similarities that exist among the developers and compared this to the testers. Developers are organized in separate departments, but departments that ultimately report to the head of the Diablo franchise. Developers have a diverse set of skills, training, and duties, but use these skills in a complementary manner in a production process that includes significant amount of contact and a high degree of functional integration. Compensation varies, but many terms and conditions of employment do have overlap among the developers. Comparing the developers\u2019 community of interest to that of the testers I find that the distinct interests of the testers outweigh the similarities that exist with the developers. As noted, the testers participate in the same game development process that includes significant contact and functional integration. However, testers are separately organized in their own department and their supervisory hierarchy is entirely separate from the Diablo franchise. Testers also have a specific set of skills and duties different from the developers. Finally, testers are paid significantly less than developers. Moreover, the evidence of interchange between testers and developers is extremely limited. For these reasons I find any shared interests between the testers and developers do not outweigh the separate interests that make the petitioned-for unit an appropriate unit.\n\nThe ruling instantly clears the path for an election, which will begin soon. Ballots will be sent out on October 27, with votes being counted on November 18.\n\nA current employee at the studio, though not one of the testers involved in the vote, told the Washington Post, \u201cIt\u2019s about time. Our QA testers are some of the most talented and skilled people working in our company and they are critically undervalued by corporate. I think that all games workers need a union, but QA is in especially dire need.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUpdate 10:00pm ET: Lulu Cheng Meservey, Activision Blizzard\u2019s \u2018executive vice president, corporate affairs and chief communications officer\u2019, has responded to the finding on internal communications, writing:\n\nHey all, quick heads up on something important. It\u2019s a long one but wanna be thorough so thanks for bearing with me. This afternoon the NLRB (national labor relations board) determined that -20 QA (quality assurance) testers working on Diablo in Albany will be eligible to form a union and if the union wins the vote will be included in the bargaining unit. Where the company stands on that: fully respects the NLRB process, and fully supports the employees\u2019 right to choose how they want to be represented. Also has the view that people who work closely together should be able to make decisions like that collectively - ie, we disagree that a handful of employees should get to decide for everyone else on the future of the entire Albany-based Diablo team. We think a direct dialogue between company and employees is the most productive route. Examples: through direct dialogue we\u2019ve already converted contingent QA staff to full time, increased pay, increased benefits, opened up access to the bonus program, and offered more opportunities for professional advancement (which would also result in more pay). We feel collective bargaining is comparatively slow- once agreement is in place takes over a year on average according to a Bloomberg analysis. During the long contract negotiation, companies are forbidden from giving any pay/bonus/benefi t increases without a special arrangement with the union, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that non-union employees generally get larger pay raises than union-represented groups. That\u2019s consistent with what we saw with Raven, where there have only been three bargaining sessions since the union was certified there almost 6 months ago, due partly to the union cancelling pre-planned bargaining sessions for a month. I\u2019m sharing all of that because having a streamlined process is a reason why the company prefers direct discussions - but ultimately it\u2019s up to employees and everyone should get to vote their own preference in a fair election. What happens next with this is that ballots will be mailed to eligible Albany-based employees on Oct. 27, need to be returned by Nov. 17, and will get counted by the NLRB on Nov. 18. More to come as the process continues but wanted to share asap. Thanks so much for reading everyone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUpdate 11/2/22 12:33 p.m. ET: Activision is now appealing the decision with the NLRB and calling on it to stop the vote in the meantime. Specifically, the company wants the votes that were already sent to employees\u2019 homes to be \u201cimpounded\u201d until the appeal is completed, lest any preliminary results \u201cprejudice\u201d a future vote in the event that Activision wins the appeal.\n\nThe company argues that video game development is unique and unprecedented compared to other industries the NLRB has dealt with, and for that reason its original decision was flawed and based on several misunderstandings. As just one example, Activision insinuates that the development of Diablo is much more complex than Call of Duty, and therefore teams at Blizzard Albany are much more integrated than those at Raven, where Activision\u2019s legal arguments previously failed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear the company\u2019s executives feel threatened by workers organizing in New York, Wisconsin and across the country,\u201d responded CWA Secretary-Treasurer Sara Steffens in a statement. \u201cWe are confident in the NLRB\u2019s response to these frivolous requests, and we will continue to push for Activision Blizzard employees\u2019 right to organize without delay.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUpdate 11/2/22 2:55 p.m. ET: Activision spokesperson Rich George provided the following statement:", "label": "human"}

To ensure our listed platforms were legit, we considered many things, including tie-ups with top credit bureaus.\n\nA poor credit score is often why people cannot get hold of loans to take care of their different needs. Our ranking factors have been decided to keep in mind the needs of everyone.\n\nCredit Score Requirement\n\nA minimum credit score requirement often prevents people from getting loans through traditional sources. However, we discovered platforms that connect you with personal loan lenders ready to credit money into your bank account without considering your credit scores.\n\nYou do not have to maintain a minimum credit score to be able to borrow significant amounts from the many lenders who are available on these platforms dedicated to helping you out. The online lender does not care about your credit scores, and we have listed only those platforms with no minimum credit score needed to borrow cash. Your credit report doesn\u2019t matter either.\n\nLoan Amount Offered\n\nThe loan amount that you can borrow is one of the major deciding factors for deciding which platforms work. You should be able to get flexible loan amounts from the providers. We have selected platforms that offer different loan amount options ranging from very low to very high. On one platform, you can get a loan amount of up to $50,000 in a single day.\n\nThe flexibility of the loan amounts is something that we look for. We looked for personal loan lenders who can give you a loan amount as low as $100 if that\u2019s all you need. Usually, it is difficult to get a high loan amount if you have a poor credit score. However, using the platforms we have listed, you can get auto loans in the loan amount you want directly in your bank account.\n\nInterest Rates\n\nThe interest rates must be reasonable and negotiable to worry about the monthly payment and not bother much about how much you need to repay due to excessive interest rates. We selected those platforms where the personal loan lenders charged reasonable interest rates against the loan amount you borrowed.\n\nWhether the amount you borrow is towards your debt consolidation loans or anything else, they have to be reasonable when comparing interest rates. Interest rates were among the most important deciding factors when renting with the different platforms.\n\nLoan Types Offered \u2013 Secured vs. Unsecured\n\nThe loan types offered also had to be taken into consideration, and we preferred those platforms that offered maximum unsecured loan sizes and those personal loan lenders who were ready to give a high secured loan amount as well as unsecured personal loans that you can use as you need to take care of your personal expenses.\n\nIrrespective of your credit score, you should be able to get hold of different types of loans, including unsecured ones, and we made sure that our platforms offered you enough options for the same. You can use these loans to repay your credit card debt.\n\nLoan Options Available\n\nThe loan options available are an essential criterion for deciding which platform is right for you. The availability of different loan options is critical because you require different types of loans. Sometimes, you require debt consolidation loans to cover your current needs.\n\nWhether for a credit card or a simple debt consolidation loan, or a payday loan for bad credit that you want to use for other personal needs, it is essential to have multiple loan options available without any credit check procedures. Our platforms are ready to offer you all kinds of loans, including auto loans, without any credit check procedures or hassles of the strict monthly payment.\n\nDocumentation Requirements and Credit Check\n\nWe ensured that the documentation requirements were minimal in the selected platforms for you. A soft credit check is all you will have to go through to get money from the personal loan lenders on these platforms.\n\nThe credit check procedures are relatively simple. A soft credit check replaces the need for extensive documentation for the online lender to decide whether they can give you the money to repay your credit card debt and other necessities.\n\nYou will be able to connect with direct lenders, in fact, many lenders through the platforms that we have listed out for you, and get hold of money with elementary and straightforward credit check procedures.\n\nOrigination Fees Required\n\nYou should be able to get hold of personal loans without paying much money in origination fees. We kept this in mind when we selected the platforms, and we gave reference to those that did not charge an origination fee.\n\nWe preferred those fair credit platforms that connected you with direct lenders without charging you too much in the name of origination fees. We understand that when you are looking for a loan with bad credit, the last thing you want to be bothered with is a high origination fee.\n\nSpeed of Deposit\n\nThe origination fee is not the only thing that matters. Even if you pay a minimal origination fee, the priority is that the money must be credited into your bank account as soon as possible. When comparing bad credit personal loans, the deposit speed is something that we took pretty seriously.\n\nThe companies that offered the best personal loans ensured that the loan with bad credit was immediately deposited. The companies that provide the best personal loans ensure that the loan with bad credit is immediately deposited into your bank. Just as important as everything else is how you get hold of the personal loans for your various needs.\n\nTies With Credit Bureaus\n\nPlatforms offering personal loans seem to have more validation and accountability if associated with reliable major credit bureaus. Major credit bureaus add credibility to the platforms that give you loans despite having poor credit scores.\n\nA great way to secure a safe loan with fair credit without much of a credit check is to ensure that the platform offering your personal loans is associated with any major bureaus, but this is not the same as a credit union.\n\nRepayment Terms\n\nEven if you have poor credit scores, you should be able to get a loan with bad credit that offers you flexibility when it comes to repayment. We considered those platforms that did not care much about your debt to income ratio and put together personal loan options that can be repaid in the terms you are comfortable with.\n\nMost Bad Credit Loan Companies offer what Types Of Loans?\n\nSeveral types of loans are available to you, depending on your needs and financial situation. Some of the most common include:\n\nPersonal Loans\n\nIf you need money for an emergency or unexpected expense, a personal loan is probably what you\u2019re looking for. Personal loans can be used for anything from home improvements to medical bills. They also offer flexible repayment terms, so you won\u2019t worry about paying back too much.\n\nBanks and credit unions typically offer personal loans. You will likely be asked to provide proof of income and assets such as bank statements, pay stubs, tax returns, etc.\n\nHome Improvement Loans\n\nA home improvement loan will help you pay for repairs or renovations that improve the overall value of your property. These loans usually require a down payment, but they may allow you to finance up to 80% of the project cost. You can use these funds to install new appliances, build a deck, replace windows, paint rooms, etc. Home improvement loans often come with long-term repayment options, making them ideal for people who want to save money over time.\n\nConstruction Loans\n\nConstruction loans are used to construct additions to your home or repair damage caused by natural disasters. Remodeling loans are used to overhaul your home completely. Construction loans typically require larger down payments than other types of loans. If you don\u2019t qualify for a construction loan, you can still apply for a remodeling loan. This type of loan allows you to borrow between 50%-80% of the total project cost.\n\nHard Money Loans \u2013 This type of loan requires no documentation and is typically only offered by real estate investors. It allows you to borrow more than $25,000 without putting any collateral down.\n\nRenovation Loans \u2013 This hard money loan is designed to help homeowners renovate their properties. It is similar to a remodel loan, except it doesn\u2019t require as large of a down payment.\n\nRenovations loans are perfect if you don\u2019t have enough cash to cover all of the costs associated with a significant renovation. If you need to borrow money for a big project like this, a renovation loan might be right for you.\n\nCar Repairs & Maintenance Loans\n\nWhether you need to repair your car or just maintain it, a car maintenance loan can help you get the work done without a second mortgage. This type of loan allows you to finance 100% of the vehicle\u2019s cost. It typically comes with a short term (usually one year) and a longer-term (3 years).\n\nCar repair loans are outstanding if you need to fix something immediately. Most lenders will accept a damaged vehicle as security for a loan, but you should always check with your lender before taking this route. It is important to note that some lenders may not consider a damaged vehicle acceptable security.\n\nStudent Loan Refinancing\n\nRefinancing your student loans can be a great way to reduce your monthly payments. However, refinancing isn\u2019t always possible. Your credit score and other factors play into whether or not you qualify for a refinance. If you do qualify, you may be able to lower your interest rate by 0.5%.\n\nIf you\u2019re a student, you might be able to borrow money through a federal student loan program. There are two main types of federal student loans \u2013 Stafford and Perkins. These programs allow you to borrow money based on how much you earn each month. If you\u2019re not currently working, you could apply for either of these loans to cover school expenses such as tuition costs, books, and other living expenses.\n\nPrivate Student Loans\n\nPrivate student loans are an alternative to federal student loans. They are generally easier to obtain than federal loans because they are based on your income rather than your credit history. The downside is that private student loans tend to carry higher interest rates.\n\nWhen choosing between private and federal student loans, it is best to choose the one that fits your needs. For example, if you plan to attend school full-time, a private student loan would be better suited. On the other hand, a federal student loan would be good if you plan to go part-time.\n\nBusiness Loans\n\nA small business loan might be right for you if you own a business. Many small businesses don\u2019t qualify for traditional bank financing because their credit isn\u2019t strong enough. However, many alternative funding sources are available to business owners like you. A business loan can provide you with the capital you need to grow your company. Most business loans require collateral to secure the loan, such as inventory or equipment.\n\nThese loans are designed to help businesses grow by providing capital to fund growth initiatives. Small business loans are available in increments ranging between $5,000 and $100,000. You may qualify for a more significant amount than this depending on your credit history.\n\nThere are different types of small business loans. These include:\n\nTerm loans \u2013 These loans have fixed terms, usually from 2 to 5 years. You pay back the principal plus interest over the loan term.\n\nRevolving loans \u2013 These loans are also known as a line of credit loans. You make a single payment at the beginning of the loan period and continue making regular payments throughout the life of the loan. This type of loan is ideal for purchasing new equipment or buying inventory.\n\nEquipment loans \u2013 An equipment loan is used to finance purchases of equipment.\n\nWorking Capital Loans \u2013 These loans are used to finance short-term cash flow needs.\n\nYou should consider all of your options before deciding which type of loan will work best for your business.\n\nReverse Mortgage Loan\n\nA reverse mortgage loan lets homeowners age 62 and older draw cash from their homes. Reverse mortgages generally don\u2019t require monthly payments, with few exceptions. For example, if you live in a house worth less than $500,000, you will likely have to pay taxes on any equity you receive.\n\nThe interest rate on a reverse mortgage loan is typically fixed, meaning that it doesn\u2019t change throughout the life of the loan. The loan size depends on several factors, including the borrower\u2019s age, the property\u2019s appraised value, and whether the borrower has other assets. In addition to the principal and interest, borrowers must pay closing costs when they close on the loan.\n\nDebt Consolidation Loans\n\nWhen you combine all your debts into one single debt, it makes it easier to manage. Debt consolidation loans let you consolidate multiple unsecured debts into one secured debt. This means that you only have to repay one lender instead of many. You should expect to see lower rates and fees when you consolidate your debt. You also have more flexibility when it comes to repaying your debt. Debt consolidation loans come in various forms, but most lenders offer an adjustable-rate option.\n\nIn addition to traditional loans, there are many different ways to consolidate debt. Debt consolidation lets you combine multiple debts into one low-interest loan. For example, you could incorporate several high-interest credit cards into one low-interest card. Consolidating your debt can save you thousands in interest charges each year.\n\nPawnshop Loans\n\nIf you need money quickly, you might be able to get a pawnshop loan. A pawn shop loan is similar to a payday loan because both provide fast access to funds. However, a pawnshop loan isn\u2019t based on your income. Instead, you borrow against the value of items you own. If you fail to repay your loan within 30 days, the object becomes the bank\u2019s collateral.\n\nPawnshop loans aren\u2019t available everywhere. Some states prohibit them entirely. Before applying for a pawnshop loan, check with local laws to ensure that this type of loan is legal where you live.\n\nHome Equity Line Of Credit (HELOC)\n\nA home equity line of credit allows you to tap into the equity in your home as needed. Home equity lines of credit are often referred to as \u201csecond mortgages.\u201d They allow you to use the equity in your home to make large purchases or cover unexpected expenses.\n\nFor example, suppose you want to buy a new car. Your current auto loan won\u2019t cover the total cost of a new vehicle. To cover the difference, you could take out a second mortgage. Or, you could apply for a home equity line of credit. With a HELOC, you would put down a small amount of money and add additional amounts.\n\nYou can usually choose how much you want to borrow. As long as you keep up with the required payments, you can continue borrowing as much as you need.\n\nPersonal Loan Refinancing\n\nRefinancing a personal loan is another way to reduce your monthly payment. Personal loans are designed to help you meet short-term financial needs such as paying off medical bills or buying furniture. Unlike a home equity line of credits, refinancing a personal loan involves taking out a new loan.\n\nRefinancing your personal loan may not always be possible. But if you do qualify, refinancing will likely result in a lower interest rate. It also allows you to pay less than what you originally borrowed.\n\nCredit Builder Loans\n\nMany people find themselves unable to obtain a traditional loan due to bad credit or limited credit history. In these cases, you may be eligible for a credit builder loan. These types of loans are designed to give you the chance to build good credit.\n\nTo qualify for a credit builder loan, you must first prove that you have a steady job. Then, you must show that you have been making regular payments on your existing debt. Finally, you must demonstrate that you have enough cash flow to handle missed payments.\n\nBefore you apply for a credit builder loan:\n\nMake sure you understand all terms and conditions.\n\nBe prepared to document your employment status and income.\n\nKnow whether you have an active bankruptcy or foreclosure case.\n\nYou should receive a credit builder loan approval within two weeks if you can complete the application process.\n\nBoat Loans\n\nIf you own a boat, you may be interested in obtaining financing through a private lender. You can use a boat loan to finance the purchase price of a used boat or to refinance an existing loan.\n\nIn addition to providing you with a low-interest rate, a boat loan offers some other benefits. For one thing, you don\u2019t have to worry about getting preapproved for a bank loan. If you qualify, you can get approved immediately. And because most lenders require only proof of ownership, it\u2019s easy to provide this documentation.\n\nWhen considering a boat loan, consider the following factors:\n\nThe size of the loan. Smaller loans tend to carry higher rates of interest.\n\nThe length of the loan term. A longer loan term means you will repay more over the life of the loan.\n\nWhether you plan to make a sizeable down payment, lenders generally prefer borrowers who make larger down payments.\n\nThe type of insurance coverage you desire. Boat owners often opt for comprehensive coverage. This includes liability insurance, which protects against accidents caused by the borrower. Comprehensive coverage also covers damage from theft or fire.\n\nRecreation Vehicle (RV) Loans\n\nA recreational vehicle (RV) loan provides you with the flexibility to buy a second home without selling your primary residence. With an RV loan, you can finance up to 80 percent of the cost of a new or used RV.\n\nAn RV loan has several advantages. First, you won\u2019t need to put 20 percent down when purchasing a new RV; instead, you can finance the entire amount using a personal loan. Second, you don\u2019t have to wait until you sell your house to purchase an RV. You can take out a loan while still living at your current address. Third, you can use an RV loan to finance the purchase price and the monthly payments. Fourth, you can use an auto loan to pay off your RV loan. Fifth, you can finance an RV even if you have poor credit.\n\nThe most significant disadvantage of an RV loan is its high-interest rate. Most lenders charge between 15 and 25 percent APR. However, you can negotiate a lower rate with a reputable lender.\n\nFamily Loans\n\nMany families are struggling financially these days. As a result, they turn to family members to help them meet their financial needs. Family loans offer several advantages. One advantage is that they are usually less expensive than traditional loans. Another advantage is that they allow you to borrow money without having to prove that you can afford repayment.\n\nThere are four types of family loans:\n\nHome equity lines of credit (HELOC). These loans enable you to tap into the equity in your home. They typically involve no pre-payment penalties.\n\nRevolving lines of credit. These loans allow you to borrow funds as long as you continue making regular payments. There is no limit on how much you can borrow.\n\nLines of credit secured by real estate. These loans are similar to revolving lines of credit. However, instead of borrowing against your property, they rely on your property as collateral.\n\nPersonal loans. These loans are designed to be repaid outside of bankruptcy.\n\nTo qualify for a family loan, you must provide proof of income. Typically, this involves providing copies of tax returns and bank statements. If you do not have adequate documentation, you may be able to get approved for a smaller loan.\n\nPool Loans\n\nIf you own a pool, it could be worth thousands of dollars. Some people spend more than $100,000 building their pools. Unfortunately, many homeowners find themselves unable to cover the costs of maintaining their pools. Pool loans are one way to solve this problem.\n\nPool loans are short-term loans that enable you to obtain financing for repairs, improvements, and maintenance. Unlike other forms of funding, pool loans require little paperwork. You need to fill out an application form and submit it to the lender. The lender will then evaluate your request based on the information provided in the application. After the lender approves your bid, you can begin repaying the loan.\n\nOne major drawback to pool loans is their high-interest rates. Many lenders charge up to 30 percent APR. However, some lenders offer lower rates.\n\nYou should also keep in mind that pool loans are often limited to certain types of pools. For example, most lenders only approve pool loans for above-ground pools. You cannot use a pool loan to repair or maintain an in-ground pool.\n\nYou might consider applying for a pool loan before building your pool. This will give you time to save enough money to pay off the loan. Once you have paid off the loan, you can use the proceeds to make any needed repairs or improvements.\n\nIs There A Minimum Credit Score Requirement To Get A Loan on Bad Credit?\n\nIdeally, there is no minimum credit score amount that should determine how much money you should be able to borrow. This applies to the loan amount you can get without worrying about your credit report. The minimum credit score doesn\u2019t matter to any platform we have listed, but interest rates may vary if you are below credit unions\u2019 minimum credit score needs. Your credit report doesn\u2019t affect the loan amount.\n\nWhy Would You Possibly Need A Personal Loan?\n\nUsing the money you get from the online lender in your bank account is entirely up to you. We know that it is tough for you to get a personal loan from a financial institution when you have a poor credit history.\n\nHere are some suggestions on using personal loans to cover various expenses that you might encounter.

It will be like a second mortgage on your home. These loan amounts can repay existing debt at reasonable interest rates.\n\nDebt Consolidation Loans\n\nDebt consolidation is one of the most common reasons people take a personal loan from the listed platforms. You can get debt consolidation loans specifically or use personal loans for debt consolidation and take care of your pending expenses.\n\nThe debt consolidation loan amounts you get from these platforms are pretty high, and you can get a good loan amount at decent interest rates from reliable lenders.\n\nEmergency Cost\n\nIf you have to consolidate debt immediately and borrow money for this purpose, then the personal loan amounts from these platforms can help you with the same.

You can get a personal loan as a bad credit loan irrespective of your debt to income ratio from lending partners who offer fair credit even if you have a poor credit history.\n\nSecured Personal Loans Vs.

You can get a secured loan amount from platforms that offer loans for bad credit.\n\nUnderstanding An Unsecured Loan\n\nAn unsecured personal loan is a type of loan that you get without having to produce collateral.

{"text": "A renowned vocalist, Miley Cyrus, is poised to release a new single, \"You Get What You Give,\" in commemoration of her former spouse, Liam Hemsworth, who is celebrating his 32nd birthday on Saturday.\n\nThe track, set to drop on Friday (Jan. 8), will feature on Cyrus' forthcoming seventh studio album, Plastic Hearts. In a statement accompanying the release, the artist explained the significance of releasing the song on Hemsworth's birthday.\n\n\"Hemsworth has always held a special place in my life,\" she stated. \"He has played a vital role in shaping me into the person I am today, and I'm incredibly proud of the individuals we have both become. To celebrate his birthday and our enduring friendship, I wanted to create a special song dedicated to him.\"\n\nThe song marks the first time the ex-partners have collaborated on a project since their separation in August 2019. It is also the first time they have publicly collaborated since the release of their duet, \"Wrecking Ball,\" in 2013.\n\nThe two initially connected in 2009 and made their red-carpet debut as a couple at the 2010 premiere of The Last Song. They became engaged in 2012 but called off the engagement the following year. They eventually reconciled and got married in December 2018.\n\nIn October 2019, Cyrus and Hemsworth filed for divorce after months of speculation that their marriage was on shaky ground. Since then, both stars have publicly addressed the split.\n\n\"I think I'm a bit more aware of what's not working and what's not the right situation for me,\" Cyrus told Elle in a January 2020 cover story. She also mentioned, \"There are good people with good hearts out there. I know that. I just have to find them.\"\n\nIn his own statement following the divorce, Hemsworth said, \"Change is inevitable. The only thing we can do is work together to make the best of it.

In the single, Cyrus sings, \"The past keeps calling, but I just keep on dancing,\" an ode to her newfound freedom and embracing her \"plastic heart.\"\n\nThe single is an unexpected turn of events for the former couple. After their divorce, the pair remained friendly, with Cyrus expressing her respect for Hemsworth in various interviews.\n\n\"Liam and I are still very close,\" she said on an episode of the Joe Rogan Experience. \"We're still very close and just because we're not in a romantic relationship doesn't take away from the fact that we're still very, very close and we still love each other and we're always going to be in each other's lives.\"\n\n\"You Get What You Give\" marks an exciting new chapter for both Cyrus and Hemsworth, and fans are eagerly anticipating the release.

{"text": "International stocks, but especially emerging market stocks \u2014 and most notably emerging market value stocks \u2014 offer the greatest likelihood of outperforming large and small stocks in the U.S. over the next seven years, even after adjusting for inflation, according to the latest monthly projection from Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo & Co.\n\nEmerging market value stocks are likely to return a real 9% per annum over the next seven years, while emerging market stocks as a whole are forecast to return 5.2% a year. International small-cap stocks are projected to return a real 4.5% while international large-cap stocks come in at 2.4% a year, after inflation.\n\nThe U.S. isn't forecast to keep up, with U.S. small caps projected to shrink 1.4% each year after inflation, and U.S. large caps estimated to fall an average 1.8% annually over seven years.\n\nSimilarly, emerging market debt is likely to end up as the best-performing fixed-income class, returning a real 3.5% annually, followed by U.S. cash at +0.8%, U.S. inflation-linked bonds at 0.3%.

{"text": "The jobs market closed out 2022 on a high note, with companies adding far more positions than expected in December, payroll processing firm ADP reported Thursday.\n\nPrivate payrolls rose by 235,000 for the month, well ahead of the 153,000 Dow Jones estimate and the 127,000 initially reported for November.\n\nWhile the goods-producing sector increased by a relatively meager 22,000, service providers added 213,000, led by leisure and hospitality, which added 123,000 positions. Professional and business services grew by 52,000, while education and health services added 42,000.\n\nStock market futures edged lower following the report as investors fear that strong jobs numbers could push the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates.\n\nThe big jobs surprise comes despite the Federal Reserve's attempts to slow a sizzling jobs market that has helped push inflation to near its highest level in more than 40 years.\n\nThe central bank raised interest rates seven times in 2022, totaling 4.25 percentage points, and officials have identified labor market imbalances as a pivotal area they want to target. There are still about 1.7 job openings for every available worker, a condition that has led to a spike in wages that nevertheless has failed to keep pace with cost-of-living increases.\n\nADP reported that annual pay across all categories rose 7.3% from a year ago, led by a 10.1% increase in the pivotal leisure and hospitality industry.\n\n\"The labor market is strong but fragmented, with hiring varying sharply by industry and establishment size,\" ADP's chief economist, Nela Richardson, said. \"Business segments that hired aggressively in the first half of 2022 have slowed hiring and in some cases cut jobs in the last month of the year.\"\n\nTrade, transportation and utilities saw a job loss of 24,000 on the month, while natural resources and mining declined 14,000 and financial activities dropped by 12,000. Other notable gainers by sector included professional and business services (52,000), education and health services (42,000) and construction (41,000).\n\nJob gains were evenly distributed between small- and medium-sized businesses, which together added 386,000 workers. Companies with more than 500 employees reported a drop of 151,000.\n\nThe job gains cap off a year in which payroll growth averaged nearly 300,000 a month, according to the ADP data, which can differ substantially from the Labor Department's official nonfarm payrolls count.\n\nThat growth has come even with an economy that saw negative growth in the first two quarters \u2014 a widely accepted definition of a recession \u2014 and aggressive tightening from the Fed. At their December meeting, central banker policymakers said they plan to continue raising rates and don't anticipate any reductions at least through 2023, according to minutes released Wednesday.\n\nThe ADP report comes a day before the Labor Department's count, which is expected to show growth of 200,000 in nonfarm jobs and an unemployment rate holding steady at 3.7%.

These tips for being more secure in your online life will help keep you safer.\n\nWe call this type of software antivirus, but fending off actual computer viruses is just one small part of what they do. Ransomware encrypts your files and demands payment to restore them. Trojan horse programs seem like valid programs, but behind the scenes, they steal your private information. Bots turn your computer into a soldier in a zombie army, ready to engage in a denial-of-service attack, spew spam, or whatever the bot herder commands. An effective antivirus protects against these and many other kinds of malware.\n\nIt's Surprisingly Easy to Be More Secure Online It's Surprisingly Easy to Be More Secure Online\n\nIn theory, you can set and forget your antivirus protection, letting it hum along in the background, download updates, and so on. In practice, you should look it over every now and then. Most antivirus utilities display a green banner or icon when everything is hunky-dory. If you open the utility and see yellow or red, follow the instructions to get things back on track.\n\nYou may be thinking, wait, isn't antivirus built into Windows? Not only is Microsoft Defender baked into the operating system, it automatically takes over protection when it detects no other antivirus, and just as automatically steps aside when you install third-party protection. The thing is, this built-in antivirus just doesn't compare with the best third-party solutions. Even the best free ones are way better than Microsoft Defender. Don't rely on it; you can do better.\n\nWhether you've chosen a simple antivirus or a full security suite, you'll need to renew it every year. Your best bet is to enroll in automatic renewal. With some security products, doing so enables a malware-free guarantee. You can always opt-out later if you get the urge to switch to a different product.\n\n(Credit: PCMag)\n\nOne more thing. If your antivirus or security suite doesn't have ransomware protection, consider adding a separate layer of protection. Many ransomware-specific utilities are entirely free, so there's no reason not to try a few of them and select the one that suits you best.\n\nMany excellent apps and settings help protect your devices and your identity, but they're only valuable if you know how to use them properly. To get the maximum protective power from these tools, you must understand their features and settings. For example, your smartphone almost certainly includes an option to find it if lost, and you may have even turned it on. But did you actively try it out, so you'll know how to use it if needed?\n\nMost antivirus tools have the power to fend off Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUAs), troublesome apps that aren't exactly malware but don't do anything beneficial. But not all of them enable PUA detection by default. Check the detection settings and make sure yours are configured to block these annoyances. Likewise, your security suite may have components that aren't active until you turn them on. When you install a new security product, flip through all the pages of the main window, and at least take a glance at the settings. If it offers an initial onboarding tour, don\u2019t skip it\u2014rather, go through the tour methodically, paying attention to all the features.\n\nAntivirus tools usually include some form of browsing protection, typically in the form of a browser extension. If you accidentally try to visit a dangerous page or a phishing fraud, they divert the browser to a safe warning page. Many of them mark up search results so you don't even click on a dangerous link. And all this helps you not at all if you don't have the browser extension installed and working. Check each browser you use to make sure it's protected.\n\n(Credit: PCMag)\n\nTo be extra sure your antivirus is configured and working correctly, you can turn to the security features check(Opens in a new window) page on the website of the AMTSO (Anti-Malware Testing Standards Organization). If your antivirus doesn't pass, it's time to contact tech support and find out why.\n\n3. Use Unique Passwords for Every Login\n\nOne of the easiest ways hackers steal information is by getting a batch of username and password combinations from one source and trying those same combinations elsewhere. For example, let's say hackers got your username and password by hacking an email provider. They might try to log into banking sites or major online stores using the same username and password combination. The single best way to prevent one data breach from having a domino effect is to use a strong, unique password for every single online account you have.\n\nCreating a unique and strong password for every account is not a job for a human. That is why you use the random password generator built into your password manager. Several very good password managers are free, and it takes little time to start using one. For-pay password managers generally offer more features, however.\n\nWhen you use a password manager, the only password you need to remember is the master password that locks the password manager itself. When unlocked, the password manager logs you into your online accounts automatically. That not only helps keep you safer but also increases your efficiency and productivity. You no longer spend time typing your logins or dealing with the time-consuming frustration of resetting a forgotten password.\n\nOne more thing to consider. If you get creamed by a self-driving car tomorrow, how will your heirs manage to access your accounts? The most advanced password managers let you identify a password heir, someone who will receive access to your account after you shuffle off this mortal coil.\n\n4. Get a VPN and Use It\n\nAny time you connect to the Internet using a Wi-Fi network that you don't own, you should use a virtual private network or VPN. Say you go to a coffee shop and connect to a free Wi-Fi network. You don't know anything about the security of that connection. It's possible that someone else on that network, without you knowing, could start looking through or stealing the files and data sent from your laptop or mobile device. The hotspot owner might be a crook, sniffing out secrets from all Wi-Fi connections. A VPN encrypts your internet traffic, routing it through a server owned by the VPN company. That means nobody, not even the owner of the free Wi-Fi network, can snoop on your data.\n\nUsing a VPN also hides your IP address. Advertisers and trackers looking to identify or geolocate you via that IP address will instead see the VPN company's address. Spoofing your location using a VPN server in another country can also serve to unlock content that's not available in your own region. On a more serious note, journalists and activists in repressive countries have long used VPN technology to communicate securely.\n\nThe upshot is that if you connect via Wi-Fi\u2014whether it's on a laptop, phone, or tablet\u2014you really need a VPN. If you've never used one before, or the technology sounds a bit beyond your internet savvy, don't worry, we've got covered with our feature on how to set up and use a VPN.\n\n5. Use Multi-factor Authentication\n\nMulti-factor authentication can be a pain, but it absolutely makes your accounts more secure. Multi-factor authentication means you need to pass another layer of authentication, not just a username and password, to get into your accounts. If the data or personal information in an account is sensitive or valuable, and the account offers multi-factor authentication, you should enable it. Gmail, Evernote, and Dropbox are a few examples of online services that offer multi-factor authentication.\n\nWhat Is Two-Factor Authentication? What Is Two-Factor Authentication?\n\nMulti-factor authentication verifies your identity using at least two different forms of authentication: something you are, something you have, or something you know. Something you know is the password, naturally. Something you are could mean authentication using a fingerprint, or facial recognition. Something you have could be your mobile phone. You might be asked to enter a code sent via text or tap a confirmation button on a mobile app. Something you have could also be a physical Security Key; Google and Microsoft have announced a push toward this kind of authentication.\n\nIf you just use a password for authentication, anyone who learns that password owns your account. With multi-factor authentication enabled, the password alone is useless. Most password managers support multi-factor, though some only require it when they detect a connection from a new device. Enabling Multi-factor authentication for your password manager is a must.\n\nOur feature on who has Multi-factor authentication and how to set it up can help you get started.\n\n6. Use Passcodes Even When They Are Optional\n\nApply a passcode lock wherever available, even if it's optional. Think of all the personal data and connections on your smartphone. Going without a passcode lock is unthinkable.\n\n(Credit: PCMag)\n\nMany smartphones offer a four-digit PIN by default. Don't settle for that. Use biometric authentication when available, and set a strong passcode, not a stupid four-digit PIN. Remember, even when you use Touch ID or equivalent, you can still authenticate with the passcode, so it needs to be strong.\n\nModern iOS devices offer a six-digit option; ignore it. Go to Settings > Touch ID & Passcode and select Change Passcode (or Add Passcode if you don't have one). Enter your old passcode, if needed. On the screen to enter the new code, choose Custom Alphanumeric Code. Enter a strong password, then record it as a secure note in your password manager.\n\nDifferent Android devices offer different paths to setting a strong passcode. Find the Screen Lock settings on your device, enter your old PIN, and choose Password (if available). As with the iOS device, add a strong password and record it as a secure note.\n\n7. Pay With Your Smartphone\n\nThe system of credit card use is outdated and not very secure at all. That's not your fault, but there is something you can do about it. Instead of whipping out the old credit card, use Apple Pay or an Android equivalent everywhere you can. There are tons of choices when it comes to apps. In fact, we have an entire roundup of mobile payment apps.\n\nSetting up your smartphone as a payment device is typically a simple process. It usually starts with snapping a picture of the credit card that you'll use to back your app-based payments. And setup pretty much ends there; you're ready.\n\n(Credit: PCMag)\n\nPoint-of-sale terminals that support smartphone-based payment usually indicate the fact with an icon, from a picture of a hand holding a smartphone to a stylized representation of a radio wave. Just place your device on the terminal, authenticate with a thumbprint, and you've paid up.\n\nHow is that better than using the credit card itself? The app generates a one-use authentication code, good for the current transaction only. Even if someone filched that code, it wouldn't do them any good. And paying with a smartphone app eliminates the possibility of data theft by a credit card skimmer.\n\nSome smartphone payment apps let you pay online with a similar one-time code. If yours doesn't, check with your credit card provider. Typically, you get a temporary number to use in place of your real credit card, and the charges go to your regular account. The temporary card number will not work again after it expires. The next time your credit card company or bank calls you to try and sell you upgrades, ask about one-time use card numbers.\n\nYou can also get the protection of one-use credit card numbers using third-party apps. Abine Blur Premium, for example, can mask credit card numbers, email addresses, and phone numbers. You shop and communicate as always, but the merchant doesn't receive your actual information.\n\n8. Use Different Email Addresses for Different Kinds of Accounts\n\nPeople who are both highly organized and methodical about their security often use different email addresses for different purposes, to keep the online identities associated with them separate. If a phishing email claiming to be from your bank comes to the account you use only for social media, you know it's fake.\n\nConsider maintaining one email address dedicated to signing up for apps that you want to try, but which might have questionable security, or which might spam you with promotional messages. After you've vetted a service or app, sign up using one of your permanent email accounts. If the dedicated account starts to get spam, close it, and create a new one. This is a do-it-yourself version of the masked emails you get from Abine Blur and other disposable email account services.\n\nMany sites equate your email address with your username, but some let you select your own username. Consider using a different username every time\u2014hey, your password manager remembers it! Now anyone trying to get into your account must guess both the username and the password.\n\n9. Clear Your Cache\n\nNever underestimate how much your browser's cache knows about you. Saved cookies, saved searches, and Web history could point to home address, family information, and other personal data.\n\n(Credit: PCMag)\n\nTo better protect that information that may be lurking in your Web history, be sure to delete browser cookies and clear your browser history on a regular basis. It's easy. In Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Internet Explorer, or Opera, simply press Ctrl+Shift+Del to bring up a dialog that lets you choose which elements of browser data you want to clear. If you use a different browser, try that key combo regardless; it might work. Otherwise, search the menu.\n\nDeleting cookies may cause trouble for some websites\u2014you may lose any personalization you've applied. Most browsers let you list favorite websites whose cookies shouldn't be tossed.\n\nFor a complete guide to getting started, you can read our feature on how to clear your cache in any browser.\n\n10. Turn Off the 'Save Password' Feature in Browsers\n\nSpeaking of what your browser may know about you, most browsers include a built-in password management solution. We at PCMag don't recommend them, however. We feel it's best to leave password protection to the experts who make password managers.\n\nThink about this. When you install a third-party password manager, it typically offers to import your password from the browser's storage. If the password manager can do that, you can be sure some malicious software can do the same. In addition, keeping your passwords in a single, central password manager lets you use them across all browsers and devices.\n\n11. Don't Fall Prey to Click Bait or Phishing Scams\n\nPart of securing your online life is being smart about what you click. Clickbait doesn't just refer to cat compilation videos and catchy headlines. It can also comprise links in email, messaging apps, and Facebook. Phishing links masquerade as secure websites, hoping to trick you into giving them your credentials. Drive-by download pages can cause malware to automatically download and infect your device.\n\n(Credit: PCMag)\n\nDon't click links in emails or text messages, unless they come from a source you trust. Even then, be cautious; your trusted source might have been compromised, or the message might be fake. The same goes for links on social media sites, even in posts that seem to be from your friends. If a post seems unlike the style of your social media buddy, it could be a hack.\n\nFor more, read our story on how to avoid phishing scams.\n\n12. Protect Your Social Media Privacy\n\nThere\u2019s a common saying: if you\u2019re not paying for a service, you\u2019re not a customer; you\u2019re the product. Social media sites make it easy for you to share your thoughts and pictures with friends, but it\u2019s easy to wind up sharing too much.\n\nYou can download your Facebook data to see just what the social media giant knows about you. It may be quite an eye-opener, especially if you're the kind of person who routinely clicks on quizzes that require access to your social media account. Really, you don't need to know which Disney princess or dog breed you are.\n\nBeware, too, of hackers posing as your social media friends. A common scam starts with a private message and ends with hackers taking over your account and using it to continue the scam. If you get an odd or unexpected private message from a friend, ask about it using email or some other type of communication. Your friend may have been scammed.\n\nYou can drastically reduce the amount of data going to Facebook by disabling the sharing platform entirely. Once you do, your friends can no longer leak your personal data. You can't lose data to apps, because you can't use apps. And you can't use your Facebook credentials to log into other websites (which was always a bad idea).\n\nOf course, other social media sites need attention too. Google probably knows more about you than Facebook, so take steps to manage your Google privacy, too. Make sure you've configured each social media site so that your posts aren't public (well, all except Twitter and other broadcast media services). Think twice before revealing too much in a post, since your friends might share it with others. With care, you can retain your privacy without losing the entertainment and connections of social media.", "label": "human"}

Xinhua/ via Getty Images\n\nThe Admiral Gorshkov is setting sail armed with Zircon, also spelled Tsirkon, hypersonic missiles \u2014 a relatively new weapon in Moscow's arsenal. Putin first revealed the development of the missile during a February 2019 address to the nation, during which he announced work on various weapons while also threatening to target the US if it moved ballistic missiles to Europe.\n\nSpeaking Wednesday, Putin said the Zircon missile has \"no analogues in any country in the world.\"\n\nThe Russian military, using the Admiral Gorshkov as a testing platform, test-fired a Zircon hypersonic missile for the first time in October 2020. The Russian defense ministry said it flew at speeds of Mach 8 before hitting a target nearly 300 miles away. Several tests have occurred since then, most recently last May.\n\nThe Admiral Gorshkov is also outfitted with various other weapons, such as air defenses and torpedoes, TASS cited the ship's captain Igor Krokhmal as saying, though the Zircon hypersonic missiles are perhaps the most noteworthy.\n\n\"We will continue to develop the combat potential of the Armed Forces, make advanced models of weapons and equipment that will guard Russia's security in the coming decades. This is a promising weapon,\" Putin said at the Wednesday ceremony, according to Russian state media.\n\nHypersonic missiles are highly maneuverable and fast, and they can fly along unpredictable flight paths, thus creating headaches for traditional air defenses. Standard ballistic missiles, by contrast, travel on set parabolic trajectories.\n\nHypersonic weapon development by Russia \u2014 and also China \u2014 is a concern for the US military, which is working on its own systems.\n\nIn December, a US B-52 bomber successfully launched a fully-operational hypersonic missile prototype in a milestone weapon test for the Air Force that could pave the way to production and fielding.

{"text": "Ovidio Guzman, son of kingpin Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, is briefly captured by Mexican military police in a residential compound near the centre of Culiacan in the state of Sinaloa, Mexico October 17, 2019 in this still image taken from a helmet camera footage obtained October 30, 2019. Mexican Government Tv | Via Reuters\n\nMexican security forces captured Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n, an alleged drug trafficker wanted by the United States and one of the sons of former Sinaloa cartel boss Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n, in a pre-dawn operation Thursday that set off gunfights and roadblocks across the western state's capital. Defense Secretary Luis Cresencio Sandoval said Army and National Guard personnel had captured a son of \"El Chapo.\" Sandoval identified him only as Ovidio, in keeping with government policy. Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n, nicknamed \"the Mouse,\" had not been one of El Chapo's better-known sons until an aborted operation to capture him three years ago. That attempt similarly set off violence in Culiacan that ultimately led President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador to order the military to let him go. Thursday's high-profile capture comes just days before L\u00f3pez Obrador will host U.S. President Joe Biden for bilateral talks followed by their North American Leaders' Summit with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Drug trafficking, along with immigration, is expected to be a top talking point. \"This is a significant blow to the Sinaloa cartel and major victory for the rule of law. It will not, however, impede the flow of drugs into the U.S. Hopefully, Mexico will extradite him to the U.S.,\" Mike Vigil, the DEA's former Chief of International Operations, said Thursday.\n\nA burning truck is seen across a street during an operation to arrest the son of Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, Ovidio Guzman, in Culiacan, Sinaloa state, Mexico, on January 5, 2023. Marcos Vizcarra | AFP | Getty Images\n\nVigil said that Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n was involved in all of the cartel's activities, especially the production of fentanyl. A 2018 federal indictment in Washington, D.C., accused the younger Guzm\u00e1n of conspiring to distribute cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana in the United States. The CDC said last July that more than 107,000 Americans had died from a drug overdose during the year ending January 2022, most of them involving opioids including illegally made fentanyl. L\u00f3pez Obrador's security approach reversed years of what came to be known as the kingpin strategy of taking down cartel leaders, which led to the fragmentation of large cartels and bloody battles for dominance. L\u00f3pez Obrador put all his faith in the military, disbanding the corrupt Federal Police and creating the National Guard under military command. The capture was the result of six months of reconnaissance and surveillance in the cartel's territory, and then quick action on Thursday, Sandoval said. National Guard troops spotted SUVs, some with homemade armor, and immediately coordinated with the army as they established a perimeter around the suspicious vehicles and forced the occupants out to be searched. The security forces then came under fire, but were able to gain control of the situation and identify Guzm\u00e1n among those present and in possession of firearms, Sandoval said.\n\nBurning vehicles are seen crossed in the street during an operation to arrest the son of Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, Ovidio Guzman, in Culiacan, Sinaloa state, Mexico, on January 5, 2023. Marcos Vizcarra | Afp | Getty Images\n\nCartel members set up 19 roadblocks including at Culiacan's airport and outside the local army base, as well as all points of access to the city of Culiacan, Sandoval said, but the Air Force was able to fly Guzm\u00e1n to Mexico City despite their efforts, and he was taken to offices of the Attorney General's organized crime special prosecutor. Sandoval said Guzm\u00e1n was a leader of a Sinaloa faction he called \"los menores\" or \"the juniors,\" who are also known as \"los Chapitos,\" for the sons of El Chapo. Other \"little Chapos\" include two of his brothers \u2014 Iv\u00e1n Archivaldo Guzm\u00e1n and Jes\u00fas Alfredo Guzm\u00e1n \u2014 who are believed to have been running cartel operations together with Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada. The Chapitos have been taking greater control in the cartel because Zambada was in poor health and isolated in the mountains, Vigil said. \"The Chapitos know that if el Mayo dies, (the cartel) is going to break apart if they don't have control.\" \"It's going to be very important that the U.S. requests Ovidio's extradition quickly and that Mexico does it,\" Vigil said.\n\nwatch now\n\nForeign Affairs Secretary Marcelo Ebrard confirmed that Mexico received a request in 2019 from the United States for Guzm\u00e1n's arrest for purposes of extradition. He said that request would have to be updated and processed, but he added that Guzm\u00e1n must first face an open case in Mexico. U.S. Homeland Security Investigations had posted a $5 million reward for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Guzm\u00e1n early last year. Alleged cartel members responded to Thursday's operation by carjacking Culiacan residents and setting vehicles ablaze in the cartel stronghold. Local and state authorities warned everyone to stay inside. Intermittent gunfire continued into the afternoon Thursday in Culiacan as Mexican security forces continued to clash with cartel gunmen and few people ventured out. Airline Aeromexico said in a statement that one of its jets was struck by a bullet Thursday morning as it prepared for takeoff. Passenger video posted online showed people cowering on the floor of the plane. The company said passengers and crew were safe. Later, Mexico's Civil Aviation Agency said in a statement that an air force plane in Culiacan had also been hit with gunfire. In addition to the Culiacan airport, the agency said airports in Los Mochis and Mazatlan were also ordered closed and all flights cancelled for security reasons.\n\nwatch now\n\nDavid T\u00e9llez was aboard that flight with his wife and children, preparing to return to Mexico City after visiting his in-laws. Their plane had been waiting for its chance to take off as two large military planes carrying personnel landed as well as three or four military helicopters. Marines and soldiers deployed along the perimeter of the runway. When the commercial flight was finally preparing to accelerate, T\u00e9llez heard gunshots in the distance. Within 15 seconds the sounds were suddenly more intense. \"We heard gunshots and threw ourselves to the floor,\" he said. He did not know the plane had been hit until a flight attendant told them. The plane quickly returned to the terminal and they were hustled into a room. Late Thursday afternoon they were still in the airport, unsure of when they would be able to return to Mexico City.

{"text": "A culinary institution like Waffle House has been serving late-night cravings for decades, but did you know that there's more to the iconic diner than meets the eye? A former employee has spilled the beans on the \"secret\" marking system used by servers to identify orders.\n\nTyler Jones, a former Waffle House employee in Georgia, revealed that the system involves using symbols on plates to quickly identify which order belongs to which customer. The symbols, ranging from small circles to larger X's, serve as a code for the servers to write down the order on a slip of paper and place it on the ticket board.\n\nBut what do these symbols actually mean? According to Jones, each Waffle House may have its own unique coding system, but there's a general consensus on what they mean. For instance, a small circle often indicates a customer in a hurry, while a star is used to note a customer who wants their order ASAP. An X typically signifies a customer with special dietary needs.\n\nThis secret marking system serves two purposes: it helps employees quickly identify orders and gives them a heads-up on tricky customers. Jones revealed that servers might use a symbol to indicate a difficult customer's attitude, warning their coworkers to be prepared.\n\nWhile using a secret code to mark orders is common practice among restaurants, it's fascinating to get an inside look at how Waffle House handles its orders. The system is simple yet effective, allowing employees to communicate without customers being any the wiser.\n\nSo, the next time you're in line at Waffle House, take a closer look at what the servers are writing on those plates.

{"text": "Establecer un equilibrio saludable en las celebraciones de fin de a\u00f1o\n\nMientras disfrutamos de las fiestas de fin de a\u00f1o, muchos de nosotros nos embriagamos y nos preguntamos c\u00f3mo reducir el consumo de alcohol y prepararnos para los buenos prop\u00f3sitos de A\u00f1o Nuevo.\n\nDespu\u00e9s de las celebraciones, la idea de reducir o eliminar el consumo de alcohol puede parecer intimidante. Sin embargo, los cient\u00edficos han desarrollado un programa de cinco claves que pueden ayudarnos a encontrar el camino correcto.\n\nSeg\u00fan la National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), una bebida est\u00e1ndar equivale a 12 onzas de cerveza, 5 onzas de vino o 1.5 onzas de bebida destilada.\n\nEl consumo excesivo de alcohol se ha asociado con problemas de salud, como enfermedades card\u00edacas, c\u00e1ncer y cirrosis.\n\nA continuaci\u00f3n, se presentan cinco claves para reducir el consumo de alcohol:\n\n1. Establecer metas personales: El primer paso es reconocer la necesidad de reducir el consumo y comprometerse a hacerlo. Una vez que est\u00e9 motivado, se necesita una forma de llevar la cuenta, como una app de seguimiento de alcohol o una lista escrita. Esto le ayudar\u00e1 a tomar conciencia de su consumo de alcohol y cumplir con su objetivo de reducci\u00f3n.\n\n2. Crear un plan de acci\u00f3n: La pr\u00f3xima clave para reducir el consumo de alcohol es crear un plan s\u00f3lido. Esto incluye escribir una lista de todos los motivos por los que quiere reducir el consumo de alcohol. Tambi\u00e9n puede ayudar a establecer l\u00edmites y objetivos diarios de consumo de alcohol.\n\n3. Evitar situaciones de tentaci\u00f3n: Las tentaciones siempre estar\u00e1n presentes, as\u00ed que es importante evitar situaciones que puedan llevar a un consumo excesivo de alcohol. Esto puede incluir evitar lugares donde se sirva alcohol o mantener la cantidad de alcohol en su casa al m\u00ednimo.\n\n4. Reemplazar el alcohol con opciones saludables: Reemplazar el alcohol con opciones m\u00e1s saludables, como agua, jugos, t\u00e9 o caf\u00e9, puede ayudar a disminuir el consumo de alcohol. Estos refrescos tambi\u00e9n tienen la ventaja de ser m\u00e1s baratos y contener menos calor\u00edas que las bebidas alcoh\u00f3licas.\n\n5. Buscar apoyo y recursos: La \u00faltima clave para reducir el consumo de alcohol es buscar apoyo y recursos. Un grupo de apoyo o un terapeuta pueden ser excelentes recursos para ayudarle a controlar su consumo. Adem\u00e1s, los amigos y la familia que comprenden sus metas pueden ser una gran ayuda cuando intenta mantenerse alejado del alcohol.\n\nEs importante recordar que reducir el consumo de alcohol no siempre es f\u00e1cil y puede llevar su tiempo. Si no est\u00e1 seguro de qu\u00e9 camino tomar, consulte con un profesional m\u00e9dico o un terapeuta para recibir ayuda.\n\nLa ciencia ha demostrado que reducir el consumo de alcohol ayuda a prevenir los problemas de salud relacionados con el alcohol y mejorar la calidad de vida.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is taking proactive measures to enhance investor understanding of environmental and climate-related risks associated with their investments. The US financial regulator has issued a public request for input to gauge opinions on measuring and reporting climate-related data and incorporating climate risks into corporate governance structures. This move follows similar steps taken by other countries, such as the UK, to help investors manage climate risks.\n\nThe SEC's request for comment, issued on March 5, seeks public opinion on the types of data and metrics companies should provide to investors to accurately reflect their climate impact. This request is part of the Commission's broader \"Environmental & Climate Risk Disclosure Initiative,\" which was announced in October 2019 to explore how public companies address climate change-related risks and opportunities.\n\nThe feedback received from this comment period will help the SEC better understand the impact of corporate climate disclosure and the specific disclosures companies should make. The Commission is expected to use this feedback to inform rules that require public companies to provide enhanced disclosure about their environmental and climate-related risks, as well as what their respective companies are doing to mitigate those risks.\n\nThe initiative is already yielding tangible results, with many companies beginning to incorporate climate-related risks into their corporate governance structures. This includes incorporating climate-related risk into strategic planning and performance metrics, identifying and addressing physical and transition risks, and introducing board-level oversight of climate-related risk management activities.\n\nThe initiative has also prompted investors to ask companies to disclose their climate risks to protect their investments. As investors become more aware of the potential impacts of climate change on their investments, they are demanding better disclosure from companies on their plans to manage climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nThe initiative comes as countries worldwide are taking steps to reduce their emissions and transition to a low-carbon economy. Many countries have adopted targets, such as net-zero emissions by 2050, that have ripple effects throughout the global economy. To reach these targets, investors and companies must understand the physical and transition risks associated with climate change and the opportunities associated with meeting global targets.\n\nThe SEC's initiative has the potential to be transformative, not only for investors and companies but also for the global economy. Improved corporate climate-related disclosure could help investors better understand and value the effects of climate change on their investments, while providing companies with the insights they need to manage the associated risks and opportunities. Additionally, more transparency could encourage financial institutions to shift capital to projects and businesses that contribute to the global fight against climate change.\n\nThe SEC is expected to issue a final ruling on the initiative in the coming months, so stay tuned to find out how the agency's regulations will shape corporate climate-related disclosure for years to come. In the meantime, investors should keep a close eye on how companies are adapting their corporate governance structures to address climate risk and opportunity.\n\nThough the regulations are yet to be finalized, this move by the SEC is a positive step in the direction of improved transparency and accountability. By requiring US companies to better communicate their climate-related risks and opportunities, investors and companies alike can better understand and manage their climate-related risks. With improved corporate disclosure, investors will have the information they need to make more informed decisions, while companies will be better positioned to realize the opportunities associated with transitioning to a low-carbon economy.\n\nThough the regulations are yet to be finalized, the SEC's proposed rules are an important step in the direction of improving climate-related transparency and accountability. With the help of the proposed regulations, investors and companies can better understand and manage their climate-related risks, while transitioning to a low-carbon economy. In the end, investors, companies, and the global economy can all benefit from improved corporate disclosure.", "label": "machine"}

This diverse group of young adults, including Isan Elba, Kyra Kennedy, Krista Gwyneth Paltrow, and others, discussed the intricate balance between the benefits and drawbacks of having influential parents. These benefits include access to top-notch education, exclusive networking opportunities, and a certain level of exposure, but also come with the potential for bullying, pressure to conform, and feelings of disconnection from one's own identity.\n\nThe publication's story sparked a lively debate, with some readers praising the effort to humanize the experiences of celebrity children and others dismissing it as self-indulgent.

{"text": "The price-to-earnings multiples say recession. But the multiples said similar things in 2022. So how long can the multiples stay this low? We have all read dozens of articles about what 2023 will bring us. I think most are sincere. Their only drawback, as usual, is that they don't touch on stocks themselves. They might say that the S & P 500 , currently trading at 18-times earnings, could trade down to 16-times earnings even if earnings stay relatively steady. Or, they could say that if the terminal rate is 5% on the Federal's Reserve's fed funds rate , we might get to 14-times earnings. But these analyses don't tell you how they got to that S & P target. So, I want to attack the S & P target thesis by looking at a few stocks that signal the uselessness of the projections. Let's start with two stocks: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Nucor (NUE). Pharmaceuticals giant J & J, one of my favorites in the Club portfolio, trades at 18-times forward earnings for 2023. And I think that reflects a recession is coming, given that its earnings should not be hurt by a slowdown. If we get a recession, then the stock will trade higher, not lower, as a recession would likely signal the end of the Fed's interest rate hikes. Now let's take Nucor, the world's finest steel maker. It is projected to earn $28 a share this year and then drop to $12 a share next year, as a likely recession takes hold. I have a hard time with the 4-times earnings it currently trades at, but it's obvious that the stock market is setting up for a serious recession that would cause Nucor to have its earnings more than halved. But where do those earnings come from? The largest earnings sector will be infrastructure which, rather than take a hit, should go higher given fresh federal government spending kicks in next year. That infrastructure spending includes everything from bridges and tunnels to buildings, which Nucor dominates. Then Nucor also has heavy oil-and-gas exposure through its pipeline and heavy-equipment businesses. At the same time, industrial Caterpillar (CAT) sells at 18-times earnings because of demand. That mocks Nucor's 4-times. With those end-markets and with CAT's dramatically higher multiple, something has to give. Something is wrong. I think it's Nucor's earnings estimates for 2023 \u2014 they are too low. My point being is that you have the most cyclical stocks trading as if they are falling apart, but the heavier equipment traditional cyclicals trading not just higher, but much higher. My conclusion is that JNJ is \"right\" in what it sells at, Caterpillar and the like are most likely slightly wrong\u2014 too high, but still in the mix \u2014and Nucor and the like are just dead wrong. So why aren't we buying Nucor? Because I think it can go lower. Meanwhile, the automobile sector looms large, and auto is considered to be something that will plunge next year as demand abates. I think the market is making a serious misjudgment on that thesis. People have held off buying because cars and trucks are unnaturally too high, due to supply constraints and higher interest rates. Ultimately, I think autos will stay strong in a recession. Therefore, the best compromise is Ford (F), which should, barring still one more supply shock from China, make the most sense. We added to our position in Ford on Thursday. Still, all things considered let me make one more point: If a Caterpillar or a Deere (DE) were to come down to lower levels, it would make a great deal of sense to buy. One more quandary: Aerospace. A recession should dry up airplane demand, but replacement is critical. Club holding Honeywell (HON), which makes cockpits and airplane engines, sells at 24-times earnings, while Raytheon Technologies (RTX) clocks in at 21-times earnings. The latter is most likely undervalued as a result of Russia's war in Ukraine. Are these justifiable? They are the highest multiples in the entire market, including Club holdings Apple (APPL) and Alphabet (GOOGL). It could all meet in the middle. I see some shrinking of the large caps. Semiconductors are a moving, albeit diminishing target, with the exception of outlier Nvdia (NVDA) at 44-times earnings, which is now a small Club position because of its vulnerability. All but the fastest-growing companies could trade at around 16-17-times earnings. That's going to be our broad assumption for next year \u2014 a mix of soft goods with higher multiples and cyclicals with lower ones. The debatable stocks are in tech, which are poised to disappoint even if a so-called clearing event should ultimately come about.

{"text": "The upcoming vote for Speaker of the House on January 3, 2023, will be a significant event, marking the first time in over 40 years that the House will not have a Speaker backed by a single party.\n\nThe Speaker, currently held by Nancy Pelosi, will face a challenge from a Republican opponent, marking a change from the usual party-line voting.\n\nThe House of Representatives is the lower chamber of Congress, comprising 435 members from the 50 states, Washington D.C., and five U.S. territories. Each state has at least one Representative, with the number of members determined by its population.\n\nThe Speaker is elected by the full House membership at the beginning of each Congress and is responsible for presiding over House proceedings. This includes deciding which bills come up for debate, managing parliamentary procedures, and appointing committee members.\n\nTraditionally, the Speaker is elected with a single party holding an absolute majority, but with the current House divided almost evenly between Democrats and Republicans, it is unlikely that either party will secure a majority.\n\nAs a result, the vote is expected to be much closer than usual, with both parties needing to form coalitions to secure the position. This unprecedented event could have far-reaching implications for the legislative agenda and balance of power in Congress.\n\nThe outcome could lead to a shift in the balance of power, giving the winning party greater sway in the passage of bills. Alternatively, a Republican majority could result in legislation more in line with the party's views being more likely to pass.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, the vote will be historic, marking the first time in over 40 years that the House will not have a Speaker backed by a single party. The results could set the tone for the legislative agenda in the coming months, making the vote a significant event in the lead-up to the next election.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "RENO, Nev. (AP) \u2014 The serious injuries actor Jeremy Renner suffered while using a snow tractor to free a snowbound motorist on a private mountain road near Lake Tahoe appear to be the result of a \u201ctragic accident,\u201d the sheriff in Reno said Tuesday.\n\nThe 51-year-old \"Avengers\" star was seriously hurt when he was run over by his own snowcat after using it to free a vehicle driven by a family member that became stuck in 3 feet (0.9 meters) of fresh mountain snow on New Year's Day, Washoe County Sheriff Darin Balaam said.\n\nAn investigation is continuing but there were no signs of foul play or any indication Renner was impaired at the time of the Sunday morning incident, Balaam told reporters.\n\n\u201cAt this point in the investigation ... we believe this is a tragic accident,\u201d the sheriff said. \u201cHe was being a great neighbor and he was plowing those roads for his neighbors.\"\n\nThe accident left Renner in critical but stable condition with chest and orthopedic injuries, according to a publicist and sheriff's officials who said Renner was flown by medical helicopter about 25 miles (40 kilometers) to a Reno hospital.\n\nAbout the same time reporters were gathering with Balaam on Tuesday, Renner posted an Instagram photo of himself in a hospital bed and a message, missing an apostrophe.\n\n\u201cThank you all for your kind words,\" it said. \"Im too messed up now to type. But I send love to you all.\u201d\n\nBalaam said Renner had used his Pistenbully snow groomer, a 7-ton vehicle he owns, to tow another personal vehicle that had become snowbound on a private road he shares with neighbors.\n\n\u201cAfter successfully towing his personal vehicle from its stuck location, Mr. Renner got out of his (snowcat) to speak to his family member,\" Balaam said. \u201cThe Pistenbully started to roll.

{"text": "The Indian automotive industry experienced a surprising uptick in December, with utility vehicle sales increasing by 3.7% year-over-year, bucking the trend of sluggishness. In contrast, passenger car sales continued to struggle, dropping 8% to 207,530 units. The utility vehicle segment has been the sole bright spot in the industry, growing around 11% this fiscal year, and includes SUVs, multi-purpose vehicles, and vans.\n\nAccording to data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), domestic automakers are focusing on utility vehicles, despite a lack of demand for passenger cars. Leading automakers such as Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra & Mahindra, and Tata Motors have benefited from this trend. SIAM attributed the weak passenger car sales to a decline in consumer sentiment, tight credit conditions, and a lack of new launches.\n\nSIAM's director general, Vishnu Mathur, noted that the demand for utility vehicles is more resilient than passenger cars, driven by consumer preferences for convenience, safety, and a stronger rural demand. Mathur also mentioned that the industry has been struggling to sustain sales despite cost-cutting measures.\n\nThe industry's slump has had a ripple effect on other sectors, as it accounts for about half of the country's total output of industrial parts and components. However, Mathur expressed optimism that the situation will improve with the launch of new models and the government's economic stimulus package. The festive season could also act as a catalyst for growth.\n\nAnalysts believe that an improvement in consumer sentiment will be crucial in reviving the auto sector. For now, the industry will have to rely on the utility vehicle segment to stay afloat, while awaiting a turnaround.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The Federal Reserve's reverse repo facility has reached a new milestone of $2.554 trillion, nearly doubling its level from earlier this year, as the US economy rapidly recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe facility, a tool used by the central bank to manage money and interest rates in the banking system, has seen a significant increase from $1.32 trillion in May, reaching the new peak on Thursday.\n\nThe figures come as the US economy shows signs of recovering faster than initially anticipated from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. US jobless claims dropped last week to the lowest level since the coronavirus crisis first began in March, while the manufacturing sector is experiencing strong expansion.\n\nThe rising activity means demand for funds is increasing, and the Fed is providing more money to banks and other institutions to meet that need. Reverse repos provide the central bank with additional reserves to manage its interest rate target, which it has held near zero since March 2020.\n\nThe amount of money held in the facility is also rising in line with the Fed's commitment to keeping benchmark interest rates low, allowing banks and financial institutions to borrow funds from the central bank overnight at a low rate of interest.\n\nThe increase in the facility has been steady since mid-August, when it stood at around $1.3 trillion. This is in contrast to earlier in the year when the Fed had reduced the facility's usage to just $54 billion to avoid flooding the financial system with too much liquidity.\n\nThe Fed has pledged to keep interest rates close to zero until the economy has made further progress toward its goals of maximum employment and inflation. According to the latest data, the unemployment rate remains high at 6.9%, while inflation has remained below the Fed's two percent target.\n\nThe Fed's ongoing purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities, which have added over $3 trillion to its balance sheet since the beginning of 2020, have kept long-term interest rates low, giving a boost to economic activity.\n\nThe Fed is likely to keep the reverse repo facility at an elevated level through the end of 2021 as it continues to manage liquidity and interest rates. The facility also serves as a signal to financial markets of the central bank's commitment to keeping interest rates low and providing sufficient liquidity to the banking system.\n\nThe record high usage of the facility is expected to boost borrowing costs in the banking sector, since the funds will have to be paid back at a higher rate than that prevailing when the money was initially borrowed.\n\nThe surge in the Fed's reverse repo facility is another sign of the ongoing recovery in the US economy, though the full impact of the pandemic is still to be seen. The job market remains weak, with millions of Americans still unemployed, and the pace of growth in the manufacturing sector is beginning to slow.\n\nThe Fed's monetary policy remains in flux, and the future of the economy is still uncertain. The central bank's commitment to keeping interest rates low and providing liquidity is expected to continue to underpin the recovery in the coming months, even as the health crisis persists.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The perpetual peculiarity of pecuniary predicaments in the United States persists, with Americans burdened by an astonishing $1.6 trillion in educational debt. Although the Trump Administration announced a plan to provide relief to certain borrowers, the uncertainty surrounding this initiative remains.\n\nOn a recent Monday, the U.S. Department of Justice submitted a written argument to the Supreme Court, contesting a lower court's decision to implement student loan forgiveness. The Supreme Court is expected to hear the case, but the timing of its verdict is unclear.\n\nThe legal dispute centers around a set of regulations introduced by the Obama Administration in 2015, designed to facilitate the forgiveness of student loans in cases where educational institutions close or misrepresent their programs. These regulations, known as the \"Borrower Defense Rule,\" established a pathway for borrowers to have their loans discharged.\n\nThe Trump Administration had sought to delay and weaken the Borrower Defense Rule, but was blocked by the lower court. The Administration subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn their written argument, the U.S. Department of Justice contended that the lower court overstepped its authority by compelling the Trump Administration to implement the Borrower Defense Rule. The Department also argued that the rule was a \"remarkably sloppy piece of policymaking\" lacking constitutional or statutory authority.\n\nThe filing of this brief marks the latest development in a prolonged legal battle over student loan forgiveness. The case has been ongoing since the Obama Administration introduced the Borrower Defense Rule in 2015.\n\nThe legal struggle has been protracted, with both the Trump Administration and Democratic attorneys general filing lawsuits and appeals in an effort to either implement or halt the Borrower Defense Rule.\n\nThe fate of student loan forgiveness remains uncertain, but the filing of the brief by the Trump Administration suggests that the Supreme Court will ultimately decide the matter. Until then, millions of student loan borrowers remain in a state of limbo, awaiting a resolution that will determine whether their student loan debt can be forgiven.\n\nThe case is particularly significant for borrowers struggling to make payments on their student loans. Borrowers who have taken out loans since the rule was enacted in 2015 may not be eligible for loan forgiveness.\n\nMany advocates for borrowers argue that the rule should remain in effect to assist borrowers. Student loan debt is a pressing financial issue in the United States, and some suggest that loan forgiveness could alleviate the burden on borrowers.\n\nThe prolonged legal battle over student loan forgiveness has left many borrowers in the dark. With the Trump Administration filing its brief to the Supreme Court, those borrowers remain in limbo until the justices render a decision. It may be some time before a resolution is reached, leaving many borrowers uncertain about the fate of their loans.", "label": "machine"}

And I don\u2019t say that to be disparaging to anyone, because it was a really hard week of the wedding, and she was upset about something, but she owned it, and she apologized, and she brought me flowers and a note apologizing and she did what I would do if I knew that I hurt someone. To just take accountability for it.\n\n\u201cWhat was shocking was, what was that, six, seven months after our wedding, the reverse of that would be out in the world [the story suggesting Meghan made Kate cry]. I would\u2019ve never wanted that to come out about her ever even though it had happened. I protected that from ever being out in the world. A few days before the wedding, she was upset about something pertaining\u2014yes, the issue was correct about flower girl dresses, and it made me cry and it really hurt my feelings, and I thought in the context of everything else that was going on in those days leading to the wedding that it didn\u2019t make sense to not be just doing what everyone else was doing, which was try to be supportive, knowing what was going on with my dad and whatnot.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a confrontation, and I actually think it\u2019s...I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to her to get into the details of that because she apologized and I\u2019ve forgiven her,\u201d Meghan said. \u201cWhat was hard to get over was being blamed for something that not only I didn\u2019t do but that happened to me and the people that were a part of my wedding going to my comms team, saying, I know this didn\u2019t happen. I don't have to tell them what actually happened, but I can at least go on the record saying, \u2018She didn't make her cry.\u2019 Everyone in the institution knew it wasn't true. I'm not sharing that piece about Kate in any way to be disparaging to her. I think it's really important for people to understand the truth, but also I think a lot of it that was fed into by the media. Look, I would hope that she would've wanted that corrected. And maybe in the same way that the Palace wouldn't let anybody else negate it, they wouldn't let her, because she's a good person, and I think so much of what I have seen play out was this idea of polarity where if you love me you don't have to hate her, and if you love her, you don\u2019t need to hate me.\u201d\n\nHarry would go on to allege in his and Meghan's Netflix docuseries Harry & Meghan that his brother, Prince William, and Kate Middleton's press office would later start planting negative stories about him and Meghan to tabloids.\n\n\u201cYou know, there\u2019s leaking, but there\u2019s also planting of stories,\u201d Harry explained. \u201cSo if the comms teams want to be able to remove a negative story about their principle, they will trade and give you something about someone else\u2019s principle.

{"text": "The tranquil town of Sutherland Springs, Texas, was shaken to its core in 2017 when a gunman unleashed a devastating attack on a small Baptist church, claiming the lives of 26 innocent individuals. This heinous act of violence, one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history, sent shockwaves throughout the nation, prompting widespread calls for stricter gun control measures.\n\nHowever, four years have passed, and the survivors' families are now grappling with a new source of frustration: the Trump administration's decision to challenge a court ruling that could have strengthened the nation's gun laws. The U.S. Department of Justice, under the Trump administration, is appealing an August 2019 court ruling that deemed a Texas law prohibiting the sale of firearms to individuals convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence unconstitutional.\n\nThe original lawsuit was brought by an individual with a history of domestic abuse, and the ruling effectively stripped states of their authority to implement stricter gun regulations. The Justice Department is now seeking to overturn the decision, arguing that it will enhance national safety by allowing states to impose restrictions on gun access.\n\nThe Justice Department's stance has been met with outrage in Sutherland Springs, where the shooting sparked a powerful movement to reform America's gun laws. \"It's an affront to the individuals who lost their lives that day and an affront to everyone affected by gun violence in this country,\" said Donnie Langford, a local survivor who is now a vocal advocate for gun control.\n\n\"We were hoping for more from our government, not less,\" Langford said. \"But this administration has done nothing but stand in the way of progress.\"\n\nMembers of the Sutherland Springs community have long pushed for lawmakers to strengthen the nation's gun laws. In the wake of the shooting, local leaders met with state legislators and lobbied Washington for changes, including tighter regulations on firearms sales, expanded background checks, and restrictions on military-style weapons.\n\nDespite their efforts, tangible changes have been scarce. After a wave of state legislative action following the mass shooting, the Trump administration made its move to block further progress. \"We have fought long and hard to ensure our elected officials are listening to us,\" said Becky Covell, a Sutherland Springs resident and member of the group TX Moms Demand Action, which was formed in response to the shooting.\n\n\"But this latest move shows us that we still have a long way to go,\" she added.\n\nThe Justice Department's appeal, filed in November, is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to hinder state efforts to pass gun control laws. The Justice Department is also appealing a ruling in a separate case brought by gun control advocates in New York City that upheld a requirement for gun owners to store their firearms in lock boxes or trigger locks.\n\nThe appeals are only the latest hurdles faced by gun-control advocates in their uphill battle to enact stricter gun regulations. The National Rifle Association, the nation's most powerful gun rights group, has come out against the Trump administration's appeals, arguing that they will infringe upon gun owners' rights.\n\nDespite the setbacks, advocates in Sutherland Springs are vowing to continue their fight for gun safety. \"This is the same type of decision-making that has left our country facing the gun violence crisis it does today,\" Covell said. \"But we're not going to let it stop us \u2014 we're going to keep pushing for gun safety in this country, no matter what.\"", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Federal Reserve officials are committed to fighting inflation and expect higher interest rates to remain in place until more progress is made, according to minutes released Wednesday from the central bank's December meeting.\n\nAt a meeting where policymakers raised their key interest rate another half a percentage point, they expressed the importance of keeping restrictive policy in place while inflation holds unacceptably high.\n\n\"Participants generally observed that a restrictive policy stance would need to be maintained until the incoming data provided confidence that inflation was on a sustained downward path to 2 percent, which was likely to take some time,\" the meeting summary stated. \"In view of the persistent and unacceptably high level of inflation, several participants commented that historical experience cautioned against prematurely loosening monetary policy.\"\n\nThe increase ended a streak of four consecutive three-quarter point rate hikes, while taking the target range for the benchmark fed funds rate to 4.25%-4.5%, its highest level in 15 years.\n\nOfficials also said they would focus on data as they move forward and see \"the need to retain flexibility and optionality\" regarding policy.\n\nOfficials further cautioned that the public shouldn't read too much into the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee's move to step down the pace of increases.\n\n\"A number of participants emphasized that it would be important to clearly communicate that a slowing in the pace of rate increases was not an indication of any weakening of the Committee's resolve to achieve its price-stability goal or a judgment that inflation was already on a persistent downward path,\" the minutes said.\n\nFollowing the meeting, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that while there has been some progress made in the battle against inflation, he saw only halting signs and expects rates to hold at higher levels even after the increases cease.\n\nThe minutes reflected those sentiments, noting that no FOMC members expect rate cuts in 2023, despite market pricing.\n\nMarkets currently are pricing in the likelihood of rate increases totaling 0.5-0.75 percentage point before pausing to evaluate the impact the hikes are having on the economy. Traders expect the central bank to approve a quarter-point increase at the next meeting, which concludes Feb. 1, according to CME Group data.\n\nCurrent pricing also indicates the possibility of a small reduction in rates by the end of the year, with the funds rate landing around a range of 4.5%-4.75%. Fed officials, however, have expressed doubt repeatedly about any loosening of policy in 2023.\n\nThe minutes noted that officials are wrestling with two-pronged policy risks: One, that the Fed doesn't keep rates high long enough and allows inflation to fester, similar to the experience in the 1970s; and two, that the Fed keeps restrictive policy in place too long and slows the economy too much, \"potentially placing the largest burdens on the most vulnerable groups of the population.\"\n\nHowever, members said they see the risks more weighted to easing too soon and allowing inflation to run rampant.\n\n\"Participants generally indicated that upside risks to the inflation outlook remained a key factor shaping the outlook for policy,\" the minutes said. \"Participants generally observed that maintaining a restrictive policy stance for a sustained period until inflation is clearly on a path toward 2 percent is appropriate from a risk-management perspective.\"\n\nAlong with the rate hikes, the Fed has been reducing the size of its balance sheet by allowing up to $95 billion in proceeds from maturing securities to roll off each month rather than be reinvested. In a program started in early June, the Fed has seen its balance sheet contract by $364 billion to $8.6 trillion.\n\nWhile some of the recent inflation metrics have shown progress, the labor market, a critical target of the rate increases, has been resilient. Nonfarm payroll growth has exceeded expectations for most of the past year, and data earlier Wednesday showed that the number of job openings is still nearly twice the pool of available workers.\n\nThe Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index less food and energy, was at 4.7% annually in November, down from its 5.4% peak in February 2022 but still well above the Fed's 2% target.\n\nEconomists, meanwhile, largely expect the U.S. to enter a recession in the coming months, the result of the Fed's tightening and an economy dealing with inflation still running near 40-year highs. However, fourth-quarter GDP for 2022 is tracking at a solid 3.9% rate, easily the best of a year that started out with consecutive negative readings, according to the Atlanta Fed.\n\nMinneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said Wednesday, in a post for the district's website, that he sees the funds rate rising to 5.4% and possibly higher if inflation doesn't trend down.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "It\u2019s time to put the handcuffs on easy access to weapons of war in Illinois.\n\nWhen the Illinois Senate returns on Sunday and Tuesday, its members should pass legislation to protect Illinoisans by cracking down on powerful firearms that draw terrifying targets on our loved ones, our communities and ourselves. No one needs a weapon of war to hunt deer.\n\nEarly on Friday, the state House of Representatives passed a measure \u2014 the Protect Illinois Communities Act \u2014 that, among other provisions, would ban the sale of assault weapons and ammunition magazines that hold more than 12 rounds.\n\nThe House version also would ban devices called \u201cswitches\u201d that essentially turn firearms into machine guns. Generally, legal guns require the trigger to be pulled for each shot. Switches turn them into fully automatic weapons that keep on firing as long as the trigger is held down. Actual machine guns are so heavily regulated by federal law that legal versions don\u2019t show up on the streets.\n\nEditorials bug Editorials\n\nAs so often happens in Springfield, the House and Senate need to come to a last-second agreement to pass a bill before the legislative session runs out. The new Legislature starts on Jan. 11. Negotiators said on Friday they are working to iron out a final bill.\n\nAs the bill stood on Friday, owners of assault weapons would be allowed to keep them as long as they registered them with the state police within 300 days of the law taking effect, a requirement we support. But the sale, deliver or purchase of those weapons would no longer be legal. Owners of high-capacity magazines that hold more than 12 rounds would have to convert, dispose of or sell them within 90 days.\n\nWhatever version emerges from the negotiations between the House and Senate must be carefully crafted, a tall order at the last minute. For example, defining which weapons are categorized as assault weapons and avoiding loopholes is a challenge. But the most essential thing is to get a bill passed. Lawmakers could debate details forever. Only six days into the new year, there already were 13 mass shootings across the nation, including one in Chicago on New Year\u2019s Day.\n\nIn Washington, a law to crack down on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines seems unlikely to get through Congress, with its Republican House majority, despite President Joe Biden\u2019s support. Yet eight states and the District of Columbia have enacted some kind of ban on assault weapons. Illinois should join them. Gov. J.B. Pritzker has said he is ready to sign a bill.\n\nIllinois\u2019 most vivid recent demonstration of the terror that military style weapons can inflict occurred at Highland Park\u2019s July 4th parade, when seven people were killed and many more were injured. But rapid-fire firearms with high-capacity magazines frequently spread devastation on streets in Chicago and elsewhere in the state as well, leaving numerous victims dead or wounded.\n\nWaiting until the next session to act on gun violence would simply not be acceptable. More people would die unnecessarily as time drags on, and other important issues might divert the Legislature\u2019s attention.\n\nNeed we unnecessarily risk the next Highland Park? The next East Garfield Park, where 14 people, including three children, were hit by gunfire within seconds at a remembrance vigil last October? The next Uvalde, Texas; Sandy Hook, Connecticut; or Buffalo, New York? The next Orlando, Florida; Sutherland Springs, Texas; or El Paso, Texas? The next Las Vegas, Nevada or Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Florida?\n\nStates can\u2019t look to gun manufacturers to help stem the carnage. The manufactures market their high-powered products in a way that can appeal to individuals who have no thought of public safety.\n\nEven if all assault weapons can be taken off the street, other guns still will be used to commit crimes and kill people. But an assault weapons ban is a piece of the solution.\n\nIllinoisans need \u2014 and deserve \u2014 a safer state. Get the job done now.\n\nWant to write a letter or an op-ed for the Sun-Times?

{"text": "In recent times, the notion of a fleeting price surge has resurfaced, particularly among developed nations, as the global economy continues to navigate the aftermath of the pandemic. The sudden and unexpected spike in consumer prices in October has reignited discussions surrounding the transitory nature of inflation. Many economists are cautioning that the long-term effects of the pandemic may lead to a more permanent shift in prices.\n\nThe surge in prices can be attributed to a combination of factors. Firstly, the unprecedented government and consumer spending during the pandemic has led to an increased demand for goods and services, resulting in higher prices, particularly in the retail sector. Additionally, shortages of key goods, such as semiconductors and shipping containers, have exacerbated the situation by tightening supply and driving up prices further.\n\nNot all economists, however, are convinced that the current price increases are merely a temporary phenomenon. Some believe that the underlying factors driving up prices, such as increased demand or supply disruptions, could become more entrenched, potentially leading to a persistent rise in inflation.\n\nThe long-term implications of the pandemic could also contribute to higher prices. Many businesses are operating under new costs and constraints, which could lead to higher prices for goods and services. Furthermore, the massive increase in government spending could stimulate the economy and drive up wages, further contributing to higher prices.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the situation and is prepared to take action if inflation starts to take hold. The central bank has already implemented a program of quantitative easing and has discussed the possibility of tapering its bond-buying program. Additionally, the Fed has tools at its disposal to temper inflation, such as decreasing the money supply or raising reserve requirements for banks.\n\nRegardless of the exact cause, many economists agree that higher prices will be a persistent feature of the economy in the near future. This means that consumers can expect higher prices for the foreseeable future, and businesses will need to adapt their pricing strategies to remain competitive.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "China's economy concluded the year with a downturn as virus outbreaks persisted and a sluggish rebound in manufacturing failed to compensate for a significant decline in consumer spending.\n\nGross domestic product in the world's second-largest economy decreased by 6.8% in 2020, the first annual contraction since the late 1970s and the largest in modern Chinese history. The decline was largely driven by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, with the travel and hospitality industries particularly suffering due to lockdowns and curfews.\n\nManufacturing output surged in the fourth quarter as factories returned to production and the government increased fiscal stimulus. However, while this lifted GDP into positive territory, the recovery was not sufficient to offset the pandemic's impact.\n\n\"The figures reveal how challenging it has been for the Chinese economy to recover from the pandemic and how much the virus has altered the way people conduct business and consume,\" said Zhao Yang, chief China economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Hong Kong. \"Consumption and services have been far slower to recover than manufacturing.\"\n\nThe recovery in Chinese services slowed in the fourth quarter, as an increase in coronavirus cases during the winter months weighed on retail and other businesses. Services activity dipped to a 19-month low in December, although it was still higher than a year earlier.\n\nThe economic data emerges amidst a deepening political crisis in Beijing. The government has implemented a security law in Hong Kong that critics argue violates the city's autonomy, prompting fresh tension with the U.S. and U.K.\n\nInvestors are also monitoring signs of a trade spat between the U.S. and China, which is expected to intensify in 2021. President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to adopt a \"firm\" stance on Beijing, and the Trump administration is expected to continue its tough line on China in the coming months.\n\nThe slowdown in services, combined with the trade spat, could hit the economy further in 2021, analysts said. China's leaders have sought to temper expectations, stating growth will be \"more restrained\" in 2021.\n\n\"The key question for 2021 is whether Chinese demand can support its economic expansion if trade tension persists and the recovery from the virus takes longer than expected,\" Zhao said.\n\nThe IMF has forecast that China's economy will grow 8.1% in 2021, the fastest pace among major economies. This is a much slower pace than before the pandemic, when growth had topped 6% for 10 consecutive years.\n\nThe outlook for the rest of the world remains uncertain. As of January 11, more than 88 million people worldwide had been infected with the virus, and nearly 1.9 million had died. Economies around the world remain in flux as governments and businesses grapple with the fallout from the pandemic.\n\nIn the U.S., an agreement on a new round of stimulus has been delayed amid congressional divisions, potentially leaving millions of Americans without aid. In Europe, a rapid resurgence of cases has forced a number of countries to impose strict new lockdowns, and the economic fallout from the virus has yet to be fully felt.\n\nDespite the global uncertainty, analysts said Chinese leaders are likely to be relieved that the world's second-biggest economy has avoided an even steeper decline this year.\n\n\"China has done incredibly well considering the context,\" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics Ltd. in Singapore. \"It's been very effective in containing the virus and the policy response has been very aggressive. That will help to underpin growth in 2021.\"", "label": "machine"}

Read our review Read Our Review A looong arrow, pointing right\n\nEV charging station credit card reviews\n\nBest overall credit card for EV charging stations: U.S. Bank Altitude\u00ae Connect Visa Signature\u00ae Card\n\nThe U.S. Bank Altitude\u00ae Connect Visa Signature\u00ae Card comes with a welcome bonus of 50,000 points after spending $2,000 in eligible purchases within the first 120 days from account opening. Altitude points are worth 1 cent each, no matter how you use them (cash back, gift cards, travel, etc.). That makes this bonus worth $500.\n\nThis is one of the only cards that specifically mention EV charging in its earnings rate. It treats these purchases exactly the same as gas. You'll receive:\n\n5 points per dollar for prepaid hotels and car rentals booked directly in the Altitude Rewards Center\n\n4 points per dollar on travel, at gas stations, and at EV charging stations\n\n2 points per dollar at grocery stores, grocery delivery, dining, and streaming services\n\n1 point per dollar everywhere else\n\nWith points worth 1 cent each in cash back, 4 points per dollar is effectively 4% cash back.\n\nThis card also offers a $30 annual streaming bonus toward Netflix, Apple TV+, Spotify, etc. And you'll get a statement credit to offset the application fee of Global Entry ($100) or TSA PreCheck ($78) once every four years. Membership lasts five years, so you'll get free membership as long as you have the card open.\n\nThe U.S. Bank Altitude\u00ae Connect Visa Signature\u00ae Card comes with an annual fee of $0 intro for the first year, then $95.\n\nReview: US Bank Altitude Connect Card review\n\nBest credit card if you shop at Costco: Costco Anywhere Visa\u00ae Card by Citi\n\nThe no-annual-fee Costco Anywhere Visa\u00ae Card by Citi has always been a great card for gas purchases, and it recently added EV charging as a bonus category. Cardholders earn:\n\n4% cash back on eligible gas and EV charging worldwide on up to $7,000 in spending each year (then 1%)\n\n3% cash back on restaurants and eligible travel purchases worldwide\n\n2% cash back on all other purchases from Costco and Costco.com\n\n1% cash back on all other eligible purchases\n\nEarning 4% back on EV charging and gas is a great deal if you prefer cash back. Keep in mind you must be a Costco member to qualify for the card, and using rewards is a little challenging. You can only redeem your cash back with this card after your February billing statement closes. At that time, you'll receive a \"reward certificate\" that you can redeem at a Costco warehouse for cash back or merchandise.\n\nThere's also a small-business version of this card \u2014 the Costco Anywhere Visa\u00ae Business Card by Citi \u2014 that offers similar reward rates and features.\n\nReviews: Costco Anywhere Visa Card review and Costco Anywhere Business Visa Card review\n\nBest credit card for mobile wallets at EV charging stations: U.S. Bank Altitude\u00ae Reserve Visa Infinite\u00ae Card\n\nThe U.S. Bank Altitude\u00ae Reserve Visa Infinite\u00ae Card comes with 50,000 points after you spend $4,500 on purchases in the first 90 days of account opening. These points are worth 1.5 cents toward travel, making this bonus worth $750 in travel.\n\nThis card doesn't (directly) offer electric vehicle charging stations as a bonus category. Here's what you'll get:\n\n5 points per dollar on prepaid hotels and car rentals booked directly in the Altitude Rewards Center\n\n3 points per dollar on eligible travel purchases and mobile wallet spending\n\n1 point per dollar for all other eligible purchases\n\nHere's the play: Stations like ChargePoint allow you to use contactless payment to foot the bill. Through the charging station's respective app, you can add your card via a mobile wallet like Apple Pay, Google Pay, etc. As long as your Altitude Reserve Card codes your purchase as occurring through a mobile wallet, you'll get 3 points per dollar for EV charging. Again, 3 points per dollar equal 3% cash back \u2014 or 4.5% back toward travel.\n\nNot all electric vehicle stations may take mobile wallets. Even if you pay through the proprietary app, you won't earn bonus rewards unless the transaction is processed with either Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay, or LG Pay.\n\nThis card incurs a $400 annual fee \u2014 but you'll get the following benefits:\n\nUp to $325 annual credit that reimburses travel and dining purchases\n\nUp to $100 statement credit every four years to offset the application fee for Global Entry/TSA PreCheck\n\n12-month Priority Pass Select membership (access to more than 1,300+ airport lounges worldwide)\n\nVisa Infinite benefits\n\nIf you'll both the Priority Pass Select membership and the $325 annual statement credit each year, this card is a steal. Just keep in mind that to qualify for this card, you must have an existing US Bank relationship, such as a savings or checking account.\n\nReview: US Bank Altitude Reserve review\n\nBest small-business credit card for EV charging stations: U.S. Bank Business Triple Cash Rewards World Elite Mastercard\u00ae\n\nThe U.S. Bank Business Triple Cash Rewards World Elite Mastercard\u00ae comes with $500 cash back after spending $4,500 on purchases on the account holder's card in the first 150 days of opening your account. That's unusually lucrative for a card with a $0 annual fee.\n\nThis card includes electric vehicle charging stations as a bonus category along with gas stations. Here's what you'll get:\n\n5% cash back on prepaid hotels and car rentals booked directly in the US Bank Rewards Center\n\n3% cash back at gas and EV charging stations\n\n3% cash back at office supply stores\n\n3% cash back on cell phone service providers\n\n3% cash back at restaurants\n\n1% cash back on all other eligible purchases\n\nBeyond that, you'll receive a $100 annual software credit, valid for eligible recurring business software subscriptions like FreshBooks or QuickBooks.

The Altitude points you earn with this card are worth 1 cent each. That means this bonus is worth $200 in travel.\n\nAgain, electric vehicle charging stations are specifically mentioned as a bonus category for this card. You'll receive:\n\n4x points on takeout, food delivery, and dining\n\n2x points at grocery stores, grocery delivery, streaming services, gas stations, and EV charging stations\n\n1 point per dollar on all other eligible purchases\n\nEarning 2 Altitude points per dollar is equal to earning 2% cash back.

FlexPoints are worth 1.5 cents each toward travel, making this bonus worth $450 in flights, hotels, car rentals, and more.\n\nThis card offers some of the highest returns in bonus categories, but its EV charging station category isn't noteworthy. Here's what you'll get:\n\n5 points per dollar on prepaid hotels and car rentals\n\n3 points per dollar on dining, takeout, and restaurant delivery\n\n2 points per dollar at airlines, gas stations, and EV charging stations\n\n1 point per dollar on all other eligible purchases\n\nWhile this card earns the same number of points as the $0-annual-fee U.S. Bank Altitude\u00ae Go Visa Signature\u00ae Card, its rewards are worth 50% more. Earning 2 points per dollar on EV charging stations amounts to a return of 3% in travel.\n\nYou can also redeem your points as a statement credit, but you'll only receive a value of 1 cent each.\n\nThis card has an $85 annual fee \u2014 but it also comes with:\n\nStatement credit for either Global Entry ($100) or TSA PreCheck ($78) every five years (membership is valid for five years)\n\nFree Boingo Wi-Fi\n\nAmex Offers**\n\nNo foreign transaction fees\n\nSecondary rental car insurance\n\nEmergency assistance and roadside assistance dispatch\n\nBest credit card for charging your electric vehicle at home: U.S. Bank Cash+\u00ae Visa Signature\u00ae Card\n\nThe U.S. Bank Cash+\u00ae Visa Signature\u00ae Card offers a $200 bonus after spending $1,000 in eligible purchases within the first 120 days of account opening.\n\nThis is purely a cash-back credit card that comes with the following return rates:\n\n5% cash back in two eligible categories of your choice, on up to $2,000 in combined spending each quarter (then 1%)\n\n2% cash back at grocery stores, gas stations, EV charging stations, or restaurants\n\n1% cash back on all other eligible purchases\n\nYou must choose your 2% cash-back category with this card \u2014 either gas stations and EV charging stations, grocery stores, or restaurants.

The card is a Visa Signature, so it will receive resultant perks such as roadside dispatch, travel and emergency assistance services, Visa Signature Concierge, etc.\n\nReview: US Bank Cash Plus card review\n\nBest for EV charging, if you're willing to join PenFed credit union: PenFed Platinum Rewards Visa Signature\u00ae Card\n\nYou'll need to be a member of the PenFed (Pentagon Federal) Credit Union to qualify for the PenFed Platinum Rewards Visa Signature\u00ae Card, but you don't need a military affiliation to join. All you'll need to do is open a savings account with a minimum of $5, and you can do this when you apply for the card.\n\nThe PenFed Platinum Rewards Visa Signature\u00ae Card earns at the following rates:\n\n5x points on gas purchases at the pump and at EV charging stations.\n\n3x points on groceries\n\n1 point per dollar on everything else with no caps\n\nUsing rewards can be a little complicated because the value of your points varies depending on what you redeem them for. Options include travel, gift cards, and merchandise, but there's no way to use points directly for cash back.\n\nReview: PenFed Platinum Rewards Visa card review\n\nChase Sapphire cards may also earn bonus rewards\n\nHistorically, select EV charging stations have been coded as \"travel\" purchases on the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae and Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card. These cards do not officially list EV charging stations in their bonus categories, so your results may vary. The Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae offers 3 points per dollar on general travel purchases, and the Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card offers 2 points per dollar.\n\nIf you find an EV charging station that codes as travel, it can also be reimbursed by the Chase Sapphire Reserve $300 annual travel credit to offset up to $300 in charges annually. But again, if you're visiting a station you haven't proven yourself, you may find your purchase code as something other than travel \u2014 in which case you'll earn 1 point per dollar.\n\nBonus: Save between 10% and 18% at Tesla EV charging stations\n\nIf you're willing to incorporate the stock market into your rewards-earning plan, you can receive 10% or more back on Tesla EV charging.\n\nM1 Owner's Rewards Card\n\nThe no-annual-fee M1 Owner's Rewards Card, issued by M1 Finance, offers bonus cash back at select merchants if you are also an investor in the brand and have an M1 Plus membership.

This card otherwise earns 1.5% back for purchases that land outside your investment brands.\n\nSave Wealth Premium Card\n\nThe Save Wealth Premium offers up to 18% back with Tesla (including Supercharger stations) \u2014 and you don't need to own Tesla stock to get the bonus.\n\nThe catch is that the rewards you earn are untraditional. When you spend on the card, Save will purchase stock on your behalf \u2014 enough to average an 18% return on your spending. You'll have to wait at least one year before you can request a cash-back deposit into your bank account.\n\nRead our review of the Save Wealth Premium credit card to learn exactly how this card works.\n\nElectric vehicle charging station credit cards frequently asked questions (FAQ)\n\nIs there an EV charging stations map?

But it is not the last peak of this cycle,\" he said. \"We are likely to see CPI lower, possibly negative in 2H 2023, and the US in recession by any definition.\"\n\nHe added: \"Fed will cut and government will stimulate. And we will have another inflation spike. It's not hard.\"\n\nInflation surged to a 40-year high of 9.1% in June and remained above 7% in November, well ahead of the US Federal Reserve's 2% target. The central bank reacted by hiking its base interest rate from near-zero to more than 4% and has signaled it will peak above 5% in 2023.\n\nHigher interest rates aim to dampen upward pressure on prices by discouraging spending, investing, and hiring. However, they can simultaneously erode corporate profits and sap economic growth, leading to declines in asset prices and ultimately, recession.\n\nBurry's view appears to be that inflation will cool and the economy will weaken in 2023, prompting the Fed to cut rates and the government to boost spending in an effort to spur growth \u2014 which, in turn, will drive up demand and prompt inflation to rise again.\n\nThe Scion Asset Management chief warned back in April 2020 that the post-pandemic reopening of the economy could spark higher inflation. He also flagged last year that American households were putting away less money each month, racking up debt, and were on track to virtually exhaust their savings by December \u2014 raising the prospect of a slump in consumer spending and a prolonged recession.\n\nBurry is best known for his billion-dollar wager against the mid-2000s housing bubble, which was immortalized in the book and movie \"The Big Short.\" He also bet against Elon Musk's Tesla and Cathie Wood's flagship Ark Innovation fund last year, and inadvertently laid the groundwork for the meme-stock craze by investing in GameStop before the stock skyrocketed at the start of 2021.\n\nMoreover, the Scion chief last summer sounded the alarm on the \"greatest speculative bubble of all time in all things,\" warning buyers of meme stocks and cryptocurrencies that they were barreling towards the \"mother of all crashes.\"\n\nHere's a screenshot of Burry's latest tweet:\n\nTwitter/@michaeljburry\n\nRead more: A Michael Burry expert breaks down what makes the 'Big Short' investor special.

{"text": "The new year should bring a boost to clean energy stocks, according to Raymond James. Despite solid underlying fundamentals, the sector had a dismal 2022 \u2014 the worst since the global financial crisis, analyst Pavel Molchanov said in a note Wednesday. The WilderHill Clean Energy Index lost 46% last year, he pointed out. Yet Raymond James is forecasting a 30% to 40% gain for the index this year. \"The demand side of the equation is emphatically not a culprit for the past year's underperformance. Demand drivers vary around the world, but there is strength everywhere,\" Molchanov wrote. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act is providing a \"wide-ranging catalyst for U.S. energy transition,\" he said. However, while supply chain conditions are improving, the risk is not over. Commodity prices and their impact on company margins are also still on the radar. \"In any case, on a day-to-day basis, these stocks tend to trade, for lack of a better word, emotionally: they are high-beta; driven by sentiment and momentum; and prone to relentless volatility, including sometimes for no apparent reason,\" Molchanov said. With that in mind, he upgraded two clean energy companies: Chart Industries to strong buy from market perform, and Maxeon Solar Technologies to outperform from market perform. Molchanov said his call on Chart Industries, which provides liquefied natural gas technology, services and equipment, was an \"opportunistic upgrade.\" The stock was at all-time highs in early November, but then lost half its value in \"mere days\" after the company announced it would acquire privately held Howden, a provider of air and gas handling solutions. The deal carries an outsized balance sheet risk and integration uncertainty, Molchanov noted. Therefore, this idea is for those who have a high degree of risk tolerance, he said. \"To be clear, we are not predicting that the stock will get back to its pre-Howden highs anytime soon. But we are of the view that the worst is in the rearview mirror. The financing package \u2014 a combination of secured and unsecured debt, and preferred and common equity \u2014 is locked in, so we no longer have to ponder what the cost of capital will be,\" Molchanov wrote. His $160 price target implies 39% upside from Tuesday's close. Chart Industries joins names such as Bloom Energy and FTC Solar on Raymond James' strong buy list. The firm is also bullish on Maxeon Solar. The stock got a bounce from the Inflation Reduction Act but is down nearly 40% from its 52-week high in September, Molchanov said. \"[As] a result of this recent weakness, the stock is no longer pricing in the longer-term uplift in profitability from the yet-to-be-clarified plan to establish a U.S. manufacturing footprint,\" he said. The startup of U.S. manufacturing is likely to be a 2025 story, he pointed out. However, the company's base business \u2014 manufacturing in Mexico, Malaysia and the Philippines \u2014 is attractively valued, he said. \"As we wait for details on the U.S. manufacturing roadmap \u2014 scale, location, timing, and source of funding \u2014 this should be regarded as 'icing on the cake,'\" he wrote. His $22 price target implies 44% upside from Tuesday's close. The firm also upgraded NextEra Energy to market perform from underperform, but noted it is not enthusiastic about the stock at these levels. Instead, the call is about yields, the Federal Reserve 's apparent conclusion of its most aggressive portion of interest rate hikes and the market's greater comfort level with the stabilizing rate environment, he said. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "A sudden turn of events has unfolded in Hong Kong, as the government has announced the revocation of a one-year-old restriction on importing hamsters from mainland China. The ban was initially put in place in late 2019 due to concerns about the potential transmission of a certain virus from animals to humans. \n\nIt is believed that the decision to lift the ban has been taken in response to a growing demand for hamsters as pets following the pandemic. Many people, having spent extended periods of time at home, have been seeking ways to reconnect with nature and hamsters are often cited as an excellent option for indoor companionship.\n\nAlthough the initial ban was welcomed by animal welfare organizations, experts cautioned that the long-term consequences could be severe. Unregulated breeding and smuggling of hamsters have increased in China, with reports of malnourished and mistreated animals.\n\n\"The lifting of the ban will provide a significant boost to the legitimate hamster trade, but it is crucial that authorities ensure all imports meet strict standards of animal welfare,\" said Eric Chow, a spokesperson for Animals Asia, an animal protection charity.\n\nHong Kong authorities have stated that they will implement strict regulations to guarantee that imported hamsters meet the highest possible animal welfare standards. They will also require all imported hamsters to undergo a three-week quarantine upon arrival to prevent any potential transmission of infection.\n\nThe decision has been met with both joy and concern from animal welfare campaigners. On the one hand, they are relieved that the ban has been lifted, as it will provide much-needed relief to hamster farmers in mainland China who are struggling due to the pandemic. On the other hand, they are worried that the regulations might not be strictly enforced and that smuggled and mistreated animals could still find their way into the city.\n\nLocal retailers in Hong Kong have already begun preparing for the arrival of the new hamsters, with some stores stocking up on cages, food, bedding, and other supplies. However, some shops are taking a more cautious approach, with some refusing to carry any hamsters until more information is available about their origin and health.\n\nIn summary, the news of the lifting of the hamster import ban in Hong Kong has been welcomed by animal lovers in the city, who are hoping that it will be possible to ensure strict welfare standards for the animals and prevent any further suffering. It remains to be seen if authorities in Hong Kong will be able to make this a reality, but with careful regulation, it should be possible to ensure that the introduction of hamsters is both safe and ethical.", "label": "machine"}

It was also able to avoid the staff shortages that plagued many of its rivals over the summer, including budget airline EasyJet.\n\nRyanair CEO Michael O\u2019Leary said cuts by rivals to fleets and passenger capacity have created \u201cenormous growth opportunities\u201d for the Irish carrier, which has seen its market share \u201csurge\u201d across major European markets.\n\n\u201cMillions of passengers are switching to flying Ryanair and we suspect that will continue,\u201d O\u2019Leary said in a video posted on the company\u2019s website.\n\nHe said that concerns about the impact of recession and inflation on Ryanair\u2019s business were \u201coverblown.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t stop flying during recessions, but they become much more price sensitive\u2026 Ryanair grows more strongly in a recession because we have a huge cost advantage over our competitors, that cost advantage is widening, and people becoming more price sensitive turn to us,\u201d he added.\n\nThe strong earnings mean the company will reverse pandemic pay cuts for over 90% of its pilots and cabin crew from next month \u2014 earlier than planned. \u201cThese long-term pay agreements with the vast majority of our people have now delivered fully restored pay 28 months earlier than previously agreed,\u201d O\u2019Leary said.\n\nWhile Ryanair has recovered from the pandemic faster than much of the aviation industry, its growth next year could be hampered by Boeing (BA)\u2019s \u201ccontinuing inability to meet its delivery schedule,\u201d according to O\u2019Leary.\n\nThe planemaker has promised to deliver all of the 51 \u201cGamechanger\u201d 737 aircraft Ryanair has ordered before next summer, but O\u2019Leary thinks there\u2019s a growing risk of \u201cslippage\u201d with these deliveries.\n\nKnown for his forthright manner, the airline boss described Boeing management as \u201cheadless chickens\u201d earlier this year in a scathing criticism of aircraft delays.\n\nDespite the strong results, O\u2019Leary said Ryanair\u2019s recovery remains \u201cfragile\u201d and \u201cprone to shocks\u201d from new Covid variants or the war in Ukraine.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "James Cameron's \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" has passed the billion-dollar mark at the global box office, but sluggish sales in China could weigh on the film's final haul.\n\nWorldwide ticket sales for the Disney film now stand at $1.03 billion, the combination of $317 million in domestic sales and $712 million from international markets.\n\nThe milestone comes 14 days after \"The Way of Water\" debuted in theaters, five days faster than \"Avatar\" achieved the same benchmark in 2009. That places the film among the top five fastest movies to reach $1 billion in box-office sales.\n\nCameron previously said \"The Way of Water\" would need to hit $2 billion in box-office receipts in order to be considered profitable.\n\nBox-office analysts believe Cameron's flick could hit the lofty goal. \"The Way of Water\" has no direct or significant competition in theaters until mid-February when \"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania\" is released.\n\nStill, industry experts are concerned by muted ticket sales from China. The market was expected to be a major source of revenue for the sequel, but has underperformed expectations as Covid once again roils the region.\n\nThrough Tuesday, China has accounted for just $108 million in ticket sales for the film. The country was expected to bring in $100 million in business during the film's opening weekend alone.\n\n\"The Way of Water\" is one of only a handful of Hollywood releases that have been permitted for a coveted release in China this year. China has become a dominant market in the global theatrical space and considered vital for blockbusters seeking top box-office numbers.\n\nHowever, early this month, China abruptly ended many Covid controls. Infections have surged and pressed the country's health-care system. At this point, it is unclear at what scale Covid outbreaks have hit the country, with few official figures on recent infections and deaths. China's National Health Commission on Sunday stopped sharing daily figures after a halt in mandatory virus testing.\n\n\"There were high hopes placed on the country to deliver the additional revenue needed to help put the film over the top in terms of the lofty global earnings expectations set forth by director James Cameron,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.\n\nDergarabedian said Cameron's traditional box-office trajectory works in the film's favor though, noting that previous releases like \"Titanic\" and the first \"Avatar\" had lengthy theatrical runs.\n\n\"Hopefully the troubling health situation will ease over time,\" he said.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nMars may seem like a dry, desolate place, but the red planet transforms into an otherworldly wonderland in winter, according to a new video shared by NASA.\n\nIt\u2019s late winter in Mars\u2019 Northern Hemisphere, where the Perseverance rover and Ingenuity helicopter are exploring an ancient river delta that once fed into Jezero Crater billions of years ago.\n\nAs the planet\u2019s main feature, dust also drives Martian weather. Dust usually heralds winter\u2019s arrival, but the planet is no stranger to snow, ice and frost. At the Martian poles, the temperature can dip as low as minus 190 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 123 degrees Celsius).\n\nThere are two types of snow on Mars. One is the kind we experience on Earth, made of frozen water. The thin Martian air and subzero temperatures mean that traditional snow sublimates, or transitions from a solid directly to a gas, before touching the ground on Mars.\n\nPatchy carbon dioxide frost, or dry ice, can be seen inside a crater during winter in the Martian Southern Hemisphere. NASA/JPL-Caltech/University of Arizona\n\nThe other type of Martian snow is carbon dioxide-based, or dry ice, and it can land on the surface. A few feet of snow tend to fall on Mars in its flat regions near the poles.\n\n\u201cEnough falls that you could snowshoe across it,\u201d said Sylvain Piqueux, a Mars scientist at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, in a statement from a NASA release. \u201cIf you were looking for skiing, though, you\u2019d have to go into a crater or cliffside, where snow could build up on a sloped surface.\u201d\n\nSo far, no orbiters or rovers have been able to see snow fall on the red planet because the weather phenomenon only occurs at the poles beneath cloud cover at night. The cameras on the orbiters can\u2019t peer through the clouds, and no robotic explorers have been developed that could survive the freezing temperatures at the poles.\n\nINTERACTIVE: Mars and other places to search for life in the solar system\n\nHowever, the Mars Climate Sounder instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter can detect light that\u2019s invisible to the human eye. It has made detections of carbon dioxide snow falling at the Martian poles. The Phoenix lander, which arrived on Mars in 2008, also used one of its laser instruments to detect water-ice snow from its spot about 1,000 miles (1,609 kilometers) away from the Martian north pole.\n\nThanks to photographers, we know snowflakes on Earth are unique and six-sided. Beneath a microscope, Martian snowflakes would likely look a little different.\n\n\u201cBecause carbon dioxide ice has a symmetry of four, we know dry-ice snowflakes would be cube-shaped,\u201d Piqueux said. \u201cThanks to the Mars Climate Sounder, we can tell these snowflakes would be smaller than the width of a human hair.\u201d\n\nThawing frost created unique patterns on Martian dunes during spring in July 2021. NASA/JPL-Caltech/University of Arizona\n\nIce and carbon dioxide-based frosts also form on Mars, and they can occur farther away from the poles. The Odyssey orbiter (which entered Mars\u2019 orbit in 2001) has watched frost forming and turning to a gas in the sunlight, while the Viking landers spotted icy frost on Mars when they arrived in the 1970s.\n\nAt the end of winter, the season\u2019s buildup of ice can thaw and turn into gas, creating unique shapes that have reminded NASA scientists of Swiss cheese, Dalmatian spots, fried eggs, spiders and other unusual formations.\n\nDuring winter in Jezero Crater, recent high temperatures have been about 8 F (minus 13 C), while lows been about minus 120 F (minus 84 C).\n\nMeanwhile, at Gale Crater in the Southern Hemisphere near the Martian equator, the Curiosity rover, which landed on Mars in 2012, has been experiencing highs of 5 F (minus 15 C) and lows of minus 105 F (minus 76 C).\n\nSeasons on Mars tend to last longer because the planet\u2019s oval-shaped orbit around the sun means that a single Martian year is 687 days, or nearly two Earth years.\n\nIce frozen in the soil left polygon patterns on the Martian surface. NASA/JPL-Caltech/University of Arizona\n\nNASA scientists celebrated the Mars new year on December 26, which coincided with the arrival of the spring equinox in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\n\u201cScientists count Mars years starting from the planet\u2019s northern spring equinox that occurred in 1955 \u2014 an arbitrary point to begin, but it\u2019s useful to have a system,\u201d according to a post on the NASA Mars Facebook page. \u201cNumbering Mars years helps scientists keep track of long term observations, like weather data collected by NASA spacecraft over the decades.\u201d", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The recent publication of the British Gymnastics Whyte report on June 21, 2022, has revealed a concerning environment where young athletes have been subjected to a \"culture of pressure\" and left vulnerable to exploitation. The report, led by Dame Lesley Whyte, was conducted following allegations of historic abuse in the sport and featured interviews with hundreds of former and current athletes.\n\nThe review paints a stark picture of an environment where bullying, harassment, and pressure to perform were rampant, with inadequate oversight by British Gymnastics to ensure the protection of children and young adults. The report highlights a culture of fear, lack of autonomy, and lack of support, which has been perpetuated by the sport itself.\n\nVictims of abuse felt betrayed by the organization and suffered in silence due to a culture of fear and humiliation. The review panel was critical of British Gymnastics' approach to safeguarding, noting a lack of emphasis on this area and inadequate procedures for dealing with allegations of abuse.\n\nThe panel's findings have led to recommendations for changes to protect athletes from abuse and harassment, including the introduction of an independent whistleblowing and advice line, revised disciplinary processes, and improved risk management procedures. The report also suggests that British Gymnastics provide additional training to coaches and clubs on bullying and harassment and establish a Code of Practice to support young athletes.\n\nThe report's release has prompted British Gymnastics to commit to taking action to protect the health and wellbeing of its athletes, promising to make changes to its policies and procedures. The organization's CEO has apologized to those affected and expressed a commitment to learning from the report's findings. It remains to be seen if British Gymnastics will follow through on its promise, but the report's revelations are a crucial step towards protecting future generations of athletes from the trauma suffered by those in the past.", "label": "machine"}

Courtesy: Miso Robotics\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill is testing whether a robot can make tortilla chips in stores. Sweetgreen plans to automate salad making in at least two locations. And Starbucks wants its coffee-making equipment to lessen the workload for baristas. This year brought a flurry of automation announcements in the restaurant industry as operators scrambled to find solutions to a shrinking workforce and climbing wages. But the efforts have been spotty so far, and experts say it will be years before robots pay off for companies or take the place of workers. \"I think there's a lot of experimentation that is going to lead us somewhere at some point, but we're still a very labor intensive, labor-driven industry,\" said David Henkes, a principal at Technomic, a restaurant research firm. Even before the Covid pandemic, restaurants were struggling to attract and retain workers. The global health crisis exacerbated the issue, as many laid-off workers left for other jobs and didn't return. Three-quarters of restaurant operators are facing staffing shortages that keep them from operating at full capacity, according to the National Restaurant Association. Many restaurant operators hiked wages to attract workers, but that pressured profits at a time when food costs were also climbing. Automation startups pitch themselves as a solution. They say that robots can flip burgers and assemble pizzas more consistently than overworked employees, and that artificial intelligence can enable computers to take drive-thru orders more accurately.\n\nThe year of the robot\n\nwatch now\n\nMany of the industry's buzzy automation announcements this year came from Miso Robotics, which has raised $108 million as of November and has a valuation of $523 million, according to Pitchbook. Miso's flashiest invention is Flippy, a robot that can be programmed to flip burgers or make chicken wings and can be rented for roughly $3,000 a month. Burger chain White Castle has installed Flippy at four of its restaurants and committed to adding the technology to 100 as it revamps locations. Chipotle Mexican Grill is testing the equipment, which it calls \"Chippy,\" at a California restaurant to make tortilla chips. \"The highest value benefit that we bring to a restaurant is not to reduce their expenses, but to allow them to sell more and generate a profit,\" Miso CEO Mike Bell told CNBC. At Buffalo Wild Wings, however, Flippy hasn't progressed out of the testing phase after more than a year. Parent company Inspire Brands, which is privately held and also owns Dunkin', Arby's and Sonic, said Miso is just one of the partners it has worked with to automate frying chicken wings. Another startup, Picnic Works, offers pizza assembly equipment that automates adding sauce, cheese and other toppings. A Domino's franchisee is testing the technology at a Berlin location. Picnic rents out its equipment, with prices starting at $3,250 a month. CEO Clayton Wood told CNBC that subscriptions make the technology affordable for smaller operators. The startup has raised $13.8 million at a valuation of $58.8 million, according to Pitchbook. At Panera Bread, automation experiments have included artificial intelligence software that can take drive-thru orders and a Miso system that checks coffee volume and temperatures to improve quality. \"Automation is one word, and a lot of people go right to robotics and a robot flipping burgers or making fries. That is not our focus,\" said George Hanson, the chain's chief digital officer But success is far from guaranteed. In early 2020, Zume pivoted from using robots to prep, cook and deliver pizza to focus on food packaging. The startup, which did not respond to a request for comment, received a $375 million investment from SoftBank in 2018 that reportedly valued it at $2.25 billion.\n\nThe labor question\n\nAutomation often faces pushback from workers and labor advocates, who see it as a way for employers to eliminate jobs. But restaurant companies have been touting their experiments as ways to improve working conditions by doing away with tedious tasks. Next year, Sweetgreen plans to open two locations that will largely automate the salad-making process with the technology it acquired by buying startup Spyce. The new restaurant format will cut down on the number of workers needed for shifts, Sweetgreen co-founder and Chief Concept Officer Nic Jammet said at the Morgan Stanley Global Retail and Consumer Conference in early December. Jammet also listed an improved employee experience and lower turnover rates as secondary benefits. A representative for Sweetgreen declined to comment for this story. Casey Warman, an economics professor at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, expects the restaurant industry's push for automation will permanently shrink its workforce. \"Once the machines are in place, they're not going to backwards, especially if there's large cost savings,\" he said. And Warman noted that Covid reduced the pushback against automation, as consumers got more used to self check-outs at grocery stores and mobile apps to order fast food. Dina Zemke, an assistant professor at Ball State University who studies consumer attitudes about automation in restaurants, also noted that consumers are getting tired of reduced restaurant hours and slower service that have come with labor shortages. In a Technomic survey conducted in the third quarter, 22% of roughly 500 restaurant operators said they are investing in technology that will save on kitchen labor and 19% said they've added labor-saving tech to front of house tasks such as ordering.\n\nLong-term skepticism\n\nAt this point, it's unclear if or when any cost savings will materialize. More than a year and a half ago, McDonald's began testing software that could take drive-thru orders after acquiring Apprente, an artificial intelligence startup. Several months after revealing the test, the fast-food giant sold the unit to IBM as part of a strategic partnership to further the technology. At the roughly two dozen Illinois test restaurants, the voice-ordering software had an accuracy in the low 80% range, well below the target of 95%, according to a research report from BTIG analyst Peter Saleh this June.\n\nMcDonald's crowds at self-service kiosk.

{"text": "No matter how smart or well educated you are, and no matter how successful professionally, when it comes to investing you still might not make the best decisions.\n\nThat\u2019s because you\u2019re human, which means you\u2019re hardwired to respond in certain ways that serve you well in many parts of your life, but tend to work against you when it comes to making smart investment decisions, according to psychologist Daniel Crosby, author of \u201cThe Behavioral Investor.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot only is high intelligence not an insulation [against bad financial decisions], it might be a red flag,\u201d Crosby said.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: If you\u2019re aware of your mediocrity when it comes to the markets, it can actually help you be a better investor.\n\nBased on decades of leading behavioral research, Crosby said investors easily fall prey to four inherent biases. But when you\u2019re mindful of them you can take steps to either mute their effect, or harness them to your financial advantage.\n\n1. Ego bias\n\nEveryone has an ego. It protects us in many ways, in part by creating a sense of confidence \u2013 and often overconfidence \u2013 in our own abilities and judgments.\n\n\u201cEgo gets us out of bed in the morning,\u201d Crosby said.\n\nThose who become very sure of themselves are more likely to be resilient and find professional success. \u201cPeople who are overconfident are often happier and more likely to be successful business people and politicians. And [a strong] ego can buffer us against setbacks, disappointment and loss,\u201d he said.\n\nBut when it comes to investing, too much self-confidence can cost you real money.\n\nFor example, Crosby said, most of us would rather find information that confirms what we already believe rather than seek out information that challenges our beliefs. He cited research showing that even when presented with facts that directly contradict what we believe, thanks to our ego, we may become even more entrenched in those faulty beliefs.\n\nOne way this might play out when you\u2019re investing is that you may feel sure that a given company or new asset class \u2013 like crypto \u2013 will win the future. So you throw a disproportionately large amount of money at your can\u2019t-lose-idea.\n\nBut research suggests cherry-picking what you believe to be future winners in place of investing in the broader market may hurt your returns in the long run. Crosby cited statistics showing how active stock fund management performed less well than passive indexing more than 80% of the time over five- and 10-year periods. And that\u2019s before accounting for the higher fees an investor pays for actively managed funds.\n\n2. Conservatism bias\n\nInvesting always involves risk. But people\u2019s desire to stick with the familiar or take the adage \u201cinvest in what you know\u201d too far can actually increase that risk.\n\nCrosby used an example of someone who works in the tech industry, buys a home in a tech hub like San Francisco and invests primarily in tech stocks. The upshot: Her financial prospects will be disproportionately dependent on the health of the tech sector because she is devoting most of her time and money to it through her job, her property and her portfolio. When the tech sector takes a hit, she could get clobbered financially.\n\nAnother way investors often default to the familiar is to primarily invest in US stocks in the belief that non-US stocks are too risky.\n\n3. Attention bias\n\nHumans tend to pay disproportionate attention to bad news or high-drama, low-probability events (e.g., shark attacks or planes flying into buildings). Both can distort our perception of risk.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, information overload \u2013 whether from data or research or news \u2013 can lead to misguided decisions because too much information makes it hard to see the forest for the trees, Crosby noted.\n\n4. Emotion bias\n\nOur emotions and intuition can protect us in some difficult situations, or they can help guide us. For instance,you might finally pick a good partner after years of dating others who were never quite right for you.\n\nBut they can also cause us to act rashly in the moment, and override what we normally know we should do.\n\nThink donuts, Crosby suggested. You may have gotten all the nutritional counseling in the world, but under peak stress you will invariably reach for the powdered donuts, not the asparagus.\n\nHow emotion plays out in the markets can be costly. If your fear is activated, you can panic and sell at the wrong time. Or if you\u2019re elated, your optimism may distort your sense of how much risk you\u2019re really taking on with an investment.\n\nStrategies to beat back our biases\n\nInvestors can seek to override their inherent biases in many ways, Crosby said. Among his suggested strategies:\n\nTune out the noise. Don\u2019t check your investment accounts daily. Don\u2019t fixate on every gyration in the market. Don\u2019t drown yourself in metrics. And don\u2019t let negative events disproportionately drive your investment decisions.\n\nHave humility. You can\u2019t predict the future. And you will never have perfect information to make a sure bet on a single stock or sector.\n\nDiversify your holdings. Crosby put it this way in his book: \u201cDiversification is \u2026 the embodiment of managing ego risk. [It]\u2019s a concrete nod to the luck and uncertainty inherent in money management and an admission that the future is unknowable.\u201d\n\nFor example, to counter so-called home bias in your investments, Crosby suggested you shouldn\u2019t invest much more in domestic stocks than their percentage of the world market. Depending on how they\u2019re measured, US equities represent anywhere from 45% to 60% of the global equity market. But average US investors typically have a much larger share of their equity holdings in US companies, and very little in foreign stocks.\n\nPut a system in place. Automating your savings and investing across a diverse portfolio regardless of market conditions often works well. The same goes for automatically putting away a certain amount of savings for near-term goals and emergencies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s less about the perfect process and more about having a process,\u201d Crosby said.\n\nOne example is the idea of \u201cset it and forget it\u201d with retirement savings. Employees who choose the option in their 401(k) plan to automatically increase their savings whenever they get a raise do better than if they have to make decisions every month about how much to save.\n\nUse emotions to your financial advantage: One study Crosby cited showed that low-income parents were likely to save twice as much money when they had an envelope earmarked for savings that has a picture of their children on it.\n\nRealize no investment is perfect. Many people get their exposure to the stock market through their 401(k)s, specifically through target date funds that their employers offer as the default investment.\n\nWhile target date funds have their critics, Crosby said, \u201cEvery investment is imperfect. \u2026 And [target date funds] are so much better for the average person than what the average person is doing.\u201d", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Camera drones have made the skies a virtual playground for creators. For a few hundred dollars, a photographer or vlogger can pick up a quality quadcopter for aerial shots. Before drones went mainstream you'd have to take your self and your camera up into a helicopter, putting life and limb at risk, not to mention the cost of flight time.\n\nBut drones are good for more than just snapping pretty pictures. Autel, one of a handful of makers producing high-quality UAVs for the consumer market, has long supported industry and first responders. Its latest model, on display today at CES, is pointed right at that market too. The Autel EVO Max 4T is built for industry, first responders, and other technical applications\u2014it's not a cinema drone.\n\nTriple-Camera Lens in a Folding Drone\n\nThe EVO Max 4T sports a folding design, so it's not as big a deal to store or transport when compared to industrial drones like the six-rotor DJI Matrice series. There's some benefit there for first responders who may want to keep one in a response vehicle, as an example. And even though the drone is pretty small\u2014about 1.5 feet from motor to motor and 3.3 pounds\u2014its nose-mounted camera module includes three discrete lenses.\n\nEach lens does something a little different. The Wide Camera offers 50MP resolution and 4K30 video support, with image processing tuned to prioritize detail in dim light, and a very high sensitivity (ISO 64000) capability if you want it. A Moonlight photo mode is there if you prefer a lower noise and wider dynamic range look for photos.\n\n(Credit: Jim Fisher)\n\nThe Zoom camera is right next door. It supports 8K video with an angle of view that's 10 times tighter than what the Wide camera sees. When paired with a digital zoom (160x), Autel says the drone is capable of resolving clear detail with a 1.24-mile object distance. It's a good fit for bridge and tower inspections, as well as search-and-rescue.\n\nThe Thermal camera represents the final lens. It includes a 640-by-512 (0.3MP) thermal sensor with support for 30fps recording and up to 16x digital zoom. Thermal cameras are handy for finding warm objects from the air, an obvious use case for rescue teams, and is also something you can use for inspections and energy use audits. A thermal camera will tell you if there's need to replace your home's windows to cut down your heating bill.\n\nAll three lenses are integrated into the same gimbal-mounted chassis. The three-axis stabilizer is a proven piece of tech that delivers steady video from the air. The Max 4T also has a Laser Rangefinder with a three-quarter-mile range. It's able to tell you the distance between the drone and an object, a feature that's useful for industrial inspectors and surveyors.\n\nWorks in Rough Weather\n\nThe compact build also comes in handy for use in crowded environments. If you're using the drone to search for a missing hiker in the deep woods, all-around obstacle avoidance comes in handy. The Max 4T surrounds itself with obstacle sensors and is able to map environments and autonomously navigate around obstructions.\n\nYou can also take the drone up in tough weather, a must-have feature for emergency situations. The Max 4T is IP43 rated for use in rainy weather, and can handle 27mph winds, and can fly at up to 23,000 feet above sea level. A 12.4-mile transmission range, 42-minute battery, and pre-planned mission capabilities round things out.\n\n(Credit: Jim Fisher)\n\nAutel is also paying attention to radio interference issues. Drones are often used to inspect cellular towers, but basic models are thrown off by the ultra-powerful transponders that power our 5G networks. The SkyLink 3.0 remote system supports four bands, AES-256 encryption, and uses six antennas to keep a steady signal between drone and remote.\n\nMulti-drone operators will want to try out the A-Mesh feature too. Multiple EVO Max 4T aircraft come together to form a mesh network. The drones talk to each other, relay information, and can rely on permanent on-ground infrastructure to support Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BLVOS) operations.\n\nAccessories and Pricing\n\nAutel is bringing out three accessories for the EVO Max 4T. The first is the remote control, the Autel Smart Controller V3, with an integrated 7.9-inch, 2,000-nit display. The Live Deck 2 is used to share automated drone mission data with team members; it can send video from the cameras to monitors or smart devices wirelessly. Finally there's an RTK Module, which adds centimeter-accurate mapping capability to the drone.\n\nThe EVO Max 4T is making its debut today at Autel's CES booth. We don't know exact pricing yet, but a representative from the company tells PCMag that it expects the drone to sell in the $7,000 to $9,000 range.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "A notable enhancement has been introduced to Google Maps, significantly amplifying its navigation capabilities for individuals operating electric vehicles (EVs). The updated features, accessible on both iOS and Android devices, grant users access to a range of novel tools that facilitate the discovery of charging stations and provide real-time pricing information.\n\nThe timing of this update coincides with a surge in demand for EV charging infrastructure in the United States. As the popularity of electric vehicles continues to grow, with over two million units in use nationwide, Google Maps has responded by incorporating new features that enable users to swiftly and effortlessly locate available charging stations.\n\nWhen searching for a charging station, users will now be able to visualize a \"charging station layer\" that highlights various levels of charging stations. Additionally, they will have access to real-time updates on the station's availability and pricing information.\n\nFurthermore, Google Maps now accommodates both AC and DC fast-charging systems, allowing users to effortlessly identify the fastest charging speed their EV can handle and locate stations offering the fastest charging speeds. The update also grants users the ability to compare charging stations based on price, features, and availability.\n\nAlongside the charging station updates, Google Maps has introduced a novel \"EV Journey Planner\" feature. This feature provides users with a recommended route that takes into account their EV's battery range, as well as the location and availability of charging stations. Users can also input a specific time frame for their journey, and the route will automatically adjust to ensure their EV has sufficient power to reach their destination.\n\nGoogle Maps has also refined its EV charging station search capabilities. Users now have access to detailed information about each station, including the type of charging technology available, the number of outlets, and estimated charging times. This facilitates informed decision-making when selecting a charging station.\n\nThe updates to Google Maps are a welcome addition for EV drivers, providing them with the tools and information necessary to make EV ownership more convenient and accessible. As more individuals turn to electric vehicles as their primary mode of transportation, the new features will empower EV drivers to confidently locate the best charging station and optimize their EV journeys.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Lenovo jumped into CES 2023 head first with a huge range of new products, including smart ThinkPads, flexible YogaBooks, and game-winning Legion gear, but none of these is as interesting as the ThinkPhone, the company's first real foray into the enterprise smartphone space. There's also the Lenovo Tab Extreme, a hulking Android tablet, along with the Lenovo Smart Paper E Ink-based note-taking slate. All three mark a curious, fresh direction for Lenovo's business group.\n\nThinking Different\n\nLenovo has long applied the Think brand to its top-of-the-line business notebooks. In fact, the ThinkPad is synonymous with enterprise computing. Lenovo finally had a new thought. How about bringing the same secure-and-productive thinking to its Motorola-made smartphones? Thus was born the Lenovo ThinkPhone by Motorola, a smartphone \"engineered to bring businesses a smartphone experience with the same trusted quality and reliability present on every Lenovo Think-branded device.\"\n\n(Credit: Emily Dreibelbis)\n\nThe ThinkPhone mimics the look of the ThinkPad X1 Carbon thanks to its carbon fiber rear panel, black aluminum framing, and stripped-down looks. Don't let the straight-forward appearance fool you, this phone is all business. It boasts an IP68 rating for protection against dust and water\u2014a feature many Motorola smartphones sorely lack. Moreover, it is MIL-STD 810H certified, which means it can handle salt fog, drops, temperature extremes, high elevations, and other physical abuses. The Gorilla Glass Victus front panel helps keep the display protected, as well. Let's not forget the customizable red key, a side-mounted button that can be configured to launch any app with a quick press.\n\n(Credit: Emily Dreibelbis)\n\nIt's not just tough on the outside. For example, it meets FIPS-140 and includes a tamperproof layer of hardware security, called Moto KeySafe, that ensures your most sensitive data\u2014PINs, passwords, crypto keys\u2014are stored safely in a protected vault. The phone is always in a secure state upon boot, which should circumvent attempts at rooting. Other IT tools include ThinkShield, Moto Secure, Moto OEMConfig, and Moto Device Manager, all of which allow IT admins to remotely configure IT policies and deploy them to large numbers of employees with zero touch.\n\nAs far as specs and performance are concerned, the ThinkPhone is one of the best-equipped phones to come from Motorola in years. It has a 6.6-inch pOLED display with Full HD+ resolution, 10-bit color, and a fast 144Hz refresh rate. It is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 Mobile Platform and can be configured with either 8GB or 12GB of LPDDR5x RAM and with 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB of UFS 3.1 storage. You'll find support for dual nano SIMs on board, a high-speed USB-C port with DisplayPort out, and Dolby Atmos stereo speakers. A 5,000mAh battery should provide more than a full day of life, and it can be recharged rapidly thanks to support for 68W wired charging and 15W wireless charging.\n\n(Credit: Emily Dreibelbis)\n\nThe cameras look good on paper. The main shooter has a 50MP sensor with an f/1.8 aperture, quad-pixel binning technology, and optical image stabilization. It shoots up to 8K30 video, including 4K30 in HDR10 and slow motion at up to 960fps in Full HD. There's a 13MP ultra-wide camera on the rear that supports macro shooting, along with a depth sensor to help with portrait imaging. The selfie camera packs 32MP with an f/2.45 aperture and quad-pixel tech for enriched 8MP images.\n\nWireless support is no joke. It covers the 2G/3G/4G gamut and supports sub-6GHz 5G as well, though no mmWave. The latest Wi-Fi 6E spec is on board for the best WLAN speeds, and Bluetooth 5.2 ensures solid connections to Bluetooth accessories.\n\nThe phone ships with Android 13 and, critically, comes with four years of software support, including monthly security patches. Microsoft Office, OneDrive, and Outlook are all on board to help with enterprise communications and productivity, and the phone can present a PC-like screen to external monitors thanks to Motorola's Ready For software.\n\n(Credit: Emily Dreibelbis)\n\nThis all makes for a solid smartphone, but it's really only the beginning. Lenovo had its smartphone and laptop teams work together to ensure that the ThinkPhone and ThinkPad are bosom buddies with its Think 2 Think services. This include Instant Connect, for seamless Wi-Fi pairing between the two; Unified Clipboard, for transferring copied text or photos from phone to laptop and vice versa; Unified Notifications, for pop-ups that appear on the laptop; File Drop, for dragging and dropping files between the ThinkPhone and PC; App Streaming, for opening Android apps on a ThinkPad; Advanced Webcam, to use the phone as a webcam; and Instant Hotspot, for instantly connecting the ThinkPad to the internet through the phone's data service.\n\nThe Lenovo ThinkPhone by Motorola will be available in the US, Europe, Latin America, Middle East, Australia, and select Asian countries in the coming months. Pricing wasn't revealed, and sales are most likely going to be limited to enterprise channels. This last point is a shame. While the ThinkPhone is clearly an enterprise play, it's perhaps the most exciting phone to come from Motorola in the last five years. Surely some Motorola fans would love to be able to get their hands on one, despite its business-first leanings.\n\nTaking Tablets to the Extreme\n\nMost Android tablet screens top out around the 13-inch mark. With the Lenovo Tab Extreme, the company claims to be \"breaking the mold\" for premium tablets and at first glance it appears that Lenovo isn't exaggerating.\n\n(Credit: Emily Dreibelbis)\n\nThe slate is made from 100% recycled aluminum and has the standard Lenovo two-tone finish on the rear. It measures 12.29 by 8.29 by 0.23 inches (HWD) and weighs 1.63 pounds. It's a platter-sized piece of tech.\n\nThis monster of a tablet features a 14.5-inch, 3K OLED screen (3,000 by 1,876 pixels) with a DCI-P3 color gamut and a 120Hz refresh rate. To put that into perspective, Apple's largest iPad Pro has a 12.9-inch screen. That extra 1.6 inches of screen real estate means Tab Extreme owners will have a large canvas for browsing the web, editing documents, or watching videos\u2014or doing all three at once. The display has a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio with HDR10+ and Dolby Vision for bright whites, deep blacks, and wide color. Rounding out this portable home theater's entertainment specs, it's got eight JBL four-channel speakers split between woofers and tweeters to create spatial audio sound fields, all tuned with Dolby Atmos.\n\nThe Tab Extreme is powered by an octa-core MediaTek Dimensity 9000 processor. Notably, it features an Arm Cortex-X2 core at 3.05GHz for raw power, along with three A710 cores at 2.85GHz for everyday computing tasks, and four A510 cores at 1.8GHz for low-power needs. The tablet ships with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. A massive 12,300mAh battery can push the tablet through 12 hours of video playback, according to Lenovo, and it ships with a high-speed 68W charging brick in the box.\n\n(Credit: Emily Dreibelbis)\n\nSome of the connectivity tools you expect from a pro machine are accounted for. The tablet has two USB-C ports, with one 3.2 Gen 1 with DisplayPort out and the other version 2.0. There's also a microSD card slot to expand storage should you need to. Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 are both on board, as is support for the Lenovo Precision Pen 3, and Tab Extreme Keyboard and Tab Extreme Folio Case (sold separately). There doesn't appear to be a 4G/5G-connected variant, however, which is surprising.\n\nA 13MP front camera with a wide angle of view should help with Zoom calls, while a 13MP and 5MP duo on the rear can handle basic picture-taking duties. A fingerprint reader is built into the power button for biometric security. There are also four directional microphones with 360-degree voice capture for multiple-participant speakerphone calls.\n\nThe Tab Extreme ships with Android 13 and Lenovo says it will receive three full OS upgrades and four years of security patches. A handful of productivity apps are built in, as well as Clip Studio Paint for creative purposes.\n\nThe price is as extreme as the name. The tablet starts at $1,199.99 and it will ship later this year.\n\nTargeting Note-Takers\n\nWith the Lenovo Smart Paper, the company seeks to bring prolific note-takers into its fold. This E Ink-based tablet could be just what some pros or students need to stay on top of their game.\n\n(Credit: Emily Dreibelbis)\n\nThe Smart Paper has a 10.3-inch, anti-glare E Ink touch screen that's nestled into a metal chassis that is still light enough to be an everyday carry item. The monochrome screen's resolution measures 1,872 by 1,404 pixels for a density of 227ppi. There are 24 separate brightness levels as well as 24 adjustable temperature tones to find the right match for the note-taking or reading environment.\n\nLenovo says the screen mimics the pen-on-paper feel note takers are used to. It supports 4,096 levels of pressure and tilt detection with the Lenovo Smart Paper Pen\u2014which never has to be charged. There are nine different pen settings, including ballpoint, pencil, marker, and more. There are also 74 notepad templates for writing, drawing, sketching, shading, and illustrating. PCMag's Emily Dreibelbis commented that it sort of felt like writing on sandpaper.\n\nThe Smart Paper is powered by a RockChip RK3566 quad-core processor with 4GB of RAM and 64B of storage. You'll find a 3,550mAh battery within, which Lenovo claims is good for 7,000 pages worth of reading or 170 pages of note-taking in one charge. A USB-C port is on board for charging. Wi-Fi is available for syncing, and Bluetooth 5.2 with Low Energy helps it connect to select accessories.\n\n(Credit: Emily Dreibelbis)\n\nThe device, which of course doubles as an ereader, runs the Android Open Source Project build of Android 11. It includes some basic apps such as email, calendar, clock, calculator, and eBooks.com. There are two integrated microphones, which can help transform digital voice recordings to written notes. The user-available storage is enough to hold 50,000 note pages. The device can be synced with Android, iOS, and Windows devices when it comes time to manage content.\n\nPricing will start at $399.99 and the Lenovo Smart Paper will reach store shelves later in 2023.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The United States embassy in Havana, Cuba has declared the restarting of comprehensive processing of immigrant visas, a significant diplomatic shift since the re-establishment of diplomatic relations in December 2014.\n\nThis move signifies a strengthening of ties between the two nations, along with the recent announcement of limited direct flights. The resumption of full processing of immigrant visas, combined with the expansion of people-to-people exchanges, will enable U.S. citizens to apply for visas without needing to travel to a third country for an interview with the State Department.\n\nThis development will also facilitate the application process for family reunification visas in Cuba, which could have a profound impact on Cuban American families who have been separated since the 1960s when the U.S. imposed an embargo on Cuba, prohibiting travel to the country.\n\nU.S. Embassy officials claim that the application process has become significantly simpler due to the new measures. \"The process for applications for family reunification and other permanent residence visas is much less complicated than before,\" stated a State Department official. \"We no longer require applicants to travel to third countries for their applications to be considered.\"\n\nThe official added that the State Department is actively working with the Cuban government to ensure that applications are reviewed in a timely manner and that there are no disruptions in the process. The State Department also mentioned that they are now operating on a regular basis, with most of the process being automated.\n\nFor many families, this will mean a long-awaited reunion. \"I'm thrilled to know that my relatives in Cuba can come to visit me in the U.S.,\" said Maria Lopez, a Cuban-American living in Miami. \"We've been waiting for this for a long time, and now it's finally happening.\"\n\nThe resumption of full visa processing is a milestone in the evolving relationship between the U.S. and Cuba. It is a sign that the two countries are making progress towards better relations and greater openness. While there are still many issues to be resolved between the two countries, this is an important step forward for Cuban-Americans who are eager to reunite with their families.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The Inflation Reduction Act signed into law last year could create a boost for stocks from various sectors, and Goldman Sachs broke down its top picks for investors wanting to take advantage. \"We believe stock-specific implications are quite wide-ranging from both an impact and timing perspective across multiple sectors,\" Goldman strategists said in a note. The Wall Street firm screened buy-rated stock ideas \u2014 with many having 50% upside \u2014 from not only clear-cut winners like clean technology, hydrogen and electric vehicles, but also more underappreciated sectors like energy services and financials. Here are the criteria Goldman looked at for IRA plays: Percentage of sales derived in U.S. Percentage of sales benefiting from IRA IRA impact on earnings per share, EBITDA and free cash flow Goldman noted that the IRA marks a meaningful policy development for the solar and energy storage sector and clears the way for a decadelong runway for stable installation growth. First Solar and Enphase were the two top picks in this space, with Goldman predicting 50% upside in the next 12 months for both names. The bill also gives rise to the clean hydrogen economy in the U.S., including carbon capture, Goldman said. The firm highlighted Linde as a top beneficiary. \"For the first time [it] gives hydrogen a strong foundation to play a significant role in the energy system of the country,\" the strategists said. \"We view these incentives together as a major game changer for the sequestration of carbon and production of hydrogen and are a significant benefit for companies with current or planned hydrogen projects in the U.S.\" Electric vehicle players Freyr and Tesla could also be big winners as the law promotes long-term EV adoption while also driving down battery costs, Goldman said. For underappreciated names, Goldman said alternative asset manager Brookfield could be getting a boost as the company is building out its renewables flagship lineup. Meanwhile, Goldman said energy services company MasTec is well positioned to benefit from the demand for infrastructure that supports renewable projects. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting", "label": "human"}
{"text": "It\u2019s also worth putting the amount of carbon involved in having a Christmas tree in context. The Carbon Trust estimates that a 2m-tall (6.6ft) Christmas tree burnt after use emits only 3.5kg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) \u2013 roughly 0.2% of the emissions from a return flight from London to New York. A tree of the same size that ends up in landfill has a carbon footprint of 16kg of CO2e \u2013 equivalent to 1% of that return flight, or roughly two hamburgers.\n\nHow people dispose of their Christmas trees after use is usually the single most important carbon consideration. The worst-case scenario happens when Christmas trees end up in landfill: the anaerobic conditions are conducive to the same carbon being released as methane \u2013 a greenhouse gas some 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide on a 20-year timescale. Whether or not a tree ends up in landfill has by far the largest impact on its carbon footprint: a tree that ends up in landfill emits some 4-5 times as much carbon as one that doesn\u2019t, according to Carbon Trust figures.\n\nIdeally, if a tree is still alive with its roots, it will be replanted. A decent alternative is ensuring the tree's carbon is released slowly back to the atmosphere as CO2 \u2013 as happens if the tree is chipped and spread on a garden or park, or composted. If the tree is burned for energy, meanwhile, the carbon it contains will be emitted straight back to the atmosphere as CO2. The BCTGA also recommends checking whether the place you bought the tree from offers recycling services, allowing it to be chipped and returned to the fields where it grew.\n\nWhole trees can even be used as habitat restoration tools on riverbanks and along shorelines to prevent erosion. In Vermont, where old Christmas trees are used for everything from biomass burning for energy to goat food, \"we're also seeing folks using them in stream restoration,\" says Kosiba. \"They're great at catching dirt and debris, and creating little barriers and pools for fish: a lot of it is mimicking what a beaver would do.\"\n\nAside from disposal, Christmas trees produce greenhouse gases through the fertilisers used to grow them, which are made using fossil fuels and produce nitrous oxide, another powerful greenhouse gas. Meanwhile, managing and harvesting the forests uses fuel, as does transporting the trees to their final location.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Of course, the sights of the sport\u2019s brutality are simply the aspect of this questionable moral arrangement that we bear witness to on game day. Many of football\u2019s most serious dangers are abstracted or unseen. They arrive years later in the form of players suffering from premature dementia, violent mood swings, and suicidal depression. Off the field and away from the action, these are the blemishes that can be hidden away from the tens of millions who watch religiously for a third of the year.\n\n\n\nNaturally, the players understand the risks, but it\u2019s the league\u2019s sheer momentum and ruthless competitiveness\u2014these most American qualities\u2014that renders so many of the players who take these risks expendable, both physically and economically. Last night, ESPN\u2014after minutes of faltering coverage\u2014aired what may have been its most clear-eyed assessment of the dangers of football. Here is what former All-Pro safety Ryan Clark, whose career ended prematurely after he collapsed on a plane due to complications involving the sport and a genetic disorder, had to say on ESPN.\n\n\n\nWhen Damar Hamlin falls to the turf, and when you see the medical staff rush to the field and both teams are on the field, you realize this isn\u2019t normal. You realize this isn\u2019t just football. So many times in this game, and in our job as well, we use the clich\u00e9s: \u201cI\u2019m ready to die for this. I\u2019m willing to give my life for this. It\u2019s time to go to war.\u201d And I think sometimes we use those things so much, we forget that part of living this dream is putting your life at risk. Tonight, we got to see a side of football that is extremely ugly. A side of football that no one ever wants to see and never wants to admit exists. When you see both teams on the field crying in that way, your first thought is Damar Hamlin, your second thought is his family. This isn\u2019t about a football player. This is about a human. This is about a brother. This is about a son. This is about a friend. This is about someone who is loved by so many that you have to watch go through this.\n\nWhat we\u2019ve seen since Hamlin collapsed has run the gamut, exposing all that\u2019s good and ill about this league. The outpouring of support for Hamlin\u2014a hardworking and charitably-minded sixth-round draft pick who has quietly been one of the league\u2019s best success stories this year\u2014has been moving and extraordinary. We are reminded that players who are often treated either as superhumans or as mindless automatons, who come in for hours of abuse on inane morning TV shows, are human beings. That it seems highly likely that the game was ultimately suspended because of collective action from players and coaches who refused to play another down after watching one of their friends and colleagues collapse is similarly moving. But those players and coaches could only halt things momentarily. The sport\u2014and its attendant, inherent costs\u2014will start up again soon and the league will roll on, with or without Damar Hamlin.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The fusion of two colossal entities in the technological sphere has created a seismic shockwave, as Microsoft and Activision announced a colossal $69 billion amalgamation. This unprecedented union has sparked both jubilation and trepidation among industry aficionados.\n\nAs the dust settles, one figure has emerged as a central protagonist in this narrative: Lina Khan. This astute lawyer has been a fervent advocate for regulatory bodies to adopt a more stringent approach to mergers, and the Microsoft-Activision deal represents a direct challenge to her vision.\n\nKhan has been at the forefront of a movement aimed at curbing the dominance of the largest tech companies, and this merger serves as a direct affront to her ideals. However, it also presents a tantalizing opportunity for her to shape the regulatory landscape. If Khan can successfully thwart the Microsoft-Activision deal, she will establish a precedent that will reverberate throughout the industry for years to come.\n\nIn recent years, Khan has garnered recognition as a steadfast proponent of stricter antitrust laws. She has been a vocal critic of mergers and acquisitions, arguing that these transactions create an imbalance of bargaining power that ultimately harms consumers.\n\nThe Microsoft-Activision deal offers Khan a chance to put her convictions into practice. If she can successfully block the merger, it will send a powerful signal to regulators and the public that Big Tech deals must be taken seriously.\n\nKhan faces a formidable opponent in Microsoft, one of the largest companies in the tech industry, and Activision, a formidable force in its own right. The combined entity would boast a market capitalization of over $400 billion and control over a lucrative gaming market.\n\nUndeterred, Khan has spoken out against the deal, arguing that it will lead to reduced choice and higher prices for gamers. She has also highlighted the potential for the combined company to wield an unfair advantage in the gaming industry, stifling competition.\n\nAs the debate raged on, regulators seemed to take Khan's arguments to heart. The Department of Justice and the European Commission launched investigations into the deal, and the New York Attorney General threatened to file a lawsuit.\n\nIn the end, the investigations and threats of legal action proved effective. Microsoft and Activision abandoned the deal, citing \"regulatory concerns.\" The companies paid a combined $1 billion in fines, with most of the money going to the government.\n\nFor Khan, this represents a major triumph. While she has yet to win a significant antitrust case, she has demonstrated the power of public pressure. Her advocacy played a crucial role in thwarting the deal, and it signals that her views on antitrust are gaining traction with regulators.\n\nThe Microsoft-Activision deal may have been defeated, but there will likely be more deals like it in the future. As long as Lina Khan remains a steadfast advocate for regulatory reform, the future of Big Tech deals appears brighter.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nLaw enforcement officials in Brazil will likely reinstate fraud charges against US Rep.-elect George Santos as the New York Republican officially assumes his role in the US House Tuesday under a cloud of suspicion over his dubious resume, the New York Times reported Monday.\n\nAccording to the Times, prosecutors said they will seek a \u201cformal response\u201d from Santos related to a stolen checkbook in 2008, after police suspended an investigation into him after they were unable to find him for nearly a decade.\n\nAuthorities, having verified Santos\u2019 location, will make a formal request to the Justice Department to notify him of the charges, Nathaly Ducoulombier, a spokeswoman for the Rio de Janeiro prosecutor\u2019s office, told the Times.\n\nCNN has reached out to a lawyer for Santos for comment.\n\nThe criminal case, according to the Times, citing court records it has reviewed, stems from a visit Santos made to a small clothing store in Niter\u00f3i, a city outside of Rio de Janeiro, where Santos spent nearly $700 out of the stolen checkbook using a fake name.\n\nCNN previously confirmed reporting from the Times last month that Santos was charged with embezzlement in a Brazilian court in 2011, according to case records from the Rio de Janeiro Court of Justice. However, court records from 2013 state that the charge was archived after court summons went unanswered and they were unable to locate Santos.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Post last week, Santos denied that he had been charged with any crime in Brazil, saying: \u201cI am not a criminal here \u2013 not here or in Brazil or any jurisdiction in the world. Absolutely not. That didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nSantos flipped a Democratic-held seat, helping Republicans win a narrow House majority. And he is set to take office on Tuesday.\n\nThe New York Republican has admitted to lying about parts of his resume after The New York Times first revealed on December 19 that Santos\u2019 biography appeared to be partly fictional.\n\nCNN confirmed details of that reporting about his college education and employment history and uncovered even more falsehoods from Santos, including claims he was forced to leave a New York City private school when his family\u2019s real estate assets took a downturn and that he represented Goldman Sachs at a top financial conference.\n\nSantos\u2019 claims that his grandparents fled the Holocaust as Ukrainian Jewish refugees and that his mother died as a result of being present in the South Tower during 9/11 have also come under scrutiny, CNN\u2019s KFile found.\n\nIn interviews with WABC radio and the New York Post on December 26, Santos admitted to lying about attending Baruch College and New York University as well as misrepresenting his employment at Goldman Sachs and Citigroup but said at the time he still intended to serve in Congress.\n\nTwo days later, CNN reported that the US attorney\u2019s office in the Eastern District of New York had begun investigating the finances of Santos, who faces questions over his wealth and loans totaling more than $700,000 he made to his successful 2022 campaign.\n\nThe same day, the Nassau County district attorney\u2019s office announced it was also looking into fabrications from Santos.\n\n\u201cNo one is above the law and if a crime was committed in this county, we will prosecute it,\u201d Nassau County District Attorney Anne Donnelly said at the time.\n\nThe district attorney\u2019s office did not specify what fabrications it was exploring and the US attorney\u2019s office in the Eastern District of New York declined to comment.\n\nCNN has reached out to a representative for Santos for comment on the probes.\n\nSantos\u2019 FEC reports contain a number of unusual expenditures, including exorbitant expenses on air travel and hotels, as well as a number of expenses one penny below the dollar figure above which the FEC requires campaigns to keep receipts.\n\n\u201cCampaign expenditures for staff members including travel, lodging, and meals are normal expenses of any competent campaign. The suggestion that the Santos campaign engaged in any unlawful spending of campaign funds is irresponsible, at best,\u201d Joe Murray, a lawyer for Santos, said in a statement to CNN on Saturday.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Here is the rewritten text:\n\nA comprehensive overview of mortgage borrowing limits in Louisiana by county for the year 2023 has been published, providing essential information to the public.\n\nThe newly released limits, set by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), have experienced a significant increase compared to the previous year. The most notable rise in mortgage limits is observed in Orleans Parish, where the limit has increased from $ 585,000 in 2022 to $ 750,000 in 2023.\n\nIn addition to the substantial increase in Orleans Parish, other Louisiana parishes have also seen significant rises, including Jefferson Parish ($ 585,000 to $ 678,000), St. Bernard Parish ($ 585,000 to $ 678,000), and East Baton Rouge Parish ($ 585,000 to $ 678,000).\n\nWhile a majority of parishes have experienced increases, some have seen decreases in their limits. Tangipahoa Parish, for instance, has seen the largest decrease, from $ 585,000 in 2022 to $ 487,500 in 2023.\n\nStatewide, the median home prices have risen by 8.5 percent from 2022 to 2023, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR). This increase in home prices is in line with the nationwide trend of a 6.7 percent rise in the median price of homes.\n\nThe mortgage limits for Louisiana for the year 2023 were published on December 31st, 2020. The limits are established annually by the FHFA, based on the median home price in each parish. The limits are recalculated each year based on changes in median home prices in each parish.\n\nLouisiana's mortgage limits are higher than the national average and more in line with those seen in other high-cost areas of the country. For instance, the mortgage limit for Orleans Parish is higher than the limit for Los Angeles County, California, where the limit is $ 730,000.\n\nThe FHFA also sets annual mortgage limits for the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP). The mortgage limits for Louisiana for 2023 under HARP are $ 603,000.\n\nThe new mortgage limits will provide homeowners in Louisiana with more options to purchase a home or refinance an existing mortgage. The higher limits may also encourage more people to become homeowners in the state, leading to a boost in the housing market in Louisiana.\n\nLouisiana is already experiencing a positive trend in the housing market, with sales up 4.4 percent from the previous year. The housing market in the state is expected to continue to improve throughout 2023.\n\nThe FHFA sets the mortgage limits annually and publishes the information on its website. Homeowners can also check with their mortgage lender to find out the limits for their particular county or parish.\n\nLouisiana's mortgage limits for 2023 are the highest they've been in recent years and should provide potential home buyers with more options when it comes to finding a home. With the higher limits, it's possible that more people will enter the housing market, which could lead to increased home sales and a continued improvement in the housing market in the state.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "\"I got a few episodes [into Bad Sisters ] during a plane ride and am parceling the rest out like little treats so it lasts longer.\"\n\nThis is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.\n\nGood morning, and welcome back to The Daily\u2019s Sunday culture edition, in which one Atlantic writer reveals what\u2019s keeping them entertained.\n\nToday\u2019s special guest is Kate Lindsay, who has written viral Atlantic articles about the Instagram \u201cick\u201d and the \u201cMillennial pause.\u201d (Translation: Instagram is over, and Millennials are aging out of the internet, respectively.) She also talked about the Millennial pause in a viral TikTok and writes a newsletter, Embedded, about internet culture. Kate is savoring The Thursday Murder Club and fighting with her friends about The 1975, and she would follow Sabrina the Teenage Witch anywhere, even Paramount Plus.\n\nBut first, here are three Sunday reads from The Atlantic.\n\nThe Culture Survey: Kate Lindsay\n\nThe upcoming event I\u2019m most looking forward to: My friends and I need to get tickets to see Jodie Comer in the play Prima Facie when it comes to New York City this April. Comer is obviously best known for playing opposite Sandra Oh on Killing Eve, but real heads know her from My Mad Fat Diary. It was her monologue in Snatches that first made me need to see her live. [Related: Killing Eve and the riddle of why women kill]\n\nThe television show I\u2019m most enjoying right now: I have an annoying tendency to get something recommended to me over and over and, when I finally make my way to it, be like, \u201cWhy did no one tell me about this earlier???\u201d Sharon Horgan\u2019s Bad Sisters is one of those things. Based on the Belgian series Clan, this Apple TV+ show is about five sisters, four of whom (maybe) conspired to kill the fifth\u2019s terrible husband. I don\u2019t know yet! I got a few episodes deep during a plane ride and am parceling the rest out like little treats so it lasts longer. As will shortly become apparent, I\u2019m a sucker for a mystery based in the U.K. or Ireland. [Related: The wrath of a woman without any options]\n\nBest novel I\u2019ve recently read: The Thursday Murder Club is the first book in a U.K.-based mystery series of the same name by Richard Osman. I can promise you that no other book about murder will make you feel this warm and fuzzy. Set in a retirement community near Kent, the series follows a group of senior citizens who meet weekly in an attempt to crack unsolved cases, often running into a few present-day mysteries of their own. The characters are loveable, the writing quick and hilarious, and the plot genuinely gripping. And there\u2019s good news for those of you hearing about The Thursday Murder Club for the first time: It\u2019s already three books deep.\n\nAn author I will read anything by: Tana French, who, if you can believe this, writes Ireland-based mystery novels. Six belong to the incredible Dublin Murder Squad series, and her two additional stand-alone novels\u2014The Witch Elm and The Searcher\u2014are just as good. I read all eight in the summer of 2021 and have been waiting patiently for any scrap of news about her next book ever since. In fact, two of my friends have emailed French herself to see if she is working on anything new. I\u2019ll let you know if we ever hear back. [Related: Women are writing the best crime novels.]\n\nMy go-to karaoke song: I\u2019m a recovering a cappella group member, and karaoke is my shameless two minutes in the spotlight. Do not sing along with me; I am performing. And in most cases, it\u2019s Tom Petty\u2019s \u201cFree Fallin\u2019,\u201d because it\u2019s a crowd-pleaser and, most important, comfortably within my vocal range.\n\n\"[Shari Elf\u2019s World Famous Crochet Museum] is small, but the collection is significant.\" (Courtesy of Kate Lindsay)\n\nThe last museum show that I loved: Try as I might, I\u2019m not a huge museum person, but as a knitter, I had to stop by Shari Elf\u2019s World Famous Crochet Museum when I was in Joshua Tree over New Year\u2019s. The space is small, but the collection is significant. [Related: Getting through a pandemic with old-fashioned crafts]\n\nSomething I recently rewatched: I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s ever a time I\u2019m not actively revisiting the late-\u201990s/early-\u201900s sitcom Sabrina the Teenage Witch. I used to come home from school every day to watch it, and it\u2019s the first thing I put on as an adult whenever I need some comfort. The series will have just left Hulu (my most recent binge was in anticipation of this). But I\u2019ll follow that kooky witch, played by Melissa Joan Hart, and her talking cat, voiced by Nick Bakay, anywhere\u2014even Paramount Plus. [Related: How Chilling Adventures of Sabrina thinks about female power]\n\nOnline creators that I\u2019m a fan of: YouTube and TikTok are my primary forms of entertainment, and I\u2019ve followed so many creators for so long that this is a hard answer to narrow down. But now that content creators are somewhat mainstream, I\u2019ll recommend the YouTuber Rachel Nguyen as one who is doing something totally different and refreshing. We recently had a great conversation about creating authentic art in an algorithm-driven world, and her quarantine vlog is proof that online content can be just that: art.\n\nThe last debate I had about culture: Thanks to TikTok, I recently became obsessed with The 1975, and no one in my life is being supportive. I\u2019ve been listening to their new album, Being Funny in a Foreign Language, pretty much nonstop for the past two months, but every time I try to play it among friends\u2014in cars or at dinner parties\u2014I\u2019m soundly overruled. These people insist the music is bad, which is incorrect. It was a tense Friendsgiving.\n\nA poem, or line of poetry, that I return to: I had completely forgotten about this poem until my friend Jehan resurfaced it when we were talking about how much we love the actor Aya Cash. Cash\u2019s mom is the poet Kim Addonizio, who wrote \u201cTo the Woman Crying Uncontrollably in the Next Stall\u201d:\n\n\u201clisten I love you joy is coming\u201d\n\nRead past editions of the Culture Survey with Xochitl Gonzalez, Spencer Kornhaber, Jenisha Watts, David French, Shirley Li, David Sims, Lenika Cruz, Jordan Calhoun, Hannah Giorgis, and Sophie Gilbert.\n\nThe Week Ahead\n\nHouse Party, a comedy directed by Calmatic and produced by Maverick Carter and LeBron James, who also stars as himself (in theaters Friday) Plane, a thriller starring Gerard Butler and Mike Colter (in theaters Friday) Still Pictures: On Photography and Memory, Janet Malcolm\u2019s posthumous memoir (Tuesday)\n\nEssay\n\n(Joanne Imperio / The Atlantic; Claudia Raschke / Sony Pictures Classics; Martha Kaplan / Sony Pictures Classics; Thomas Victor / Sony Pictures Classics)\n\nA Civil War Over Semicolons\n\nBy Gal Beckerman\n\nThe partnership of Robert Caro and Robert Gottlieb is beautifully anachronistic. As writer and editor, respectively, they have together produced 4,888 pages over the course of 50 years, including the multivolume, still unfinished saga that is Caro\u2019s biography of Lyndon B. Johnson. A lasting collaboration of this sort is impossible to imagine in today\u2019s publishing world of constant churn. Then there\u2019s their method: Caro puts on a dark suit every day, writes his drafts out in longhand, and copies them onto carbon paper using his Smith Corona typewriter, after which Gottlieb marks them up with a pencil\u2014like a couple of cobblers still making shoes with an awl. Whatever deal Caro got from Gottlieb and Knopf in the 1970s, it has allowed him to work monastically on this biography project seemingly without any other source of income. As Caro\u2019s longtime agent, Lynn Nesbit, says of the arrangement in Turn Every Page, a new documentary about Caro and Gottlieb, \u201cI doubt that it could ever happen again.\u201d But there\u2019s something else about the relationship that gives a glimpse into another era: The two don\u2019t seem to like each other all that much. They bicker all the time, about every comma, period, and semicolon. Actually, don\u2019t even get them started on semicolons.\n\nRead the full article.\n\nMore in Culture\n\nCatch Up on The Atlantic\n\nPhoto Album\n\n(Patrick Hertzog / AFP / Getty)\n\nCheck out snapshots from a photographer\u2019s visit to the French Southern and Antarctic Lands, home of many penguins, seals, and seabirds.\n\nIsabel Fattal contributed to this newsletter.\n\nExplore all of our newsletters.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "A novel phenomenon has emerged in the tech industry, where high-level employees from prominent companies like Google are leaving their lucrative jobs to focus on climate change activism full-time. This trend began in October with a group of Google engineers publishing a Medium post stating their intention to use their skills for good.\n\nSince then, around 20 Google employees have made the switch, followed by employees from Amazon, Microsoft, and other tech giants. Many of these tech workers had enviable jobs at successful companies, but they chose to give them up to tackle a pressing issue that is far from being resolved.\n\nSo, why are they making this drastic change? For some, it's a passion for the cause and a sense of responsibility to make a difference. Others believe corporations must be held accountable for their environmental impact and want to be part of that effort.\n\nAdditionally, many of these tech workers feel a sense of guilt for their role in the climate crisis, as technology has contributed to increased emissions. One Google engineer explained, \"I felt a sense of responsibility and guilt for what my job was contributing to in terms of climate change and global warming, so I wanted to use my skills to try and do something about it.\"\n\nInterestingly, not all of these tech workers have severed ties with their former employers entirely. Many continue to work with them through consulting or part-time engagements, allowing them to utilize their skills while still contributing to the fight against climate change.\n\nSelf-preservation also plays a role in this trend, as these tech workers are aware that climate change is already affecting the world and that they may face an uncertain future if they don't take action. As one engineer noted, \"Climate change is real, and it's happening faster than many of us thought possible. We're already seeing the impacts of rising temperatures and severe weather. It's only going to get worse, so I wanted to do something about it.\"\n\nUltimately, this trend sends a powerful message to tech companies: they must take the climate crisis seriously and address the environmental issues their products and services create to attract and retain top talent. These tech workers are also sending a strong message to the rest of us: it's time to take action. With each person dedicating their career to climate activism, we move closer to a future where we can address this crisis head-on and create a better, more sustainable world.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "The Crimson Tide's quarterback, Bryce Young, is pondering his future after a disappointing performance in the Sugar Bowl. Despite leading Alabama to an 11-0 regular season record and an SEC Championship in his redshirt sophomore year, Young's decision to return for his junior year, declare for the NFL Draft, or transfer to another school is still uncertain.\n\nSources close to Young indicate that he is weighing his options and has not yet made a decision. Young has been heavily recruited by both the NFL and college teams, with some projecting him as a first or second round pick in the 2021 NFL Draft.\n\nHowever, Young's loyalty to the Alabama program, particularly coach Nick Saban, may play a significant role in his decision.

{"text": "Residents of a quaint New England town are seeking assistance from trained professionals to address a growing concern regarding the presence of certain canines.\n\nThe town of Cumberland, situated near Providence, the state capital, has witnessed a significant surge in the number of coyotes spotted in the area over the past few months. Initially, these coyotes have primarily scavenged for food and caused minimal disruptions. However, in recent weeks, their behavior has become more concerning, with sightings during the day and reports of them approaching homes and entering backyards.\n\nGiven the rapid growth of the coyote population, local authorities have become increasingly concerned about the safety of the community. The police department has already implemented measures to capture the coyotes using live traps. Although these efforts have been moderately successful, the local government is now considering more comprehensive solutions.\n\nThe town council recently held a meeting to discuss the issue and voted to bring in trained professionals to address the problem. A local company has been hired to employ marksmen who will safely hunt the coyotes from a distance, taking care to avoid harming other wildlife. The goal is to reduce the coyote population to a level that no longer poses a threat to the community.\n\nThe duration and success of this process are uncertain, but many residents are relieved that action is being taken. The arrival of the sharpshooters also serves as a reminder to residents to remain vigilant, as coyotes can be dangerous. It is essential to take steps to protect pets and children, secure trash cans, and remove potential food sources that might attract the animals.\n\nUltimately, the involvement of the sharpshooters may be the most effective way to address the coyote issue in Cumberland. While it may seem drastic, it is a necessary step to ensure the safety of the community. It is hoped that the coyote population will soon return to an acceptable level.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Written by Leah Dolan, CNN Contributors Hanna Pham, CNN\n\nIf you've reached the end of the year feeling as though you didn't read enough, we've got you. Here are some of the best books of the year according to notable authors, artists, image-makers and other cultural tastemakers.\n\nEmily Ratajkowski, model: 'Ghost Lover'\n\nBloomsbury Publishing\n\n\"This collection of nine short stories wrestles with many of the same themes in Lisa Taddeo's beloved 'Three Women,' but in a sharper, nastier way. She ruthlessly explores jealousy, relationships between women, aging, revenge and, of course, desire. Taddeo never lets you come up for air \u2014 making you laugh while simultaneously horrifying you all when you least expect it.\"\n\nOttessa Moshfegh, novelist: 'A Ballet of Lepers'\n\nGrove Press\n\n\"Leonard Cohen has always been one of my creative heroes. I discovered his music when I was a teenager in the 90s, and his deep, gravelly voice, for me, still exemplifies the wisdom and soulfulness that an artist earns after decades of work, a voice so true that it almost feels like an artifact, something carved from stone, immense and permanent. So it was a complete surprise to read fiction that he had written as a very young man, before any of the music I know so well. In 'A Ballet of Lepers,' you get a novel and a collection of short stories Cohen composed between 1956 and 1961. Even in his twenties, he was exploring the themes we know as quintessentially Cohen: romantic love, depression, loss, sexuality, grace. The writing captures all the gorgeous poeticism that we have come to love about his music, as well as a youthful naivete and a playfulness, a rawness that I wouldn't have predicted. There's something so fun in seeing where this all began.\"\n\nJennette McCurdy, author and actor: 'What My Bones Know'\n\nBallantine Books\n\n\"'What My Bones Know' is a striking memoir. Stephanie Foo's voice is singular \u2014 at times poetic, at times biting. A must-read for anyone healing from complex trauma.\"\n\nTheaster Gates, artist: 'To the Realization of Perfect Helplessness'\n\nKnopf\n\n\"Robin Coste Lewis has created a photographic and linguistic archive that draws from the pre-diasporic truth of family \u2014 family before Blackness and before the permutations of misunderstandings by others about 'us.' Her poems never stop offering me ways to more deeply understand the complex ways of being migratory, beautiful and optimistic in times of gross inequity. Lewis creates light and portals that reveal our truth through words and the images underneath our grandmother's bed.\"\n\nHans Ulrich Obrist, curator and artistic director of the Serpentine Galleries: 'I Always Knew'\n\nPrinceton University Press\n\n\"This is a portrait of artist and writer Barbara Chase-Riboud, through the letters she wrote to her mother, Vivian Mae, between 1957 and 1991. In this remarkable title, Barbara Chase-Riboud tells her mother about her development as an artist, her love stories, and her trips around the globe, from Africa to China. In these memoirs, Chase-Riboud candidly and passionately describes her aspirations, her ambitions and creative inspiration, while also showcasing love and tenderness to her mother. Chase-Riboud is a pioneer and her multi-faceted practice explores the timely themes of identity, power and memory. A sculptor, novelist and poet, her career spans more than seven decades and over this time she has been a great inspiration to other artists around the world too. Aligned with Serpentine's goal of spotlighting groundbreaking innovators whose work deserves greater attention, we couldn't be prouder to present the first UK exhibition by Chase-Riboud.\"\n\nDouglas Stewart, novelist: 'Trespasses'\n\nRiverhead Books\n\n\"I absolutely loved 'Trespasses' by Louise Kennedy. Set during the troubles in Northern Ireland, it is the story of Cushla, a young Catholic school teacher who falls for a charismatic older man. Cushla is caught between caring for her alcoholic mother, teaching at the local parochial school and helping run the family pub. She feels stifled until she meets Michael, and her world begins to slowly expand. But not only is Michael married, he is also a prominent Protestant, a Barrister known for defending IRA members.\n\n'Trespasses' is a rare book. By making the political so personal it gives an intimate perspective to life during the Troubles. Cushla's world is so acutely rendered, her inner life so vivid, that as she finds a new freedom with Michael you will genuinely worry for her. You can feel the mounting pressure as Cushla commits various acts of transgression, crossing lines of faith, class and geographical borders. It's impossible not to be gripped by her story.\"\n\nNadia Lee Cohen, photographer and artist: 'Best Seller'\n\nIDEA Books Ltd\n\n'Best Seller' is a meta-fiction novel. It begins 'If I wrote a book it would be a bestseller, and that is what I will call it... BEST SELLER.' I was first drawn to the book after I was invited to create the portrait of the 'author,' June Newton. Plus it's bright pink. The book made me feel like I was June Newton, and I think others should read it so they can feel like her too.\"\n\nMax Richter, composer: 'Sound Within Sound'\n\nFaber\n\n\"I loved this alternative history of 20th century music, Molleson's insightful chronicle of some of the maverick figures who spent their lives expanding the limits of musical languages across the last hundred years or so. Along the way we discover many gems the Canonical version of music history has forgotten about, or simply ignored. What makes the book really special is that it powerfully conveys the passion that drives these people to do what they do; the questions they wrestle with, the trade-offs they make in order to get the work done, the costs \u2014 to themselves and to those around them \u2014 of placing a singular creative pursuit at the center of their lives. 'As artists, our business is curiosity,' said John Cage; Molleson's book gives us a wonderful opportunity to witness that curiosity in action, and so to hear the world anew.\"\n\nAvan Jogia, actor: 'Who is Wellness For?'\n\nHarper Wave\n\n\"'Who is Wellness For?' is a book that works as part social observation and part memoir. It explores the commodification of healing and ritual and asks questions about the industry of wellness. I found the read insightful, thoughtful and unafraid. Wellness isn't for anyone if it's not for everyone\"\n\nSimone Rocha, fashion designer: 'The Pachinko Parlor'\n\nDaunt\n\n\"I enjoyed this book for a few reasons and reading it felt like a pause. It's a story which captures being alien in a place that should feel like home. It's visceral, struggling with one's own identity. There's a lightness and a coldness and a disconnect, which is inviting. A slight sorrow, but a beautiful narration on a time of feeling displaced and out of place, almost in the way.\"\n\nFaye Toogood, furniture designer: 'I am Sparkling'\n\nDamiani\n\n\"I have many books on photography in my library and it's always truly exciting to discover little known artists through new books. This book focuses on the work of N. V. Parekh, an Indian Kenyan photographer working out of Mombasa in the forties through to the seventies. Found in his archive, this series of insightful portraits depict an ethnically diverse cross-section of Mombasa's bourgeoisie \u2014 an urban, largely affluent class that had benefited from the city's postwar prosperity and who took an interest in documenting their own lives.\n\nThe book reminded me of a trip I made to Mali twenty years ago when I was working for The World of Interiors magazine. I visited Malike Sidibe's studio and bought a print from a box of prints being sold by his son.

The novel tells the story of a Catalan mountain valley during the Spanish Civil war from a series of rotating perspectives \u2014 a widow, a poet, thundering clouds, chanterelle mushrooms, a dog watching his owner make love for the first time in years. There is beauty and heartbreak and an attention to the things that surround us that so often are forgotten that it dares you to walk around and notice them yourself.

The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also fell 0.7%.\n\nThe moves early Tuesday come after broad-based declines on Friday in a fitting end to Wall Street\u2019s worst year since the Global Financial Crisis in 2008. U.S. stock and bond markets were closed on Monday in observance of New Year\u2019s Day.\n\nThe S&P 500 tumbled 19.4% in 2022, while the Nasdaq Composite wiped out one-third of its value, dropping 33% and closing out its first four-quarter decline since the 2000 dot-com bubble.

{"text": "Minneapolis CNN \u2014\n\nFriday\u2019s jobs report is expected to show that the US economy added 200,000 jobs in December, with the unemployment rate holding steady for the third-straight month at 3.7%.\n\nThe Labor Department\u2019s final monthly employment tally for 2022 likely brings with it some familiar storylines.\n\n\u2014 Job growth is expected to remain robust, although slower than the breakneck pace of historically high job gains during the early stages of economic recovery from the pandemic.\n\n\u2014 Workers are still not returning to hard-hit sectors such as leisure and hospitality, public service and child care.\n\n\u2014 The strong labor market, while it keeps the economy churning, is a little too consistently vigorous for the Federal Reserve\u2019s needs to reduce inflation by tempering demand.\n\n\u2014 The tight labor market needs more workers, and wage growth still hasn\u2019t returned to pre-pandemic levels, which would help quell fears of a wage-price spiral, when higher wages cause price increases that in turn cause higher wages.\n\nLather, rinse and repeat.\n\n\u201cThe preponderance of evidence suggests that the labor market is still nowhere near back to normal,\u201d said Julia Pollak, senior economist with ZipRecruiter online employment marketplace.\n\nHistorically tight\n\nThe US labor market remains atypically tight \u2014 something that was reinforced Wednesday when the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report for November. It showed there were still north of 10.5 million job openings, or about 1.7 available positions for every unemployed person looking for work.\n\nThe survey also showed that what has been deemed the \u201cGreat Resignation\u201d is still chugging along, Pollak said. During the Covid-19 pandemic, a record number of workers voluntarily quit their jobs in search of greener pastures \u2014 be it better working conditions, higher pay, or increased flexibility.\n\nThe number of people per month quitting their jobs has now landed above 4 million for 18 months straight. In the two decades leading up to the pandemic, the monthly average was 2.6 million.\n\nA \"Now Hiring\" sign is displayed on a storefront in Adams Morgan Neighborhood on October 07, 2022, in Washington, DC. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\n\u201cCompanies are still battling huge retention difficulties,\u201d Pollak said.\n\nThe latest JOLTS didn\u2019t show that the market was loosening up as maybe some had hoped or expected. But it did provide a window into some of the divergence that\u2019s occurring at a time when some businesses are hiring more to meet consumer demand while others scale down their operations because of bloat, the rippling effects of high interest rates, or preparation for less fruitful economic times ahead.\n\nIndustries such as accommodation and food services reported about 50% fewer layoffs in November than what was seen on average between 2000 and February 2020, Pollak said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s mostly just pre-pandemic recovery,\u201d she said. \u201cLeisure and hospitality is still short hundreds of thousands of workers and just still ramping up, because spending recovered more quickly than staffing.\u201d\n\nAs of October 2022, the leisure and hospitality sector was still below pre-pandemic employment levels by more than 1 million jobs, or 6.3%, according to a CNN Business analysis of BLS employment data.\n\nCuts and freezes\n\nTechnology companies have accounted for the lion\u2019s share of job cuts announced in recent months. During the pandemic, when people were relegated to working and spending their money from home, tech and e-commerce firms bulked up to meet the demand.\n\nDuring 2022, technology was the leading job-cutting industry, with 97,171 reductions announced, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas\u2019 latest job cut announcement report released Thursday.\n\nOverall, job cuts trended upward in 2022 at 363,824 as compared to 321,970 the year before. There were 43,651 job cuts announced in December, a 129% jump from December 2021, according to the report.\n\nBut the job cuts announced in 2022 were the second-lowest on record, going back to 1993, Challenger, Gray & Christmas data showed. In 2019, there were 592,556 job cuts announced.\n\n\u201cThe overall economy is still creating jobs, though employers appear to be actively planning for a downturn,\u201d Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in the report.\n\nSecond-best year on record for job growth\n\nIf the monthly job gains come in as expected on Friday, that would mean the economy added more than 4.5 million jobs in 2022.\n\nThat would be the second-highest annual total on record, behind the massive 6.7 million gains in 2021, which of itself was a pendulum swing from a record 9.2 million job losses in 2020, BLS data shows.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Reserve would like to see a [monthly job growth] number closer to 100,000 or below that,\u201d said Nick Bunker, economic research director for North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab. \u201cThat\u2019s more in line with a clearly cooling labor market.\u201d\n\nDrivers wait in traffic during the morning rush hour commute in Los Angeles, California on February 23, 2022 Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEconomists are also expecting average hourly earnings growth to slow on a monthly and year-over-year basis, to 0.4% and 5%, respectively, according to Refinitiv.\n\nWage gains, although outpaced by inflation, remain well above pre-pandemic averages and beyond what the Fed wants to see in its price-busting campaign. Chair Jerome Powell, while acknowledging that the wage increases did not cause inflation to spike to the highest levels in 40 years, has repeatedly noted that persistent wage growth in such a tight labor market could keep inflation levels elevated.\n\n\u201cThis is a set of labor market data that for workers and job seekers, [continued, strong nominal wage growth] it\u2019s very much positive news,\u201d Bunker said. \u201cBut for central bankers, they see this as a problem.\u201d\n\nInflation has started to come down in recent months, with key gauges showing declines. But for the Fed to reach its desired target of 2% inflation, the labor market will have to take a hit, with unemployment rising to about 4.6% this year, according to the central bank\u2019s projections released in December.\n\n\u201cThe fact that inflation appears to be cooling down without the labor market taking a significant hit is a sign that a lot of this very high inflation was not driven by the labor market and that it is possible for inflation to be coming down from these levels without the labor market taking a hit,\u201d Bunker said.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s unclear how far inflation can fall without the labor market deteriorating, or rather, it\u2019s not clear what the underlying pace of inflation is with the labor market this tight.\u201d\n\n\u2014CNN\u2019s Matt Egan contributed to this report.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The film is tied with Warner Bros.' \"The Batman,\" which also generated $134 million during its domestic opening in March, as the fifth-highest opening of the year, according to data from Comscore.\n\nThe film snared $134 million at the domestic box office during its opening weekend, short of the $175 million that industry analysts had predicted, and just under the $135 million to $150 million range that Disney had forecast.\n\nJames Cameron's \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" fell short of lofty box office expectations, but international ticket sales spark hope that the long-awaited sequel could still pull in a substantial global haul.\n\n\"Because most people are loving the film, the sugar high of that enthusiasm inspired some opening weekend predictions that the historical data and various headwinds for the film don't support,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. \"That said, 'The Way Of Water' has many factors working in its favor that ensure its long-term prospects for massive global success.\"\n\nNotably, China accounted for $57.1 million in ticket sales for the three-day opening weekend.\n\nThe Chinese box office contributed around $265 million to \"Avatar's\" global tally a decade ago, but the market has grown significantly since. Prior to the pandemic, China was the second-highest-grossing theatrical market in the world. Since cinemas reopened in the country, it has been one of the fastest markets to recover and generate box office success.\n\nIn 2009, China's overall box office reached $910 million. A decade later, it topped $8 billion.\n\nBox office analysts aren't concerned with the movie's smaller-than-expected domestic box office, particularly because of how it has played internationally. The original \"Avatar,\" which was released in 2009, only made $77 million during its opening weekend, but went on to become the highest-grossing film of all time. It maintains that title thanks to several rereleases.\n\nThe first film had incredible staying power at the box office, running in theaters through August 2010, a staggering 234 days. \"Avatar\" ultimately generated $760 million in the U.S. and Canada and more than $2 billion from international markets during its initial theatrical run.\n\n\"Although the film is opening on the low end of expectations, it's important to again emphasize the long-term outlook,\" said Shawn Robbins, chief media analyst at BoxOffice.com. \"Audiences are showing a strong preference to see the film in premium formats, factoring into the volatility noted in pre-release forecasts.\"\n\nRobbins noted that the upcoming holiday corridor and a lack of competition in the market positions \"The Way of Water\" for a more back-loaded box office than a typical blockbuster.\n\nPremium formats, which include IMAX, Dolby Cinema and Motion auditoriums accounted for 62% of all tickets sold. A whopping 57% of that total was for 3D tickets. Premium format tickets are more expensive than traditional tickets.\n\n\"The Way of Water\" 3D tickets averaged $16.55 each while 2D cost $12.62 a piece, according to data from EntTelligence.\n\n\"It's premature to qualify the film's degree of success at this stage, especially with Cameron's history of long runs at the global box office,\" Robbins added.", "label": "human"}

But antitrust experts say the FTC faces an uphill battle to convince a judge to block the deal, because of the voluntary concessions offered by Microsoft to allay fears it could dominate the gaming market.\n\nMichael Chappell, the FTC administrative law judge, will rule on the deal after hearings set for August 2023. Either side can then appeal to the same FTC commissioners who voted to bring the challenge, and then to a U.S. appeals court.\n\nThe deal faces scrutiny in the European Union which is to decide by March 23 whether to clear or block the deal.\n\nReporting by Diane Bartz in Washington Editing by Matthew Lewis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "For many individuals, inquiring about another person's ancestral origin is not only inquisitive but necessary. Nevertheless, it's apparent that the act of inquiring about someone's \"ancestral roots\" can be uncomfortable and, as many have pointed out, even discriminatory. But what do people with a mixed ancestry \u2013 or members of minority groups \u2013 genuinely think when they're asked such a query?\n\nMany people from diverse backgrounds (POD) have shared in recent years how culturally insensitive comments can be hurtful. The intention might not be to offend, but people of all backgrounds may not always recognize the implications or impact of words or gestures. In the era of inclusivity and diversity, it's crucial to consider how certain language and inquiries affect different communities.\n\nTo gain a deeper understanding of how POD, especially those from mixed ancestry, feel when they're asked \"What are your roots?\", we asked several individuals to share their thoughts on the matter.\n\nGail Christopher, the founder of Ntide, an intergenerational equity nonprofit, said this type of inquiry is particularly challenging for individuals whose ancestry is not clearly defined.\n\n\"Those of us who are of mixed heritage often struggle with this question,\" said Christopher, who is also the former executive vice president of the W.K. Kellogg Foundation. \"Often, we don't feel like we have a clear answer, since we are a complex blend of heritages and cultures. We are left feeling like we're not fully seen and accepted for who we are.\"\n\nFor many, these types of inquiries further complicate their individual identity, especially for those who are already struggling to make sense of their own ancestry or heritage.\n\n\"When we're asked, 'What are your roots?', we often feel like we're being reduced to a single ancestral group and our heritage and culture is ignored,\" Christopher added.\n\nCatherine Ceniza Choy, a professor of ethnic studies at the University of California, Berkeley, said in an email that when multiracial people are asked to define their identity, it \"can be a psychologically fraught experience\" since it implies they can't properly define themselves.\n\n\"The implication is that they need to be 'labeled' or sorted by others,\" she said.\n\nWhen it comes to ancestry, we often think of identities in binary terms \u2013 one is either white, black, Hispanic, Asian, Native American or Pacific Islander, for example \u2013 but in reality, identity is more complicated than that. It can't always be explained by a single box on a government form.\n\n\"It's important to remember that a large percentage of the population is mixed-race and multiracial,\" Choy said. \"And many mixed-race people experience the difficulty of needing to negotiate two or more ancestral heritages and cultures in one body.\"\n\nThat difficulty, she added, is compounded when they're asked to choose one ancestry over another, as is often the case when filling out an application or other forms.\n\n\"We need to acknowledge the dynamic hybridity of ancestry and ancestral identity that many experience,\" Choy said. \"Ancestral identities are fluid and can change over time.\"\n\nAngel Chudabala, an actor from Los Angeles, said he was hesitant to talk about his mixed-race identity for many years. His mother is Latina and his father is Thai, yet he struggled to answer questions about his \"true\" identity.\n\n\"The first time I had to check a box for my ancestral identity, I froze and didn't know what to do,\" Chudabala said.\n\nThese experiences can lead to lasting feelings of confusion and alienation. Chudabala recalled an instance in which he felt singled out at a restaurant by another customer.\n\n\"I remember once, I was out to dinner with my mom and I got asked by another diner, 'What are your roots?' in an aggressive way,\" he said. \"It was disarming because I felt like I had to answer the question and the other person had a right to know.\"\n\nChudabala's story isn't uncommon. In fact, it's becoming increasingly more common as the U.S. population becomes more racially and ethnically diverse. And given the tensions of the last few years, it's understandable why people of color may feel uncomfortable being asked about their heritage.\n\nIt's important to recognize, however, that a simple question can have a lasting impact on a person's sense of identity and even security.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "A forthcoming period of heightened tension is anticipated for Tesla Inc. as it navigates a pivotal market.\n\nTesla's CEO, Elon Musk, has consistently emphasized the significance of the Chinese market for the electric-car manufacturer's future. The company is preparing to make China its largest market outside of the US.\n\nHowever, analysts caution that Tesla is poised to enter a prolonged \"pain period\" as it confronts a multitude of challenges in the Chinese market. These challenges include intensifying competition from local players, high production costs, and the need to resolve its long-standing dispute with the Chinese government over tariffs and subsidies.\n\nTo put things in perspective, China accounts for more than a third of Tesla's total global sales and has been its largest market for the past two years. As of 2020, Tesla had sold over 400,000 cars in the country, generating more than $20 billion in revenue.\n\nChina is one of the few markets where Tesla has been able to generate profits, largely due to the country's massive population of affluent car buyers and generous subsidies for electric vehicles.\n\nHowever, the company is now at a crossroads. The Chinese government recently reduced its electric-vehicle subsidies, effectively eliminating one of Tesla's key competitive advantages. The move was seen as a means to support domestic automakers, who are now making inroads into the electric-vehicle market.\n\nAt the same time, Tesla is facing rising production costs in China. It has yet to open its highly anticipated Gigafactory in Shanghai, which analysts say could help reduce production costs. The factory is expected to be completed by the end of this year, but some analysts warn that it could take years before the facility can become fully operational.\n\nFurthermore, the company is embroiled in a long-running trade dispute with the Chinese government. Tesla has been caught in the middle of the trade war between the US and China, and the government has imposed tariffs on a number of its vehicles. The dispute has put pressure on the company's bottom line and has raised questions about its ability to generate profits in the long run.\n\nThese issues have investors concerned, and the company's stock has been volatile in recent weeks. Some analysts have even predicted a bear market for Tesla in the coming months.\n\nOf course, it's impossible to predict the future, but there are a few things that Tesla can do to mitigate the impact of these issues. For starters, the company can continue to focus on its core business and try to outmaneuver its rivals in the Chinese market. This means ramping up production and marketing efforts, as well as expanding its retail footprint in the country.\n\nIn addition, Tesla could look for opportunities to collaborate with the Chinese government and seek more favorable terms for its trade dispute. This could be a challenging proposition, given the contentious nature of the trade war between the two countries, but it may be the only way for the company to secure its long-term future in the Chinese market.\n\nUltimately, the coming months could be critical for Tesla. The company has established itself as a market leader in China, but it now faces a number of issues that could significantly impact its performance in the country. How Tesla responds to these challenges could be key to its success in the long run.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The January 2nd House of Representatives' first floor vote of the new Congress marked a significant setback for House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA). In an effort to address growing internal conflicts, McCarthy proposed a rule change aimed at increasing discipline on the House floor, which would enable the leader to address members who spoke out of turn. However, the proposal was met with fierce resistance from hardline conservatives, ultimately resulting in its rejection.\n\nThis development has exposed the deep divisions within the House GOP, highlighting McCarthy's limited influence over his party. The vote has also underscored the profound ideological chasm that has emerged between moderate Republicans and the hardline conservative wing, which has been intensifying in recent months.\n\nThe proposal's failure has significant implications for McCarthy's leadership, as it has diminished his reputation and authority within the party. The vote has also demonstrated that the House GOP's internal conflicts are far from being resolved, and that the party's future is increasingly uncertain.\n\nThe rejection of McCarthy's proposal has sent a clear message that the party's hardline conservatives will not be silenced, and that they are determined to assert their influence over the party's direction. This development has the potential to further exacerbate the party's divisions, potentially driving moderates away and making it more challenging for the party to regain control of the House.\n\nThe outcome of this vote has left McCarthy's future as leader of the House GOP in doubt, as it has highlighted his tenuous grip on the party. It remains to be seen whether he can recover from this setback and regain control of the caucus, but it is clear that the party's divisions will not be easily resolved.", "label": "machine"}

Evans, who had just four catches on the day, was mobbed by teammates after his touchdown and said afterward, \"That was one of the best catches I've ever made.\"\n\nThe Buccaneers defense also came up big for Brady, as linebacker Lavonte David had a crucial fourth-down stop of Raiders running back Josh Jacobs late in the fourth quarter. Brady said after the game, \"We just found a way to make the plays when we had to, and it was an incredible feeling. We knew that coming into this game we needed to have a great performance to get into the playoffs, and I think we delivered.\"\n\nThe NFL playoffs are now set, and the stage is now set for an exciting postseason. The question now is, can Tom Brady and the Buccaneers make a deep run and make history?", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "New York CNN Business \u2014\n\nNew retirement rules could make it easier for Americans to accumulate retirement savings \u2014 and less costly to withdraw them \u2014 if lawmakers pass a retirement reform package before the end of the month.\n\nThe House already passed its own version of retirement plan rule changes, and two key Senate committees passed their own versions. Since the summer, lawmakers have been trying to stitch the three bills together into one large package known as Secure 2.0.\n\nAfter it\u2019s finalized, one idea is to attach that package to an overall government spending bill that may be voted on by both chambers in Congress before the holidays. But if lawmakers can\u2019t agree on such an omnibus spending bill, Secure 2.0 likely would have to be reintroduced next year for the new Congress\u2019 consideration.\n\n\u201cThe House and Senate have been working to come to an agreement and are close to one \u2014 the final bill is almost there,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin, who co-sponsored the bill passed by the Senate Finance Committee, in an emailed statement. \u201cBut the question is what vehicle will get it across the finish line. We absolutely need to ensure it is a priority.\u201d\n\nWhile the details are still under wraps and no legislative language has been released, here\u2019s a look at seven of the savings provisions very likely to make it into any final retirement package, according to two retirement policy experts who have been following the process closely \u2014 Chris Spence, head of federal government relations at TIAA; and Brigen Winters, a principal and policy practice chair at the law firm Groom Law Group.\n\n1. Require auto enrollment in 401(k) plans\n\nEmployers starting new workplace retirement savings plans could be required to automatically enroll employees in the plan. (It is currently optional for employers to do so.) It would then be up to the employee to actively opt out if they don\u2019t wish to participate.\n\nThe provision would likely require a default contribution rate (e.g., between 3% and 10%) plus automatic escalation (e.g., of 1% per year up to a maximum contribution rate of at least 10% but no more than 15%).\n\n2. Introduce employer contributions for student loan payments\n\nWhen you have to pay down student loan debt, it makes it harder to also save for retirement. Secure 2.0 could let employers make a matching contribution to an employee\u2019s retirement plan based on their student loan payments. That way, it would ensure that the employee is building retirement savings no matter what.\n\n3. Increase the age for required minimum distributions\n\nIt used to be that when you turned 70-1/2 you had to start withdrawing a required minimum amount from your 401(k) or IRA. Then, the age moved up to 72. Under the latest legislation, you likely would not need to tap your retirement savings until age 75 if you did not wish to.\n\n4. Help employees build and access emergency savings\n\nNormally if you tap your 401(k) before age 59-1/2, you must not only pay taxes on that money, but also pay a 10% early-withdrawal penalty.\n\nFor employees who are dissuaded from saving money in a tax-deferred retirement plan because they are concerned it would be too complicated and costly to access it for emergencies, Secure 2.0 may include one or two options to assuage that fear.\n\nOne option would let you make a penalty-free withdrawal of up to $1,000 a year for emergencies. While the employee would still owe income tax on that withdrawal in the year it\u2019s made, they could get that money back if they repay the amount they withdrew within three years, Winters said.\n\nAnother might let an employer add a \u201csidecar account\u201d to an employee\u2019s retirement account, where the employee can contribute after-tax money explicitly for emergencies, Spence said. That money could be taken directly from their paycheck, just as their 401(k) contributions are.\n\n5. Raise catch-up contribution limits for older workers\n\nCurrently, if you\u2019re 50 or older you may contribute an additional $6,500 to your 401(k) on top of the $20,500 annual federal limit. Under the retirement package, those between ages 60 and 64 (the final range may be narrower) may be allowed to contribute $10,000, instead of $6,500.\n\nTo help pay for the cost of the retirement package, however, another provision could require anyone making catch-up contributions to \u201cRothify\u201d them. So, instead of making before-tax contributions up to the catch-up contribution limit, you could still contribute the same amount but it would have to be with after-tax money. That money would then grow tax free and may be withdrawn tax free in retirement. But the federal government would get the tax revenue from the original contribution up front.\n\n6. Enhance and simplify the Saver\u2019s Credit\n\nAn underutilized federal match exists for low-income earners\u2019 retirement contributions up to $2,000 a year. The new retirement package might enhance and simplify the so-called Saver\u2019s Credit so more people could use it. Low-income filers could get a refundable tax credit worth 50% of their savings up to a contribution limit in a given year.\n\nTax credits reduce your tax liability dollar for dollar. But refundable tax credits mean the filer will get the money even if they had no income tax liability to reduce.\n\n7. Make it easier for part-time workers to save\n\nThere will soon be new retirement rules in place that will make it easier for Americans to accumulate retirement savings \u2013 and make it less costly to withdraw them \u2013 now that lawmakers have passed an omnibus spending package, which President Joe Biden is expected to sign next week.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Next year should be a pivotal one for clean energy companies \u2014 and certain stocks are poised to stand out in the crowd, according to JPMorgan. Supply constraints and Covid-related dislocations have made for a difficult 2022 for clean energy names, analyst Bill Peterson said. Those headwinds will abate further into 2023, but companies will also be contending with rising interest rates and a potential recession. \"While a weakening macro could present new challenges, as demand could be dampened, potentially delaying energy transition efforts, we still anticipate significant growth and inflection points and/or initial adoption across clean transport sub-sectors,\" Peterson wrote in a note Thursday. Specifically, he expects hydrogen and electric-vehicle charging infrastructure enablers to outperform. His top picks are Plug Power and ChargePoint . Both names will likely have strong demand even in a macroeconomic slowdown, have a clear path to drive margin expansion and have sufficient cash and liquidity to fund the business plan, Peterson said. Hydrogen company Plug Power is a leader in the emerging global hydrogen ecosystem, Peterson said. Positive catalysts for the business include Plug's green hydrogen and electrolyzer segments, as well as the growing mobility and stationary power segments, he said. \"The company continues to innovate, pursue global partnerships and acquisitions, and win customer bookings across its lines of business,\" Peterson wrote. He said the company is well positioned to meet its 2026 revenue and margin guidance of $5 billion and 17%, respectively. The stock is down 46% year to date. In the EV charging space, ChargePoint is poised to benefit from increasing demand, Peterson said. The company provides charging hardware, software and services to site hosts and already has an expansive footprint of 350,000 ports in the U.S. and Europe, he pointed out. \"The added investments in its go-to-market efforts are key to seed its target markets. Thus, the reward should be strong, sustainable growth within an expanding customer base as the EV market expands,\" Peterson wrote.

{"text": "This article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME\u2019s politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox.\n\nWhen Joe Biden was a candidate to be his party\u2019s nominee for President, he ran as one of the biggest foes of fossil fuels ever to make a credible run for the White House. He pledged to eliminate net carbon emissions by 2050, ween the country off dirty sources of energy and \u201cend fossil fuel.\u201d He canceled the high-profile Keystone XL pipeline, took millions of acres of possible drilling off the table by scrapping leases to oil and gas companies, and banned imports of Russian oil. He even threatened oil firms with a windfall tax and likened them to war profiteers.\n\nEnvironmental groups went gaga over his rhetoric and action alike, buoying his political alliances and giving climate change activists heart after years of broken promises.\n\nAnd yet, a unique alignment of political and geological confluences may spur Biden in the coming days to do something that will leave those same green allies seeing red.\n\nBiden\u2019s administration is nearing a final decision on a potentially game-changing oil and gas project that has now been under consideration across five presidencies. The proposed Willow project in the northeast section of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska would produce 180,000 barrels of oil each day, create $10 billion in tax and royalty revenues, and create 2,000 construction jobs and 300 permanent ones. The massive project would require as many as five drilling sites, a processing facility, 50 miles of new roads, seven bridges, and an airstrip.\n\nLocal groups, including those representing Alaska Natives, as well as labor unions and the state\u2019s congressional delegation, have all championed the project as a source of good union jobs and money for Alaska\u2019s North Slope.\n\nBut environmental groups and some Native American groups from the Lower 48 oppose the ConocoPhillips project, citing an Interior Department analysis that estimates it would emit at least 278 million metric tons of carbon dioxide over its lifetime and during construction. It also would endanger the local wildlife like polar bears. On Thursday, a coalition of environmental groups\u2014represented by a PR firm with deep ties to the Biden Administration\u2014plans to rally at Lafayette Square across from the White House before delivering another 90,000 comments in opposition to the proposal, which they liken to 76 coal plants running for a year. (Industry groups heartily reject this comparison, noting it compares a lifetime of direct and indirect emissions from Willow with one coal plant\u2019s annual emissions.)\n\nMore from TIME\n\nIf they can\u2019t kill it, the green groups are pushing a scaled-back project, one that would cut three of the proposed five drill sites and better protect calving grounds for the Teshekpuk Lake caribou.\n\nA White House spokesman did not have an immediate comment.\n\nThe Willow proposal dates back to 1999, when the Clinton Administration signed the lease on Alaska\u2019s North Slope. Oil wasn\u2019t discovered there until 2017, and the Trump Administration quickly approved the project. Biden\u2019s team seemed to agree with that thinking, at least until a judge said the environmental costs were not adequately considered and environmental groups separately sounded alarms. A Department of Interior draft impact study released in July appeared to game out how to move forward with the project, although supporters and opponents alike stressed that it was still very much in flux.\n\nThere\u2019s good reason to suspect Biden is poised to make a decision on the Willow project. Because of Alaska\u2019s treacherous conditions, much of the construction needs to happen during the winter months, when the roads are frozen and can accommodate heavy traffic. Warmer temperatures create messy roads that could pause work. In other words, if Biden doesn\u2019t sign off on the project soon, it will languish for another year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re running out of time to be able to do construction this winter,\u201d says Nagruk Harcharek, the new president of Voice of the Arctic Inupiat, a regional council advocating for North Slope communities. \u201cA lot of the construction on the North Slope requires the winter season for ice roads. And if we get too far into February, they\u2019ll have to put it off until next year.\u201d\n\nThat would mean delayed\u2014if not totally unrealized\u2014revenue for local governments and allies, the kind of money that proponents say could prove transformative for a region that isn\u2019t exactly teeming with new opportunities. \u201cWe want to be able to live in the communities that we have so that we can then practice our subsistence culture and be able to go out and hunt in our lands that we grew up on,\u201d Harcharek told me last week. \u201cI remember growing up as a kid, we used to have honey buckets and we\u2019d have to haul those out. Now we can flush our toilets.\u201d\n\nBiden, coming off a less-disappointing-than-expected midterm election season, may be better positioned to disappoint environmental groups than at any point in his presidency. The 2022 elections are barely in his rearview mirror, the 2024 races are still distant, and he can afford to take some incoming criticism from his friends. His allies are bracing for a potential decision, even if they still defend his broader environmental record as one to celebrate.\n\nPlaying into Biden\u2019s decision-making here is the different promises he made as a candidate. While waging rhetorical war on the fossil fuel industry, he also vowed to listen to local communities, including Alaska Natives. As President, he promised to consider Native Americans\u2019 requests and pledged to make sure they were on equal footing. So it\u2019s hard for him to ignore that Alaska Natives are overwhelmingly in support of the project. Within days of her taking office over the summer, Rep. Mary Peltola\u2014the first Alaska Native elected to serve in Congress and a Democrat\u2014urged the Interior Department to approve the project as a way to demonstrate \u201cthe Administration\u2019s commitment to addressing inflation, high energy costs, the need for greater energy security, and environmental justice initiatives.\u201d\n\nUltimately, this is going to be Biden\u2019s call, and his most enviro-minded advisers may have to calibrate their ambitions for scaling back the nation\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels as energy prices remain high and the demand for cheap and easy power is not fading.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign rhetoric won over younger voters and green ones, too. But the trail is one thing, and the art of governing is another one altogether. In that, Biden may have to compromise his own aspirations and accept a new oil drilling regime in a state already threatened mightily by climate change. It is unlikely to be a good look among the green activists, but Biden simply may be out of ways to dodge on this one.\n\nMake sense of what matters in Washington. Sign up for the D.C.

{"text": "In the Arizona Senate race, Kari Lake's defeat was announced on November 3, 2020, to the surprise of many who had backed her as a favorite among conservative voters. Lake's loss was attributed to several factors.\n\nOne factor was her stance on immigration, which was seen as too restrictive by many voters, particularly in a state with a large Latino population. Lake's views on immigration, including increased border security, rejecting sanctuary cities, and opposing drivers licenses for immigrants, did not resonate with many voters.\n\nAnother factor was Kelly's effective grassroots campaign, which included door-knocking and canvassing to reach out to voters and spread his message. He also received significant financial support from out-of-state sources, allowing him to outspend Lake.\n\nAdditionally, Kelly's positions on healthcare, gun control, and the environment were seen as more appealing to Arizona voters, who believed he had a better plan for the state. Lake, on the other hand, was seen as more of an ideological conservative, which cost her support from moderate and independent voters.\n\nFurthermore, Kelly successfully framed Lake as a \"Washington insider\" and a \"creature of the swamp,\" while portraying himself as the outsider and \"champion of change.\" This strategy resonated with many voters who were looking for someone to shake up the status quo in Washington.\n\nIn the end, Kelly's combination of bipartisanship, grassroots organizing, out-of-state money, and strong messaging were key factors in his victory.

{"text": "One of the most significant and challenging choices we face in life is wisely allocating our hard-earned resources. Unfortunately, sometimes we find ourselves in financial predicaments that necessitate seeking additional financial support to maintain our financial stability. When this occurs, finding a reliable financial partner that can provide the necessary funding can be overwhelming, especially for individuals with a poor credit history.\n\nFortunately, there are numerous financial institutions willing to extend financial assistance to individuals with poor credit. In this article, we will explore the most effective options for bad credit loans available in 2022.\n\nCollateral-Backed Loans\n\nThe best starting point for individuals seeking bad credit loans is collateral-backed loans. These loans are secured by a tangible asset, such as a vehicle or property. By providing collateral, the lender can feel more secure in the knowledge that the loan will be repaid. This type of loan may be an attractive option for individuals with poor credit, as the lender may be more willing to approve the loan based on the collateral.\n\nUnsecured Loans\n\nFor individuals without collateral to offer, unsecured loans may be the most suitable option. Unsecured loans do not require collateral, and the lender must rely on the borrower's creditworthiness and ability to make timely payments. Although unsecured loans may come with higher interest rates due to the increased risk, they can still be an effective solution for individuals with poor credit.\n\nPeer-to-Peer Lending\n\nPeer-to-peer lending is another attractive option for individuals with poor credit. This type of lending is unique in that it is funded by individuals rather than traditional financial institutions. As a result, peer-to-peer lenders may be more willing to extend loans to individuals with poor credit. Additionally, peer-to-peer lenders often offer more competitive interest rates than other lenders.\n\nNo-Credit-Check Loans\n\nSome lenders offer no-credit-check loans, which do not require a credit check. These loans are typically available to individuals with poor credit and may come with higher interest rates due to the increased risk. However, they can still be a viable option for individuals in urgent need of financial assistance.\n\nShort-Term Loans\n\nShort-term loans are another option for individuals with poor credit. These loans typically have a shorter repayment period, usually within a few weeks. They may come with higher interest rates, so it is essential to ensure that you can make timely payments.\n\nEmergency Loans\n\nEmergency loans are specifically designed to provide financial assistance to individuals in times of financial crisis. These loans may come with higher interest rates, so it is crucial to ensure that you can afford the repayments.\n\nCommunity Credit Unions\n\nCommunity credit unions are a great option for individuals with poor credit. As nonprofit organizations, they may be more willing to work with individuals who have poor credit. They may also offer more competitive interest rates than other lenders.\n\nPersonal Lending\n\nPersonal lending is another option for individuals with poor credit. Personal lending involves borrowing money from an individual, often a family member or close friend, without the involvement of a traditional financial institution. This type of lending may be more flexible and offer more personalized terms.\n\nThese are some of the most effective bad credit loan options available in 2022. Before taking out a loan, it is essential to carefully consider all your options and ensure that you can make timely repayments. With the right loan and a bit of financial discipline, you can get your finances back on track and make wise financial decisions.", "label": "machine"}

That's an increase of 2.2% from the previous quarter and 8.3% from a year ago.\n\nHouseholds increased debt during the third quarter at the fastest pace in 15 years due to hefty increases in credit card usage and mortgage balances, the Federal Reserve reported Tuesday.\n\nThe biggest contributors to that debt load came from mortgage balances, which rose $1 trillion from a year ago to $11.7 trillion, and credit card debt, which climbed to $930 billion.\n\nThe credit card balance collectively rose more than 15% from the same period in 2021, the largest annual jump in more than 20 years, according to the New York Fed, which released the report. The increase \"towers over the last eighteen years of data,\" a group of Fed researchers said in a blog post on the central bank site.\n\n\"Credit card, mortgage, and auto loan balances continued to increase in the third quarter of 2022 reflecting a combination of robust consumer demand and higher prices,\" said Donghoon Lee, economic research advisor at the New York Fed. \"However, new mortgage originations have slowed to pre-pandemic levels amid rising interest rates.\"\n\nNew York Fed researchers attributed the credit card growth to \"very robust\" consumption, rising prices and consumers using substantial levels of savings that remain on accounts.\n\nAlong with the rise in balances has come an increase in delinquencies.\n\nHowever, while \"delinquency rates are rising, they remain low by historical standards and suggest consumers are managing their finances through the period of increasing prices,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nElsewhere in the report, the Fed said auto loan balances edged higher to $1.52 trillion while student loan debt nudged lower to $1.57 trillion. Student loan debt is the lowest since the second quarter of 2021 amid an extended period of forbearance and the Biden administration's efforts to forgive some education loan debt.\n\nAuto loan debt, while posting only a slight increase on a quarterly basis, is up 5.6% from a year ago.\n\nMortgage balances continued to grind higher amid a sharp increase in interest rates that has seen 30-year mortgages loan rates hover around 7%. Total debt climbed even though originations fell sharply, dropping nearly 17% to $633 billion.\n\nForeclosures remained low even as a pandemic-related moratorium expired. Student loan delinquent rates remained around 4%.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "SVB Securities' Jon Swope thinks some digital-health startups will IPO in the second half of 2023.\n\nSwope said mental-health and women's-health startups will be best positioned to go public.\n\nOther startups will use debt or mergers to buy themselves runway in a downturn, he said.\n\nAfter last year's funding spree, the digital-health market took a tumble in 2022, dragging down the number of healthcare-startup exits.\n\nIn 2021, 15 US-based digital-health companies went public via IPO, according to Rock Health. Only one digital-health company has gone public this year: Akili Interactive Labs, which went public in August in a SPAC deal.\n\nAnd Akili's stock has fallen dramatically from its public-market debut \u2014 when shares surged as high as $37.58 \u2014 to $1.65 as of December 15. Seeing the writing on the wall, digital-health companies like Komodo Health that sought to IPO this year are now putting those plans on hold.\n\nBut SVB Securities' Jon Swope said he thinks the IPO market will reopen for certain digital-health companies in the second half of 2023.\n\nJon Swope, senior managing director in investment banking at SVB Securities. SVB Securities\n\nSwope, the senior managing director of investment banking at SVB Securities and the leader of the firm's digital-health practice, has worked on numerous IPO deals over the years.\n\nHe thinks high-growth healthcare startups that rely on technology, which are either already profitable or have a clear path to profitability, will be first to test the waters.\n\n\"Each day that goes by is another day closer to realizing that your next capital raise, if you need one, has to be your last before becoming a cash-flow positive company,\" he said. \"The days of burning cash with no end in sight, that's over for now.\"\n\nIn particular, Swope said mental-health and women's-health startups, particularly those who serve patients by partnering with employers and health plans, will be in the best position to go public. Those companies have large markets of potential customers and deliver significant value to their patients, to their employers, and to health-plan customers, he said.\n\nDifferent approaches to getting cash\n\nFor the majority of digital-health startups that stay away from the public markets next year, figuring out how to secure capital to ride out the downturn \u2014 without compromising their valuations \u2014 will be critical, Swope said.\n\n\"Those companies that were close to IPO but still burning a lot of cash, their first choice certainly won't be a down-round IPO,\" he said.\n\nThe first choice for healthcare startups, he said, will always be a flat or an up round, where the company lands the same or a greater amount of equity as their previous fundraise. But when startups can't secure a round with those terms, they'll most likely turn to debt.\n\nDebt rounds are considered \"unpriced\" rounds and won't impact the startup's valuation, Swope said. Venture debt also doesn't require founders to give up any of their ownership in a company, unlike an equity fundraise. The catch, of course, is that startups will have to pay those loans back.\n\nSwope said a lot of companies are doing convertible notes, which are a form of short-term debt that typically convert to equity in a future funding round. Seed-stage companies are most likely to issue convertible notes.\n\nA startup's last choice, Swope said, is a down round.\n\nReckoning with inflated valuations\n\nHealthcare startups will try to avoid down rounds at all costs, in part so they don't have to notch a new, potentially reduced valuation, Swope said. Plenty of companies that locked down sky-high valuations in 2020 and 2021 with large funding rounds will face this conundrum.\n\n\"For example, Ro is valued at $7 billion,\" Swope said. \"What's next for companies like that?\"\n\nSwope said he thinks there will be more private companies merging next year, in the style of deals like the October 2021 Headspace-Ginger merger and Thirty Madison's merger with Nurx in February.\n\nBecause there's no outside capital flowing in during those mergers, some startups may attempt those deals to gain stability in a rocky market without having to establish a new valuation, Swope said.\n\n\"Those with cash and cash runway will be in a strong position for negotiating leverage in what will be a more active M&A environment than this past year,\" he said.", "label": "human"}

The problem, which has been ongoing for some time, involves the degradation of visual quality when transmitting photos and videos from one platform to the other.\n\nThe issue has garnered significant attention, with users on both sides of the fence expressing frustration over the compromised image quality. A prominent tech company has taken it upon themselves to raise awareness about the issue, deploying a large billboard advertisement in a prominent location that directly addresses the manufacturer and urges them to take corrective action.\n\nThe billboard features a visually impaired image and a bold message, prompting the manufacturer to address the issue.

{"text": "In a hayloft overlooking the soy fields, dirt roads, and rustic houses that make up their isolated religious colony, eight women gather for a discussion. The eldest ones lead. The youngest two braid each other\u2019s hair. They talk and talk and talk for hours, trying to reach a decision before the men who hurt them return the next day. Often, the women nitpick one another\u2019s words\u2014why they\u2019re chosen, how they\u2019re used, and what they mean. Is \u201cfleeing\u201d their community the same as \u201cleaving\u201d it? Would forcing themselves to forgive their violators equal true forgiveness?\n\nTo some, this may sound like the kind of verbose material more fit for a stage play than a film. But Women Talking, adapted by the writer-director Sarah Polley from Miriam Toews\u2019s 2018 novel, is vibrant cinema. Polley lends the central conversation a visual gravitas normally reserved for epics: She shot the movie on the widest canvas possible using the same kind of equipment that captured Star Wars landscapes, and applied a muted color grading to every frame. She told me last year that she wanted the ensemble film to look like \u201ca faded postcard,\u201d an artifact suggesting that the women (played by actors including Rooney Mara, Jessie Buckley, and Claire Foy) are already abandoning their circumstances. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to shy away from how tremendous the stakes were for them in having this conversation,\u201d Polley said. \u201cThey\u2019re literally talking about ending a world and creating a new one.\u201d\n\nRead: A #MeToo movie devoid of sensationalism\n\nNot that Polley ever shows how their world ends or what it becomes. Women Talking is inspired by real-life incidents that occurred in a Mennonite community in Bolivia: The colony\u2019s female members were repeatedly drugged and raped in the middle of the night, then made to believe they had dreamed the attacks. Like the novel, the film begins after the perpetrators have been arrested and the remaining men have left to post bail and retrieve them. But Polley resists the impulse to depict the most obviously dramatic scenes. She doesn\u2019t show, for instance, the men who crash the meeting, or the two boys who threaten to expose the women\u2019s plans. Instead, her film focuses squarely on the women\u2019s discussion over whether they should stay and fight, or pack up and leave the only home they\u2019ve ever known. \u201cI was really curious about making a film in which people have their minds changed,\u201d she told me. \u201cEven when they\u2019re at odds with each other, they\u2019re hearing each other enough that their positions can shift and change and get to a place where they\u2019re all going in the same direction.\u201d\n\nDespite its heavy setup, the film moves with an unexpected buoyancy. For these women, the worst has already happened. Imagining a way forward, through compromise and commitment, is the more intense, and perhaps more exciting, task at hand. Each woman harbors different belief systems and ideas. To come to anything close to an agreement, they must pay attention to one another\u2019s thoughts, absorb contrasting opinions in good faith, and allow space for every observation\u2014even the most tangential monologue about one woman\u2019s beloved horses. And so, they argue. They tease. They cry. They console. They sing.\n\nEvery scene, as a result, tracks the discussion\u2019s evolution. Minute shifts in tone and demeanor become monumental. To even embark on this meeting, the movie suggests, is a courageous act. \u201cBlack-and-white is a much easier place to live than the middle of a bunch of really messy questions,\u201d Polley said. But that \u201cis sadly where life resides.\u201d Just as a war movie can encourage its audience to appreciate heroism and sacrifice, Women Talking reminds us of the value of language\u2014its capacity for context, for constructive debate, and, in the end, for collective healing.\n\nIn Toews\u2019s novel, a lone man named August attends the meeting. He\u2019s there to transcribe the session\u2014the women are illiterate, having never been allowed an education\u2014but he also serves as a guide for the reader, interpreting the arguments and providing background information. His thoughts aren\u2019t interruptions but essential analyses of each woman\u2019s take.\n\nAs she worked on the adaptation\u2019s script, Polley assumed August\u2019s task. She rewrote the screenplay more than a dozen times, poring over it from every character\u2019s perspective at least twice to \u201ctitrate each moment so that nobody got lost.\u201d In one pass, for example, she wrote as if the lead character were Ona (played by Mara), the group\u2019s levelheaded peacemaker; in another, she took on the perspective of Mariche (Buckley), the most cynical member. \u201cEven if they\u2019re behaving in ways that are really difficult and obstructionist, I could at least feel it from the inside out of how they were arriving there,\u201d Polley said. \u201cI think it was really important to keep everybody in balance, and that no voice was more important than the other.\u201d\n\nThe Herculean exercise paid off: Women Talking feels energizing to watch, because it\u2019s interested in parsing every opinion rather than exhausted by the characters\u2019 thoroughness. Polley, who\u2019s picky about projects\u2014this is the first film she\u2019s directed in a decade\u2014told me that the chance to immerse herself in each character\u2019s mindset helped draw her to the story. Toews\u2019s novel, she explained, examined a reckoning in an unusual way: It moved beyond the immediate, outrage-fueled aftermath and evaluated every argument\u2019s merits and flaws. That\u2019s the opposite of how today\u2019s discourse tends to pan out, especially on social media, where indecision seems intolerable. \u201cTo be a fence-sitter is treacherous territory,\u201d Polley said of being online.\n\nIn the hayloft, however, that\u2019s not the case. The women\u2019s meeting can be seen as a microcosm of how loud declarations must transform into quieter reflections for the thorniest real-life discussions\u2014such as the ongoing debate over sexual harassment in the workplace\u2014to progress. \u201cAt the beginning of the [#MeToo] movement, there were conversations about, like, \u2018I just want to ship all of these men who have done these things to an island, and I don\u2019t ever hear from them again,\u2019\u201d Polley explained. \u201cUnfortunately, there is no such island, you know? \u2026 I think forgiveness is a very, very complex thing that can be misinterpreted in a thousand ways, [but] I\u2019m really curious about what it looks like to create corridors for people to shift and change and redeem themselves \u2026 Yes, we need to tear things down in the process, but hopefully we\u2019re building as much as we want to tear down.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead without forgetting the lessons learned and asking What do we truly want? rather than merely What can we do?\u2014these are the ideas that animated Polley\u2019s treatment of Women Talking. Months into editing, she cut some of her favorite scenes she\u2019s ever shot and replaced the original narration adapted from the book. Instead of having August (Ben Whishaw) as the guide, Polley wrote a fresh passage from the perspective of the hayloft meeting\u2019s youngest member, who, rather than addressing the audience, speaks directly to Ona\u2019s baby, born after the film\u2019s conclusion. The new voice-over suggests that the women did arrive at a better future; at the same time, it treats their summit as a sacred event that needs to be remembered. In other words, Women Talking casts an eye toward the future even as it portrays the past. In a single conversation, time collapses, and what emerges is hope. What could be more epic than that?", "label": "human"}

{"text": "As the calendar flips to a new year, lingering concerns about the stock market's performance in 2020 are still top of mind for many investors. The past year was marked by extreme fluctuations and uncertainty, but ultimately concluded with a rebound from the lows of March 2020, triggered by the pandemic.\n\nRegrettably, a prominent market analyst, Jim Cramer, is warning that unfavorable forces are still at play and could potentially reverse the U.S. economy's progress in 2021.\n\nDuring a recent CNBC interview, Cramer emphasized that despite the stock market's partial recovery, the underlying economic fundamentals remain fragile. He cited the persistently high unemployment rate, which has resulted in millions of workers being laid off or furloughed over the past year. Additionally, he noted that many of the fiscal and monetary stimulus measures implemented in 2020 were either temporary or set to expire soon.\n\n\"The Fed has already tempered its stance on quantitative easing,\" Cramer remarked. \"This could dampen the stock market rally, at least in the short term.\"\n\nHe also criticized the government's spending habits, suggesting that the recent $900 billion relief package is likely to have a limited positive impact.\n\n\"Overall, it appears that 2021 will be a more challenging year for the U.S. economy,\" Cramer stated. \"The recovery will be slow and irregular, with certain sectors such as hospitality, retail, and travel facing significant difficulties.\"\n\nCramer believes that the overall economic environment will remain weak in 2021, requiring investors to exercise extra caution.\n\n\"While I don't want to be overly pessimistic, I think investors should prepare for another tough year,\" he said. \"However, I would caution against taking excessive risk. Individuals should focus on their unique situation and be selective in their investments. Adopt a long-term perspective and seek out companies that can withstand economic turbulence.\"\n\nHe also advised investors to maintain a diversified portfolio and focus on the fundamentals of each stock or market segment.\n\n\"Sometimes the stocks that appear the most attractive don't always perform as expected,\" Cramer noted. \"It's essential to be cautious, even if it means forgoing some potential returns. The market can be unpredictable, and some stocks can become overvalued quickly. It's better to be conservative and miss some gains than take excessive risk and incur losses.\"\n\nIn summary, Jim Cramer believes that 2021 will bring additional challenges for the U.S. economy. However, he remains optimistic that the recovery will continue, provided that investors remain disciplined and maintain a long-term perspective on their investments.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "BEIJING \u2014 Surging Covid infections across mainland China make it harder for the government to achieve zero-Covid without reverting to a harsh lockdown, Macquarie's Chief China Economist Larry Hu said. In the last few days, the daily case count has climbed to around or more than 28,000 \u2014 near levels seen in April during a stringent lockdown in Shanghai, according to CNBC calculations of Wind Information data. The figures showed the last time mainland China saw only a handful of daily infections was in June, shortly after Shanghai eased its restrictions. The latest Covid wave has hit the southern city of Guangzhou, the capital city of Beijing and many central parts of China \u2014 prompting local officials to tighten restrictions on business and social activity this month.\n\nThe road to reopening is set to involve lots of back-and-forth. Larry Hu Chief China economist, Macquarie\n\n\u201cChina might have already passed the point of no return, as it's unlikely to achieve zero Covid again without another Shanghai-style hard lockdown,\" Hu said in a report Tuesday. \"What policymakers could do now is to slow the spread of virus, i.e. flatten the curve, by tightening the Covid controls for the time being.\" Hu pointed to slight changes this month in government policy and propaganda as signs authorities are preparing for reopening in the next six to nine months. But he noted that \"the road to reopening is set to involve lots of back-and-forth.\" Markets have speculated for weeks about the timing of China's departure from its stringent zero-Covid policy. The controls have weighed on the economy, which barely eked out growth while Shanghai was locked down and has posted growth of only 3% during the first three quarters of the year.\n\nwatch now\n\nIn GDP terms, nearly 20% of China's economy was negatively affected by Covid controls as of Monday, close to the high of 21.2% recorded in mid-April during Shanghai's lockdown, Nomura's Chief China Economist Ting Lu said, citing the firm's model. \"Beijing has recently shown early signs of willingness to reopen, and it has rolled out some fine-tuning measures, but the reopening may be a prolonged process with discomfort,\" Lu said in a separate report this week. He said Vietnam's unwinding of its Covid restrictions since fall last year could shed light on the path forward for China. He noted how the Southeast Asian country saw \"no immediate surge in infections after the pivot,\" while its GDP rebounded.\n\nCovid controls tighten in Beijing\n\nLocal authorities in China have faced the difficult task of trying to make Covid measures more targeted, while controlling infections. As of Monday, about 412 million people were affected by lockdown measures in mainland China, according to Nomura estimates. That's up from 340 million the prior week, the report said.\n\nwatch now", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The notion of prohibiting certain types of firearms is gaining traction among experts in the field of politics.\n\nRecent tragic events in Colorado and Georgia have reignited the longstanding discussion surrounding the need for stricter regulations on the possession and purchase of firearms. Many advocates argue that the United States should expand its background check system for firearm purchases and tighten the rules governing the length of time and locations where firearms can be acquired.\n\nHowever, there is growing consensus among experts that prohibiting certain types of firearms is the most effective means of reducing gun-related violence.\n\n\"Prohibiting certain types of firearms would be a prudent step, and Illinois should take the lead in this effort,\" stated Janet Napolitano, a political analyst and former governor of Illinois. \"The statistics on gun-related deaths involving these types of firearms are alarming and should be taken seriously by the Illinois legislature. We are at a critical juncture in our nation's history.\"\n\nStatistics indicate that these types of firearms were involved in over 10,000 deaths in 2020, with nearly 3,000 of those occurring in Illinois.\n\n\"It is past time for Illinois to join the growing number of jurisdictions prohibiting these types of firearms,\" said Jennifer Higgins, a political science professor at the University of Chicago. \"The country requires meaningful and effective legislation to address the gun violence epidemic and save lives.\"\n\nThe Illinois Senate is currently considering a bill that would prohibit the sale, transfer, and possession of these types of firearms in the state. The measure has the support of both Democratic and Republican senators, as well as several police chiefs and mayors from major Illinois cities.\n\n\"This bill is crucial for protecting our communities,\" said Senator Laura Murphy, the bill's sponsor. \"These types of firearms have been used in devastating attacks against our citizens, and it is our responsibility to ensure they are no longer in circulation.\"\n\nThe proposed bill would also prohibit high-capacity magazines and require the registration of existing firearms with the state.\n\n\"This is a comprehensive plan that ensures individuals have the ability to responsibly own firearms while also protecting the public from the dangers posed by these types of firearms,\" said Senator Don Harmon, one of the bill's co-sponsors.\n\nThe bill has received strong support from advocates for stricter gun control, who argue that it is a vital step in the fight against gun violence.\n\n\"We have seen too many senseless deaths resulting from the use of these types of firearms, and we must take action to prevent further tragedies from occurring,\" said Amanda Rodriguez, a representative of the Illinois Coalition to End Gun Violence. \"We urge the Senate to pass this bill and join the growing number of jurisdictions taking this important step.\"\n\nWith several states across the country already having implemented similar bans, the Illinois Senate is under pressure to follow suit.\n\n\"This is a necessary step for Illinois to take,\" said Napolitano. \"It is time for the Senate to act.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Dubai has repealed a 30% excise tax on alcohol sales, a move aimed at revitalizing the economy after the COVID-19 pandemic. The tax, introduced in 2019, was initially welcomed as a way to balance public health concerns with tourism growth. However, the government has since sought to restore Dubai's status as a business and leisure destination.\n\nThe excise tax, which applied to various goods, including alcohol, tobacco, and energy drinks, was a significant revenue source for the government. By removing it, Dubai hopes to encourage more spending by tourists and locals, thereby boosting the economy. The city's economy contracted 8.9% in 2020, its worst performance since records began in 1975, with the tourism sector being severely impacted.\n\nThe government's strategy involves cutting taxes, increasing subsidies, and offering economic aid to businesses and households. The removal of the excise tax will take effect from the start of this month and is expected to have a positive impact on the economy. This follows other measures, such as the reduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) from 5% to 0% in 2020 and the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in the city.\n\nAnalysts believe that the removal of the excise tax is a step in the right direction, as it could stimulate domestic consumption and strengthen the hospitality sector, which is crucial to Dubai's economy. The government is also planning to reduce corporate income tax from 15% to 12%.\n\nThe scrapping of the excise tax comes as Dubai prepares to host the World Expo later this year, which is expected to attract thousands of tourists from around the world. The government's efforts aim to revitalize economic activities affected by the pandemic and strengthen the emirate's position in the global economy.\n\nDubai is not alone in cutting or abolishing excise taxes on alcohol and other consumer goods to stimulate economic growth. Other countries, such as Qatar and Egypt, have also implemented similar measures. However, the decision has been met with criticism from some who argue that it could lead to increased alcohol consumption in a city that is already struggling to balance public health with economic development.\n\nCritics have also argued that alcohol consumption is not compatible with Islamic values and should be discouraged, not promoted. Nevertheless, the government has defended the move, citing its potential to create jobs, increase consumer spending, and attract more tourists to the city. Dubai's government hopes that the scrapping of the excise tax, along with other initiatives, will help the city recover from the economic effects of the pandemic and establish itself as a leading global business and leisure hub.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "A sudden turn of events occurred in the House of Representatives on Wednesday, as the lawmakers gathered to elect a new Speaker of the House. Despite initial expectations, the current Majority Leader, Kevin McCarthy, failed to secure the position, receiving only 203 votes out of 435.\n\nThis unexpected outcome has left the House without a Speaker, and the issue will need to be resolved before a new one can be elected. McCarthy's closest rival, Liz Cheney, is likely to be a strong contender in the subsequent rounds.\n\nMcCarthy's defeat was met with surprise by many of his colleagues, and it marks a setback for the Republican Party, which had been expecting him to become their candidate for the November mid-term elections. As Majority Leader, McCarthy had been a powerful figure in the House for many years, with a wide range of support from both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nThe result is largely attributed to McCarthy's loss of support from some of the most conservative members of the House. Although McCarthy had expressed sympathy for the Republican Party's hardline stance on issues such as immigration and the budget, many of the more conservative House members felt he had strayed too far from their core beliefs.\n\nThe election of a new Speaker of the House is an important event, as the role plays a crucial role in both domestic and foreign policy debates. It is seen as an integral part of the system of checks and balances that are key to the operation of the US federal government.\n\nThe result is likely to have a lasting effect on the Republican Party, as it seeks to retain control of the House in the upcoming November elections. The Republican Party has been facing a number of internal rifts in recent years, and the lack of a strong leader at the top could create further divisions.\n\nThe current state of the House is a reminder of the volatility of American politics. It shows that in a matter of hours, a front runner can become an outcast, and that the future is impossible to predict. It is clear that the House will remain in flux until the issue of the speakership is resolved.", "label": "machine"}

The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry stated that the country will not be \"deceived\" and will continue to negotiate with Russia.\n\nPutin insisted that the ceasefire is intended to provide a chance for negotiations and peace, not just improve Russia's image. The parties agreed to continue intense negotiations on security, conflict status, and humanitarian aspects.\n\nThe proposed ceasefire has been welcomed by international powers, including the US and the UN.

{"text": "The fintech sector has undergone a significant transformation following the 2022 market crash, as investors have become increasingly cautious about new technologies. The euphoria that once surrounded the industry has given way to a more sobering reality, as companies and investors alike have come to realize the significant risks involved in fintech.\n\nDespite the attractive opportunities that fintech can offer, the risks remain substantial, and a company's seemingly solid fundamentals can quickly unravel. As a result, investors are now placing greater emphasis on thorough research, precise timing, and a cautious approach when considering fintech investments.\n\nThe use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, for example, has been a major area of focus for fintech companies in recent years. However, the 2022 market selloff has made investors more wary of investing in AI-related projects, as they recognize the potential risks of overreliance on these technologies without fully understanding their implications.\n\nSimilarly, the robotics industry has been an area of innovation for fintechs, but the 2022 crash has made investors think twice about investing in this sector. Robotics has always been an expensive area to explore, and the sudden downturn in the stock market has highlighted the potential risks and rewards associated with this technology.\n\nBlockchain technology has also been a focus of investment for fintech companies, but the volatile nature of cryptocurrency prices has made investors more conservative in their approach. While many fintechs continue to invest in blockchain projects, investors are now more cautious about allocating capital to these initiatives.\n\nThe 2022 market crash has forced fintech companies to rethink their strategies and focus more on mitigating risks and ensuring that they are investing in more reliable technologies. Some companies have chosen to pursue ambitious projects with greater attention to detail and a more considered approach to risk. Others have opted to focus on more conservative investments, prioritizing reliability and long-term sustainability over short-term gains.\n\nOverall, the 2022 market crash has been a valuable learning experience for fintech companies, and many are taking the lessons they've learned to heart. As the industry moves forward, it will be interesting to see how this newfound caution manifests itself in the way fintech companies invest and use new technologies. While it may mean slower growth for the industry as a whole, it should also result in more reliable and sound investments for the long-term.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "A recent blog post by two researchers at Safety Detectives disclosed a massive data breach involving over 200 million Twitter usernames and email addresses linked to the accounts.\n\nThe researchers, Sanyam Jain and Or Kawir, stumbled upon the data while investigating a website called \"Otouch.fr.\" The site, which was taken down after the researchers contacted Twitter, allowed users to search for Twitter profiles by name, email address, or phone number.\n\nThe data was likely harvested from a Twitter bug called an \"information leakage vulnerability\" that was fixed in June 2019. This flaw allowed hackers to collect data for all Twitter users and leak the information.\n\nThe researchers believe the hackers created a rogue app or website that posed as a legitimate application or website, and then used the bug to harvest the data from users who granted it access to their accounts.\n\nThe data could potentially allow hackers to target Twitter accounts, including those with high-profile owners, and gain access to sensitive information such as private messages, direct messages, and payment information.\n\nTwitter was alerted to the data breach by the researchers and had already taken action to fix the vulnerability. The company urged users to change their passwords if they use the same ones across multiple services.\n\n\"We're thankful to the researcher who brought this to our attention. Out of an abundance of caution, we're prompting people to change their passwords on all services where they may have reused the password. If a user used the same password for Twitter and other services, they should take extra caution and update their passwords and practice good account security practices,\" a Twitter spokesperson said.\n\nThis breach is the latest in a string of hacks that have targeted the microblogging platform. In 2017, hackers used an exploit to gain access to hundreds of millions of accounts, including those of famous users like Ellen DeGeneres and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. And in 2018, hackers stole tens of millions of users' passwords, which were made available for sale online.\n\nThe breach also comes just days after Twitter announced that it was closing the Vine video-sharing platform, which had been used by more than 200 million users to share short-form videos.\n\nSecurity researchers said the breach is a reminder that even with the most secure applications, users should be vigilant about the data they share and the websites they visit. They also cautioned that while the data breach in this case was quickly addressed by Twitter, users should still be wary of phishing scams and other malicious actors who may attempt to exploit such information.\n\n\"This is yet another reminder of how important it is to be aware of the data you're sharing online and the applications you're granting access to,\" Jain and Kawir said. \"Always be cautious about the links you click, the information you share and the sources you trust.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "A significant event occurred on Tuesday, November 17, when a country in East Asia launched a projectile into the air. This was the second such test this month, and the first in almost two years.\n\nThe projectile, reportedly a long-range missile, was launched from the northwest region of the country and traveled approximately 800 kilometers before landing in the ocean. This event has sparked a strong reaction from the international community.\n\nThe leader of a neighboring country condemned the test, stating that it poses a significant threat to regional security. The leader of a major world power issued a statement saying that the situation will be handled, and that all available options are being considered. The leader of another country in the region also condemned the test, stating that it violates international law and poses a grave threat to their nation.\n\nThis country has been prohibited from conducting such tests since 2006, when the United Nations Security Council imposed sanctions. Despite this, the country has continued to pursue its nuclear and missile programs. This latest test serves as a reminder of the country's willingness to disregard international agreements and pursue its weapons programs despite the threat of sanctions.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council is expected to convene and discuss the launch, and will likely impose additional sanctions on the country. A major ally of the country has also condemned the test and urged the country to stop its nuclear and missile programs.\n\nThis event is particularly concerning because it demonstrates the country's continued development of its weapons capabilities. If the projectile had been launched at a different angle, it could have reached a major continent. This adds to the already high tensions between the country and a major world power, and could further destabilize the region.\n\nThis event also highlights the failure of the major world power to effectively respond to the country's nuclear and missile programs. The administration has failed to impose meaningful sanctions or develop a plan to deter the country from pursuing its weapons programs. The administration has also been criticized for its handling of the crisis, with critics arguing that its strategy has failed to deter the country.\n\nIn response to the launch, the major world power and a neighboring country conducted joint military exercises in the ocean. The major world power also sent two strategic aircraft to the region as a show of force. These flights, along with additional sanctions, are aimed at pressuring the country to stop its nuclear and missile programs.\n\nUltimately, a diplomatic solution will be necessary to resolve the crisis. The major world power and its allies must work together to find a way to convince the country to abandon its nuclear and missile programs. Until then, tensions between the major world power and the country will likely remain high, and the threat of further tests will loom.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Windows 11, the latest iteration of Microsoft's long-running operating system, is here\u2014at least for those with supported PCs. If you take the leap, you'll notice a slick redesign, with a Chrome OS-like centered taskbar and rounded corners on apps. Under the hood, it's largely the same OS, but there are some new features you should know how to use. These tips will help ease the transition from Windows 10 to Windows 11.\n\nRealign the Start Button\n\nThe first thing that will jump out at you is the placement of the Start button. Long located in the lower-left corner of the screen, it's now centered with the rest of the icons on the taskbar. But don't worry, you can change it back. Right-click the taskbar and open Taskbar Settings. Select the Taskbar behaviors drop-down and change Taskbar alignment to Left. This will move all your taskbar icons to the left and put the Start button back where it belongs. For more on personalizing the Windows 11 taskbar, check out our guide.\n\nA Simplified Right-Click Menu\n\nThe right-click menu now focuses only on the most important settings. Should you need more settings\u2014print, set a new background, or view the full file location, for instance\u2014select Show more options to open a spill-over menu.\n\nCustomize the Quicks Setting Panel\n\nWindows 11 separates the Quick Settings that appear in the Action Center in Windows 10 from that panel's notifications. Click the area of the taskbar that has Wi-Fi, speaker, and, battery icons to open a settings menu that lets you control Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, airplane mode, battery saver mode, and more. To add or remove settings buttons here, click the pencil-shaped Edit quick settings button. Unpin what you don't want or click Add to make new features accessible from the Quick Settings menu.\n\nEasier Desktop Management\n\nMicrosoft replaces the old Task View button with a redesigned icon on the taskbar, which makes it easier to create and manage multiple desktops. Just hover over the icon to see any open virtual desktops or create a new desktop. These desktops can then be rearranged as needed, and apps that are in one desktop can be dragged into another.\n\nGather Your Widgets\n\nWhile Windows 10 dabbled in widgets, Windows 11 goes all in. If you want to check the weather, look up sports scores, track stock prices, watch nearby traffic, manage your Outlook calendar, cross tasks off your to-do list, or read the latest news, a new Widgets icon on the taskbar has you covered. You can customize the widgets to suit your needs, rearrange them on the page, and manage your newsfeed preferences through Microsoft News.\n\nMore Multitask Layouts\n\nMicrosoft has supported the snap and resize feature since Windows 7, but it gets a boost in Windows 11 with Snap Layouts. You can still drag and drop windows into place, but in Windows 11, you can also hover over the Maximize button on supported apps to see a menu of layout options\u2014one large window on the left and two on top of each other on the right, or three in a row, for example. Click to select your preferred formation and then move your apps into place.\n\nChat With Teams\n\nMicrosoft Teams\u2014the company's free messaging, calling, and videoconferencing app\u2014is built into Windows 11. Launch video calls and start chats from a new Chat icon on the taskbar; no need to open the Microsoft Teams app. You can sync your contacts through the Teams mobile app, but if your contacts don't use Teams, send invites via email or text. You can also have SMS conversations with contacts even if they don't sign up for Teams, and they can join a video chat from a web link.\n\nGet Things Done With Focus Sessions\n\nWith messages and video chats popping up throughout the work day, it's easy to get distracted as the work piles up. Focus Sessions in Windows 11 encourages you to set aside time for work that requires uninterrupted, deep focus. It's currently available in the new Alarms & Clock app, and offers a quick way to get at least 30 minutes of distraction-free work time. If you go beyond 45 minutes, the app automatically schedules a five-minute break about midway through your session. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide on setting it up for your PC.\n\nStreamlined File Explorer Menu\n\nWith Windows 11, Microsoft streamlines the ribbon at the top of the File Explorer menu. Now only cut, copy, share, sort, and view options are visible; no need to wade through multiple tabs and settings you'll never use. Windows 11 also adds a New button for creating new folders and shortcuts, as well as documents based on the programs you have installed.\n\nPair Input/Output Devices\n\nWindows 11 gets a full-featured Sound menu with the ability to pair new input and output devices. Open Settings > System > Sound and click Add device under the Output section to link external speakers or other devices. Or click Add device under Input to connect an external microphone. You will then be given the choice to connect via Bluetooth, wireless docks, and more. Scroll down to the Advanced section and click All sound devices to view a full list of all input and output devices that have been connected to your PC.\n\nNew Sound Modes\n\nYou get extra control over your audio output in Windows 11, including mono audio and enhanced audio modes. To go mono, open Settings > System > Sound, then enable Mono audio to combine the left and right audio channels. For enhanced audio\u2014which includes bass boost, virtual surround, room correction, and loudness equalization\u2014click All sound devices under the Advanced section of the Sound menu, choose a device to access the Properties menu, and enable Enhance audio.\n\nView the App List\n\nWindows 11 adds an extra step to view your full list of installed apps. Instead of opening the Start menu and immediately seeing the App List next to your live tiles, you have to click the All Apps button in the Pinned section of the Start menu. You will then be able to browse the list or search for a specific app.\n\nPins Apps to the Start Menu\n\nSpeaking of live tiles, they're finally gone in Windows 11. In their place is a more simplistic Start menu where you can pin apps for easy access. Open the App List, right-click on an app, and select Pin to Start to move it to the Pinned section. You can then drag the app into your preferred position. To remove apps, right-click and choose Unpin from Start.\n\nCustomize the Start Menu\n\nIn Windows 10, the Settings button appears above the Start button when you tap it. Not so in Windows 11, but you can add it back(Opens in a new window) via Settings > Personalization > Start > Folders. Here, you can also add File Explorer, other common folders, and Network icons.\n\nGet Better Recommendations\n\nThe new Start menu has a Recommended section for recent files and frequently used apps. To customize what appears here, open Settings > Personalization > Start so you can tell Windows to stop showing recently installed apps, frequently used apps, or recently opened items in the Start menu, App List, and elsewhere.\n\nChange Default Apps\n\nIn Windows 10, it\u2019s easy to choose a default app, but with Windows 11, the process is more complicated, as you need to specify a default app for every file type. Open the Settings app and tap on the Apps section in the left-hand menu. Choose Default apps, click on the app you want to set as the default for a file type, and you\u2019ll see a list of all file types it\u2019s capable of handling. Click on the file type you want, and select an app from the menu that pops up. For a full rundown of the process, check out our guide.\n\nChoose Your Theme\n\nThemes make a return in Windows 11, but this time they work hand-in-hand with dark mode. Open Settings > Personalization and select one of the default themes to change the background image, sounds, cursor, accent color, and color theme all at once. Open Themes to edit current themes, add new themes from the Microsoft Store, or create your own.\n\nBetter Battery Visualization\n\nWindows 11 does a better job than its predecessor of helping you visualize your battery usage data. Go to Settings > System > Power & battery, then open the Battery usage tab. Here you will find a chart that shows how much power you have used over the last few days or hours.

{"text": "The solemn funeral of Pope Benedict XVI, led by his successor Pope Francis, was held on Saturday, with supporters of the late pontiff seeking his swift path to sainthood. The body of Benedict, who passed away at the age of 92, was transported in a hearse with a Swiss Guard escort through rain-soaked streets of Rome to the Vatican basilica, where it was placed before the main altar accompanied by the solemn tolling of bells.\n\nFrancis and 13 cardinals, along with the Swiss Guards and dozens of bishops, priests, and members of religious orders in white garments, filed into the basilica and silently prayed for over a minute before singing a hymn. After a second silent prayer, Francis praised Benedict for his humility, grace, and commitment to the church, calling him a \"valiant witness of the Gospel.\"\n\nThe funeral Mass marked the first time two pontiffs, past and present, have joined in such a solemn setting since the last two popes, John Paul II and Benedict, celebrated a service together in October 2012. Tens of thousands of people gathered along the streets of Rome to pay their final respects to the German-born pope who stepped down in 2013 after eight years in office.\n\nThe official spokesman of the Vatican, Father Federico Lombardi, described the atmosphere as one of deep respect and affection, with Pope Francis visibly emotional. The hearse carrying Benedict's body was driven to St. Peter's Basilica after being borne in procession from the Church of Sant'Anastasia in the Vatican, accompanied by the Swiss Guards and cardinals.\n\nSupporters of the late pope have already begun the process for making him a saint, with the Vatican saying that Benedict's body will be laid to rest in a crypt in the grotto of St. Peter's Basilica. Once the funeral Mass was over, Pope Francis placed Benedict's pallium on top of the body before saying a final farewell and giving a blessing.\n\nBenedict's life, from his humble beginnings in Bavaria to the highest office in the church, has been marked by a unique and historic dual papacy with Francis. The two pontiffs are seen as the best of friends and collaborators. In the eyes of the faithful, Benedict was seen as a steady, reassuring presence at a time when the church faced numerous problems.\n\nHe was a staunch traditionalist who reined in the progressivism of his predecessor, John Paul II, but who, in the latter years of his papacy, displayed a more open-minded attitude to the complex issues facing the church today. Supporters of Benedict have said that it was his efforts that saved the Catholic Church from a potential schism, and his willingness to reach out to other Christian denominations that opened the door to an unprecedented dialogue and understanding.\n\nThose who saw Benedict in his final years said they were struck by his modesty and deep humility in the face of grave illness. Benedict's funeral also marked the first time in almost a century that a former pope had been laid to rest in St. Peter's Basilica.\n\nThe Vatican had said Benedict was buried in the same spot reserved for his predecessor, John Paul II. However, it was decided to bury him in a different place, just a few steps away from John Paul's tomb, to show the two popes were united in life and in death. Benedict's short reign as pope changed the church and the world in many ways, and his legacy may be his part in advancing Christian unity and his efforts to reach out to other churches and faith traditions.\n\nWith a legacy like that, it is no wonder why so many are now seeking sainthood for Benedict. The Catholic Church has long held that in order to become a saint, a person must have demonstrated heroic virtue and led an exemplary life of faith and devotion. As his funeral comes to an end, Pope Francis and the faithful will have Benedict in their hearts and prayers as they continue to seek his path to sainthood.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "By Pavel Polityuk\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (Reuters) -Russia acknowledged on Monday that scores of its troops were killed in one of the Ukraine war's deadliest strikes, drawing demands from nationalist bloggers for commanders to be punished for housing soldiers alongside an ammunition dump.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said 63 soldiers had died in the fiery blast which destroyed a temporary barracks in a former vocational college in Makiivka, twin city of the Russian-occupied regional capital of Donetsk.\n\nIt said the accommodation had been hit by four rockets fired from U.S.-made HIMARS launchers, claiming two rockets had been shot down. Kyiv said the Russian death toll was in the hundreds, though pro-Russian officials called this an exaggeration.\n\nRussian military bloggers, many with hundreds of thousands of followers, said the huge destruction was a result of storing ammunition in the same building as a barracks, despite commanders knowing it was within range of Ukrainian rockets.\n\nSeparately, Ukraine said on Monday it had shot down all 39 drones Russia had launched in an unprecedented third straight night of air strikes against civilian targets in Kyiv and other cities.\n\nUkrainian officials said their success proved that Russia's tactic in recent months of raining down air strikes to knock out Ukraine's energy infrastructure was increasingly a failure as Kyiv beefs up its air defences.\n\n'EACH MISTAKE HAS A NAME'\n\nUnverified footage posted online of the aftermath of the Makiivka strike on the Russian barracks showed a huge building reduced to smoking rubble.\n\nIgor Girkin, a former commander of pro-Russian troops in east Ukraine who has emerged as one of the highest profile Russian nationalist military bloggers, said the death toll was in the hundreds, later editing his post to include wounded in that figure. Ammunition had been stored at the site and Russian military equipment there was uncamouflaged, he said.\n\nAnother nationalist blogger, Rybar, said around 70 soldiers were confirmed dead and more than 100 wounded.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"What happened in Makiivka is horrible,\" wrote Archangel Spetznaz Z, another Russian military blogger with more than 700,000 followers on Telegram.\n\n\"Who came up with the idea to place personnel in large numbers in one building, where even a fool understands that even if they hit with artillery, there will be many wounded or dead?\" he wrote. Commanders \"couldn't care less\" about ammunition stored in disarray on the battlefield, he said.\n\n\"Each mistake has a name.\"\n\nRussia's acknowledgement of scores of deaths in one incident was almost without precedent. Moscow rarely releases figures for its casualties, and when it does the figures are typically low - it acknowledged just one death from among a crew of hundreds when Ukraine sank its flagship cruiser Moskva in April.\n\nRussia has seen in the new year with nightly attacks on Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv, hundreds of kilometres from the front lines. The nightly attacks mark a change in tactics, after months in which Moscow usually spaced such strikes around a week apart.\n\nAfter firing dozens of missiles on Dec. 31, Russia launched dozens of Iranian-made Shahed drones on Jan. 1 and Jan. 2. But Kyiv said on Monday it had shot down all 39 drones in the latest wave, including 22 shot down over the capital.\n\nKyiv said the new tactic was a sign of Russia's desperation as Ukraine's ability to defend its air space had improved.\n\n\"Now they are looking for routes and attempts to hit us somehow, but their terror tactics will not work. Our sky will turn into a shield,\" presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak said on Telegram.\n\nIn his latest nightly speech, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy praised Ukrainians for showing gratitude to the troops and one another and said Russia's efforts would prove useless.\n\n\"Drones, missiles, everything else will not help them,\" he said of the Russians. \"Because we stand united. They are united only by fear.\"\n\nUkraine's air defence systems worked through the night to bring down incoming drones and to warn communities of the approaching danger.\n\n\"It is loud in the region and in the capital: night drone attacks,\" Kyiv Governor Oleksiy Kuleba said.\n\nRussia has turned to mass air strikes against Ukrainian cities since suffering humiliating defeats on the battlefield in the second half of 2022.\n\nIt says its attacks, which have knocked out heat and power to millions in winter, aim to reduce Kyiv's ability to fight. Ukraine says the attacks have no military purpose and are intended to hurt civilians, a war crime.\n\nRussia has flattened Ukrainian cities, killed thousands of civilians and annexed swathes of Ukraine since Putin ordered his invasion in February, calling Ukraine an artificial state whose pro-Western outlook threatened Russia's security.\n\nUkraine has fought back with Western military support, driving Russian forces from more than half the territory they seized. In recent weeks, the front lines have been largely static, with thousands of soldiers dying in intense warfare.\n\nIn a stern New Year's Eve message filmed in front of a group of people dressed in military uniform, Putin vowed no let-up in his war.\n\n\"The main thing is the fate of Russia,\" Putin said. \"Defence of the fatherland is our sacred duty to our ancestors and descendants. Moral, historical righteousness is on our side.\"\n\n(Reporting by Reuters bureaux; Writing by Peter Graff, Lidia Kelly, Dan Peleschuk and Michael Perry; Editing by Clarence Fernandez, Robert Birsel, Alexandra Hudson)", "label": "human"}
{"text": "A prominent entrepreneur, Jeff Bezos, has expressed skepticism towards the notion of achieving a perfect balance between professional and personal life. Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, argues that the phrase \"work-life balance\" can have a detrimental impact on how individuals approach their daily lives.\n\nIn a recent interview, Bezos emphasized that the term \"work-life balance\" implies a separation between work and personal life, which he believes is unrealistic. He suggested that instead of striving for a balance, individuals should aim for a harmonious coexistence between their professional and personal lives.\n\nBezos' perspective is rooted in his experience as the founder and CEO of Amazon, where he has implemented initiatives to promote a healthier work environment. He believes that having both a fulfilling personal life and a successful professional career is essential for achieving overall well-being.\n\nBezos' views on the importance of work-life balance are not new. In the past, Amazon has faced criticism for its demanding work culture, which has led to employee burnout and stress. To address these concerns, Bezos has introduced measures to reduce work intensity and improve employee well-being.\n\nBezos' comments highlight the need for a more holistic approach to achieving a balance between work and life. He emphasizes that individuals should strive for a balance that is not a binary decision between professional life and personal life, but rather a continuous cycle of work and personal growth.\n\nIn conclusion, Bezos' perspective on work-life balance serves as a reminder that achieving a perfect balance between work and personal life is not always possible. However, by adopting a holistic approach and prioritizing both personal and professional growth, individuals can achieve a more harmonious and fulfilling life.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The conclusion of 2020's trading period has resulted in losses, marking the culmination of a tumultuous year for market fluctuations. The S&P 500 index registered a decline of 8.6% for the year, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 5.6% lower. The Nasdaq Composite, heavily reliant on tech stocks, suffered an even more significant decline of 12.2%.\n\nThe fourth quarter proved particularly challenging for market participants, as they navigated the ongoing pandemic and the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook. The S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq Composite all experienced declines, with respective losses of 8.5%, 5.5%, and 9.8% during this period.\n\nThe primary driver of market losses was the technology sector, which was severely impacted by a selloff in prominent tech stocks, including Apple and Tesla. This sector concluded the year with a decline of 20.8%.\n\nThe financial sector also exhibited weakness, ending the year down 14.5% despite a late-year rally. The energy sector, meanwhile, registered a decline of 12.2% for the year.\n\nDespite a relatively quiet trading week, major indexes ultimately closed lower. The S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq Composite finished the week with declines of 0.4%, 0.6%, and 0.8%, respectively.\n\nAnalysts attributed the market losses to investors taking profits following a tumultuous year of trading. With the COVID-19 pandemic still ongoing and the economic outlook remaining uncertain, many investors are hesitant to commit to long-term positions in the market.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts predict that the market will likely experience continued volatility in the near term as investors strive to assess the economic outlook. Progress on vaccine rollouts and the effectiveness of stimulus measures will be crucial in determining the market's direction.\n\nAdditionally, concerns surrounding corporate earnings growth persist. Analysts anticipate a significant slowdown in earnings growth for 2021, primarily due to the uncertain economic outlook and the ongoing pandemic's impact.\n\nDespite the market losses, the U.S. stock market remains attractive relative to other global markets. According to S&P Global, the S&P 500 is currently trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 26.5, which is higher than the historical average of 16.6.\n\nIn summary, 2020 has been a tumultuous year for the markets, but analysts caution that the outlook for 2021 remains uncertain. Investors should prepare for continued volatility in the coming months as the market navigates the ongoing pandemic and the economic outlook for 2021.", "label": "machine"}

Average 30-year fixed rates remain well below their November 2022 peak, when they rose above 7%.\n\nRates are expected to start trending down this year, and that trend could be accelerated if we experience a recession.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been hiking the federal funds rate to tame inflation, and the latest economic data shows that its efforts are starting to pay off. But many worry that the Fed has overcorrected, putting the economy at risk of a serious slowdown.\n\nMortgage rates today\n\nMortgage type Average rate today This information has been provided by Zillow.

This is a 15-basis-point increase from the previous week.\n\nThe 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is the most common type of home loan. With this type of mortgage, you'll pay back what you borrowed over 30 years, and your interest rate won't change for the life of the loan.\n\nThe lengthy 30-year term allows you to spread out your payments over a long period of time, meaning you can keep your monthly payments lower and more manageable. The trade-off is that you'll have a higher rate than you would with shorter terms or adjustable rates.\n\n15-year fixed mortgage rates\n\nThe average 15-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.68%, a single basis point decrease from the prior week, according to Freddie Mac data.\n\nIf you want the predictability that comes with a fixed rate but are looking to spend less on interest over the life of your loan, a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage might be a good fit for you. Because these terms are shorter and have lower rates than 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, you could potentially save tens of thousands of dollars in interest. However, you'll have a higher monthly payment than you would with a longer term.\n\nHow do Fed rate hikes affect mortgages?\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been increasing the federal funds rate to try to slow economic growth and get inflation under control. So far, inflation has slowed somewhat, but it's still well above the Fed's 2% target rate.\n\nMortgage rates aren't directly impacted by changes to the federal funds rate, but they often trend up or down ahead of Fed policy moves. This is because mortgage rates change based on investor demand for mortgage-backed securities, and this demand is often impacted by how investors expect Fed hikes to affect the broader economy.\n\nAs inflation starts to come down, mortgage rates should, too. But the Fed has indicated that it's watching for sustained signs of slowing inflation, and it's not going to stop hiking rates any time soon \u2014 though it may start opting for smaller hikes at its next few meetings.\n\nWhen will mortgage rates go down?\n\nMortgage rates increased dramatically in 2022, but they've started to trend down somewhat over the past couple of months.\n\nIn November 2022, the Consumer Price Index rose 7.1% year-over-year, a significant slowdown compared to the previous month. This is good news for mortgage borrowers and the broader economy.\n\nAs inflation comes down, mortgage rates likely will, too. But the Fed is looking for sustained signs of slowing inflation, which means it's not likely to stop hiking rates any time soon, though officials have said they expect to start slowing the pace of hikes. This should help ease the upward pressure on mortgage rates.\n\nAre HELOCs a good idea right now?\n\nMany homeowners gained a lot of equity over that past couple of years as home prices increased at an unprecedented rate. But because rates are so high now, tapping into that equity can be expensive.\n\nFor homeowners looking to leverage their home's value to cover a big purchase \u2014 such as a home renovation \u2014 a home equity line of credit (HELOC) may still be a good option.\n\nA HELOC is a line of credit that lets you borrow against the equity in your home. It works similarly to a credit card in that you borrow what you need rather than getting the full amount you're borrowing in a lump sum.\n\nDepending on your finances and the type of HELOC you get, you may be able to get a better rate with a HELOC than you would with a home equity loan or a cash-out refinance. Just keep in mind that HELOC rates are variable, so if rates start to trend up further, yours will likely increase, as well.", "label": "human"}

Non-members may not get competitive rates\n\nWho is no medical exam life insurance meant for?\n\nA no medical exam life insurance policy may hold a certain appeal for older applicants and those in failing health. However, the life insurance market is the opposite of what you might expect. These policies are best for young people (typically under 50 years old) in good health. The no medical exam process is often more efficient, streamlining your approval, and life insurance companies can only do this with low-risk applicants.\n\nIf a provider sees red flags that might disqualify you, it won't necessarily prevent you from getting coverage. Instead, the agent would most likely offer to run more conventional life insurance quotes for you.\n\nWhat types of no medical exam life insurance can I get?\n\nMany no medical exam life policies share the obvious features of no medical exams, faster underwriting, and higher premiums for lower benefits. Exceptions apply depending on the insurer. Even within this type of life insurance, providers offer different plans.\n\nAccelerated underwriting life insurance\n\nAccelerated underwriting may seem like a given with no medical exam life insurance. To some degree, it is. This type of life insurance policy uses electronic resources to gather information and run algorithms to evaluate risk. This system then sets your coverage and premiums.\n\nWhile the sources could expand in the future, accelerated underwriting uses a few basic things: criminal records, prescription drug records, and motor vehicle records. All of this creates a risk profile used to bind policies. Because of public records information, the pricing on this type of no medical exam life insurance is most likely comparable to standard life policies. Depending on the available information and other factors, this underwriting process could take longer than a traditional medical exam life policy.\n\nSimplified issue life insurance\n\nSimplified issue life insurance streamlines the underwriting process with no medical exam. Instead, applicants answer a few basic health questions. This policy type will be more expensive for less coverage later on. Companies are taking a more considerable risk by not going through a thorough underwriting process with extra verification. So the premium rises to counterbalance the risk.\n\nGuaranteed issue insurance\n\nThink of this as the life insurance automatically purchased by your employer. It could also be a life policy offered by your bank or credit union. Payouts are small. Generally, these policies cover death benefits like funeral costs and a small allowance for family members after death. As the name suggests, applicants will not be denied. One thing to keep in mind is these policies often use a graded death benefit. In other words, your chosen beneficiary will not get the full benefit if you pass away within the first year after binding the policy.\n\nCompare the best no medical exam life insurance\n\nBest online resources: Haven Life\n\nHaven Life offers term policies for healthy adults with limits as high as $3 million.

Some companies issue policies without asking medical questions, but underwriting involves risk assessment. Whether due to age, prescription history, or other medical history, buyers should have life insurance alternatives involving a medical exam.\n\nThe following companies are the highest-ranked life insurance companies according to the 2022 J.D. Power U.S. Individual Life Insurance Study on overall customer satisfaction.\n\nWhy trust our recommendations?\n\nLife insurance companies have introduced living benefits/accelerated death benefits and other options to use policies as investment tools. As the name suggests, death benefits do not pay until after the buyer's death. Regardless, Personal Finance Insider knows how important it is to identify the right insurance company for your needs.\n\nAll insurance reviews and articles are fact-checked, and rates are checked at the time of our review. Our responsibility is to our readers, which means providing the most accurate information to guide you in the right direction. Our editor's ratings are based on insurance guidelines, performance, and more.\n\nOur methodology\n\nThe coverage and riders offered are vital parts of our evaluation. We also look at the speed of payouts, customer satisfaction, and financial strength ratings. All of these factor into the immediate and long-term performance of the life insurance companies we review.\n\nIf you're looking for more information about a specific life insurer, our individual reviews offer a deep dive into individual policies, riders, and more. The same considerations are used for all competitors to ensure readers have the edge to make informed decisions in an ever-changing market.\n\nHow to pick the best no medical exam life insurance policy for you\n\nParticularly when choosing life insurance, customization is critical. Buyers don't need to add every rider, but a little research goes a long way in selecting the right company. Some applicants will not qualify for a no medical exam life insurance policy. A life insurance agent can help you run quotes that make sense for you. Then agents can offer realistic insurance policy options and review the costs and benefits of each.\n\nAsking friends and family which insurance agent they use could be your first step to finding the right life policy. Factors like age, medical history, and financial goals play key roles in your decision. So we do not recommend asking loved ones about individual policies. Instead, let a qualified insurance professional find the best policies for you.\n\nFAQs\n\nIs a no medical exam life insurance policy right for me? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. No medical exam policies are easiest for young applicants with no significant health issues. Older applicants can buy with some companies, but acceptance is not guaranteed. If you do not qualify for the no medical exam policy you want, insurance agents can help you explore alternatives. No medical exam policies offer less coverage with higher premiums in most cases.\n\nHow can life insurance companies use my medical history with no medical exam? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. No medical exam means life insurance companies will not check your blood pressure, cholesterol, etc. However, companies have access to prescription history and other personal records, and underwriters base decisions partly on this history.\n\nShould I choose whole or term life policies with no medical exam? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. The rules of term vs. whole life insurance policies are the same with no medical exam as it would be otherwise. A term policy has an expiration date, and extensions or conversions to a whole life policy are not guaranteed. If anything, your rate may be higher if you try to convert your policy. The insurer looks at you just as it would any other applicant of your age, health, etc. A whole life policy locks in premiums and payouts.\n\nAre there alternatives to a no medical exam policy? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Insurance agents can quote you medical exam policies if you're denied a no medical exam option. An experienced agent may be able to assess your application before starting the process to avoid official denials. If you're concerned about premium limits, you can explore options like IUL (indexed universal life) for permanent life insurance that increases your benefit as long as you make premium payments.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The recent decision by French President Emmanuel Macron to provide Ukraine with 50 tanks, armored personnel carriers, and heavy machine guns has sparked a complex web of foreign policy concerns for the West. This move has been met with criticism from some European Union states, who fear it could lead to a broader arms race with Russia. However, the gift is seen as a sign of support from a significant European power, and has raised the stakes for other countries to provide aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe West's decision to arm Ukraine has been a contentious issue, as the Russian-backed separatist movement in eastern Ukraine has continued to escalate in recent years. Ukraine has long sought foreign assistance to protect itself from a resurgent Russia, which annexed Crimea in 2014 and continues to support separatist fighters in the Donbas region.\n\nThe French tanks are a crucial victory for Ukraine in the battle for international support, which is seen as key to the country's security. They also put immense pressure on other EU countries to follow suit, lest their collective response to the conflict in Ukraine be seen as inadequate.\n\nThe gift of 50 armored vehicles to Ukraine is a much-needed boost to President Zelensky's government, which is fighting a Russian-backed insurgency in the east of the country. The vehicles come from France's army and are much-needed assistance for a nation outgunned by the Russian military.\n\nThe tanks represent the first major delivery of arms to the country in the current conflict and could represent the beginning of a larger military assistance package from the West. The move is a clear signal to the Kremlin that the West is ready to take a tougher stance on Russia's aggression in Ukraine.\n\nRussia is unlikely to take the news lightly and may respond with its own military deployments or countermeasures. However, such a response could push Moscow and the West into a deeper conflict.\n\nThe French tanks represent a departure from the long-standing international policy of restraint and non-intervention in Ukraine. This stance was adopted in the wake of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea, and since then the West has shied away from any direct military intervention.\n\nHowever, with the Russian-backed separatists' recent escalations and the continued escalation of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, some countries are now reassessing their policies and considering how best to respond.\n\nThe French gift of tanks to Ukraine will likely spark a debate in the West about the wisdom of further arms transfers to the country. It could also open the door for greater intervention in the conflict, and for a more robust effort to stop it.\n\nAt the same time, it could force the United States and other Western countries to think carefully about the implications of a more muscular response to Russian aggression. To be effective, any Western push-back must be conducted in a way that avoids escalating tensions with Russia even further.\n\nThe decision by the French President to provide Ukraine with tanks is a bold one, and will undoubtedly have far-reaching ramifications for the conflict in Ukraine and beyond. While the tanks could be a first step towards greater Western support for Ukraine, the international community must take a cautious approach that considers the risks of further inflaming the situation.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Christian Childers, 26, is survived by his fiancee and young sons. He tried to clean up the mold before he fell ill. Courtesy of Lorie Peterson\n\n26-year-old Christian Childers died Monday after long-term exposure to toxic mold. Mold grew in his family's home after flooding from Hurricane Ian last September. Childers' asthma made him particularly susceptible to health risks from mold.\n\n\n\nInstead of spending time with his family at home, 26-year-old Christian Childers spent Christmas Eve in the hospital in a medically induced coma after a severe asthma attack led to cardiac arrest. The potential cause of this asthma attack: toxic mold that had been growing in his apartment for months.\n\nChristian Childers and his fianc\u00e9e Kendra Elliot first noticed the mold growing after Hurricane Ian flooded their home in September, Elliot told NBC affiliate WBBH-TV.\n\nDespite attempts to get in contact with FEMA and the Red Cross, the family was forced to live with the mold for months, according to a GoFundMe set up by a family friend. The couple moved their family of five into the living room to avoid the toxic growth, but the mold continued to affect Childers, who had asthma and had to go to the hospital multiple times.\n\nOn December 24, Childers suffered an asthma flare-up and was struggling to breathe, Elliot told WBBH-TV. They went to his parents house, where he still wasn't able to catch his breath, and then to the emergency room.\n\n\"They were on their way to the emergency room, and they didn't make it,\" Elliot told the local news station. \"They had to pull into a fire station, and he went into cardiac arrest. He died, and they had to work on him for an hour to get his heartbeat back before they got him on the way to the hospital.\"\n\nChilders was initially put into a medically induced coma in the hospital to give his body a chance to recover from a hypoxic brain issue caused by a lack of oxygen, but on January 2 he died.\n\nAdditionally, during Childers' hospital stay the family's landlord sent them an eviction notice, which has been reviewed by Insider. Lorie Peterson, a friend of the family, said Elliot and her mother and two sons are still searching for a new place to live.\n\nStory continues\n\nMold is particularly dangerous for people with lung diseases like asthma\n\nMold stains on a damp wall. Ekspansio/Getty Images\n\nMold growth in the home is usually related to excess moisture in the environment \u2014 for instance, a Category 4 storm can cause plenty of water-related damage. Some molds can release toxins into the air, which can irritate the lungs, but not all molds found in the home are toxic.\n\nWhile most people won't suffer health effects from living in a home with small amounts of mold, it can be dangerous for people with lung diseases or people who are immunocompromised.\n\nPeople with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or compromised immune systems should not stay in a moldy home, even while it is being cleaned, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Severe reactions to mold can include fevers and shortness of breath.\n\nOtherwise healthy people can experience symptoms from mold exposure including coughing and wheezing.\n\nWhat to do if there is mold in your home\n\nThe best way to stop mold exposure is prevent it from growing in the first place.\n\nThe CDC recommends that people control humidity levels in their homes through ventilating bathrooms, laundry and cooking areas; promptly fix leaks; and thoroughly clean and dry after flooding. Using an air conditioner or dehumidifier during humid and warm months can be helpful, as well as avoiding carpeting rooms that may gather moisture, like bathrooms.\n\nIf, however, you can already see or smell mold in your home, you should try to remove it as soon as possible using commercial cleaning products or a mixture of bleach and water. If the mold covers a large area, it is best to get professional help, and you may need to vacate the home while it is being cleaned.\n\nRead the original article on Insider", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Boeing's aircraft delivery pace slowed significantly in October, largely due to a structural issue affecting some of its 737 models. The company delivered nine new aircraft last month, a significant drop from the 19 deliveries in September and less than a third of its total deliveries in October of last year.\n\nThe slowdown was primarily caused by the structural flaw, which has prompted Boeing to suspend production of the affected 737 models and delay deliveries. Additionally, the company is working to reduce its overall production rate in response to decreased demand in the wake of the pandemic.\n\nThe structural issue was discovered after high-pressure testing and has been found to affect a substantial number of aircraft in Boeing's fleet. The company is taking steps to repair the flaw and aims to resume normal production by the end of the year.\n\nBoeing is also dealing with production delays from its suppliers and other issues. Despite these temporary setbacks, the company remains confident that it will eventually be able to deliver its aircraft on schedule.\n\n\"We remain focused on achieving our 2021 production goals, including reaching a sustained rate of 31 737 MAXs per month by year-end,\" Boeing stated.\n\nBoeing's October deliveries included six 737 MAXs and three 787 Dreamliners. Its year-to-date deliveries stand at 172, down from 296 a year ago. The company is expected to deliver fewer than 300 aircraft by the end of the year, compared to more than 500 a year earlier.\n\nThe decline in deliveries has been compounded by a decline in orders. Boeing received just six orders in October, down from 20 a year ago. It has received 173 orders so far this year, down from 595 a year earlier.\n\nBoeing's deliveries for the year will likely remain below normal as the company continues to work on fixing the structural flaws and dealing with its suppliers. The company is also likely to see fewer orders going forward as the pandemic continues to affect the global aviation industry.\n\nDespite the challenges, Boeing remains optimistic about its future. The company is testing new technologies such as automated manufacturing, virtual reality, and additive manufacturing to speed up production and reduce costs.\n\nBoeing is also making an effort to improve its customer service, including a new website that allows customers to track their orders and receive personalized advice.\n\nThe company is investing in new technologies to improve its product lines and expand its customer base.

{"text": "ABSTRACT breaks down mind-bending scientific research, future tech, new discoveries, and major breakthroughs. See More \u2192\n\nScientists at Brookhaven National Laboratory have uncovered an entirely new kind of quantum entanglement, a phenomenon that causes particles to become weirdly linked, even across vast cosmic distances, reports a new study. The discovery allowed them to capture an unprecedented glimpse of the bizarre world inside atoms, the tiny building blocks of matter.\n\nThe mind-bending research resolves a longstanding mystery about the nuclei of atoms, which contain particles called protons and neutrons, and could help shed light on topics ranging from quantum computing to astrophysics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe exciting discoveries took place at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), a specialized facility at Brookhaven in New York that can accelerate charged atoms, known as ions, to almost light speed. When these ions collide\u2014or even just pass near each other\u2014their interactions expose the inner workings of atoms, which are governed by the trippy laws of quantum mechanics.\n\nAll kinds of weird stuff occurs in this tiny realm, but quantum entanglement in particular is so strange that Albert Einstein called it \u201cspooky action at a distance.\" This phenomenon occurs when particles become intertwined with each other, causing their properties (such as spin or momentum) to sync up, even if they are billions of light years apart. Quantum entanglement has been demonstrated countless times in laboratories, but the entangled particles have always belonged to the same group and possessed the same charge, such as photons, which have no charge, or electrons, which are negatively charged.\n\nNow, for the first time ever, scientists at Brookhaven have captured interference patterns that are created by the entanglement of two particles with different charges, a breakthrough that has opened up a completely new window into the mysterious innards of atoms that make up visible matter in the universe, according to a study published on Wednesday in Science Advances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere's never been any measurement in the past of interference between distinguishable particles,\u201d said Daniel Brandenburg, a physics professor at the Ohio State University who co-authored the new study, in a call with Motherboard. \u201cThat's the discovery; the application is that we get to use it to do some nuclear physics.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn't even, in a sense, trying to find something so fundamental about quantum mechanics,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhen we realized that there's something really interesting going on here, that was a really big surprise to me.\u201d\n\nBrandenburg and his colleagues achieved this milestone with the help of a sensitive detector called the Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC, or STAR, that captured interactions between gold ions that were boosted to the brink of light speed. Clouds of photons, which are particles that carry light, surround the ions and interact with another type of particle, called gluons, that hold atomic nuclei together.\n\nThese encounters between the photons and the gluons set off a chain of events that ultimately created two new particles, called pions, which have opposite charges\u2014one positive and one negative. When these pions careened into the STAR detector, the precision instrument measured some of their key properties, such as velocity and angle of impact, which were then used to probe the size, shape, and arrangement of gluons inside the atomic nuclei with a precision that has never been achieved before.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt's like a microscope in the sense that you use a photon to look at something,\u201d Brandenburg explained. \u201cIn this case, we're using really, really high-energy photons, where their wavelength is short enough that we can actually look at the inside of an atom.\u201d\n\nScientists have imaged atomic nuclei at lower energies before, but attempts to probe these structures at high energies has always produced a puzzling result. Nuclei in these experiments look way bigger than they should, according to models, an outcome that has puzzled scientists for decades.\n\nNow, the STAR collaboration has now solved this mystery by pinpointing a blurring effect that is linked to the photons in the experiment. Essentially, past studies captured one-dimensional glimpses of nuclei that did not account for important patterns in photons, such as their polarization direction. The new study included this polarization information, allowing Brandenburg and his colleagues to probe the nuclei from two angles, parallel and perpendicular to the photon\u2019s motion, producing a two-dimensional view that matches theoretical predictions.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the team is even able to make out the rough positions of key particles in the nucleus, such as protons and neutrons, as well as the distribution of gluons. It also offers a new way to unravel persistent mysteries about the behavior of atoms at high energies.\n\n\u201cAs you peer deeper inside the nucleus, to the parts of the nucleus that have less and less energy, they're very important for how the nucleus holds together, but we actually don't know a lot about that part of the nucleus,\u201d Brandenburg said. \u201cSo as you go to higher and higher energies, you really don't know what it looks like.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's why more measurements with higher precision will be poised to really make a statement about this energy dependence and what the heart of the nucleus is doing at these different scales,\u201d he added.\n\nTo that point, Brandenburg hopes to repeat this technique, and versions of it, at RHIC and other facilities like the Large Hadron Collider, in order to tease out the long-hidden details inside atomic nuclei.\n\nGazing into atoms at high energies could help scientists resolve some of the most intractable problems in science, including the grand mystery of how the quantum world can coexist with our reality, which is governed by the much more familiar rules of classical physics. It also has practical applications, especially for quantum computing, a technology that aims to revolutionize computations using the strange rules of the quantum world.", "label": "human"}

There were some options, but most shades, tools, and brands catered to white people.\n\nToday, many people with disabilities might face a similar sense of exclusion when they browse the cosmetics aisle: There are often few, if any, products designed for someone with limited fine motor skills.\n\nA team of L'Or\u00e9al engineers, researchers, and beauty experts is working to change this.\n\nOn Wednesday, at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, L'Or\u00e9al unveiled a handheld, computerized makeup applicator called Hapta. It's designed for people with limited hand and arm mobility.\n\nHapta is a nod to the word haptic, which is a type of vibrating motor technology used in many smartphones and in adaptive devices for people with disabilities. The product is expected to be available in US stores at the end of this year and globally next year at a cost of $149 to $199.\n\nGuive Balooch, the global chief of L'Or\u00e9al's technology incubator \u2014 the division that developed Hapta \u2014 said the move to create more advanced products for people with disabilities in beauty was long overdue.\n\nNow, Balooch said the makeup world was approaching a revolution in technology that could help many with disabilities.\n\n\"The past three to five years has excelled in miniaturizing large-scale machines,\" Balooch said. \"Hapta is essentially a miniature robotic arm that requires lots of machine learning and complicated algorithms. Combine that with our sense of purpose and drive around inclusion, I truly believe this is the result of the marriage of these two forces.\"\n\nMaking makeup application possible for millions\n\nGuive Balooch, the global vice president of L'Or\u00e9al's technology incubator, said a movement in the beauty world on disability inclusion was overdue. L'Or\u00e9al\n\nMakeup applicators for people with disabilities do exist. There are blush brushes designed to be easy to grip or mascara with a large handle that's easier to steady with your fingers. Yet most of these products have been developed by startups or small businesses, not by a major cosmetics company. And L'Or\u00e9al says a high-tech option like Hapta isn't on the market.\n\nThe feedback from Hapta testers with cerebral palsy, with Parkinson's disease, and from people affected by a stroke has been positive, Balooch said.\n\n\"They told us they didn't feel they could be part of this industry,\" he said. \"Having someone else apply it wasn't enough for them. They wanted to apply makeup on their own. They now feel they can be part of this.\"\n\nHapta is essentially a miniature robotic arm that helps users stabilize a tube and apply lipstick. L\u2019Or\u00e9al\n\nApproximately 10 million Americans have essential tremor, a neurological movement disorder that often causes the hands to shake. Nearly 1 million people in the US have Parkinson's disease, and some 764,000 Americans have at least one symptom of cerebral palsy. Both Parkinson's and cerebral palsy can affect hand and arm mobility.\n\n\"People who could never apply lipstick before can now do that,\" Balooch said. \"There's a confidence that comes from that. That's what our user feedback has been.\"\n\nL'Or\u00e9al began developing Hapta about a year ago, after Balooch met with Anupam Pathak, the CEO of Liftware, a startup that created high-tech eating utensils for people with a tremor or limited hand or arm mobility. Pathak and Balooch started talking about how Liftware users asked whether the company could create tools for applying makeup.\n\n\"This was codesigned with people with cerebral palsy, people with Parkinson's, and experts in the field,\" Balooch said. \"I hope this will inspire the industry. It's not just something that these people deserve \u2014 it's deeply linked to our purpose.\"\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's Hapta lipstick applicator is set to be available in US stores sometime this year at a cost of $149 to $199. L\u2019Or\u00e9al\n\nOver the past few years, Balooch said, L'Or\u00e9al engineers have been working to make the company's packaging easier to open for people with disabilities. L'Or\u00e9al has also been expanding the use of QR codes on its products to help people with limited visibility learn more about an item.\n\nHapta is set to be compatible only with Lanc\u00f4me lipsticks for now, though L'Or\u00e9al plans to create fittings that would make the device adaptable with other lipsticks.\n\n\"The reality is that people who have motor-skills or hand-mobility impairments need to be able to do daily tasks,\" Balooch said. \"It is time for this type of technology.\"", "label": "human"}
{"text": "A plethora of individuals have longed to invest in sports teams, but for those who have achieved this feat, it often doesn't yield the desired outcome. This is exemplified by the new owners of several top-tier soccer clubs worldwide.\n\nOver the past decade, a few prominent acquisitions in the sports industry have involved European soccer powerhouses, with owners of clubs like Manchester United, Real Madrid, and Paris Saint-Germain investing hundreds of millions of dollars in pursuit of success. However, the returns on these investments have been inconsistent, with some teams experiencing significant increases in value while others have seen no returns at all.\n\nTake, for instance, Manchester United, one of the most renowned soccer clubs globally. Its current owner, American business magnate Joel Glazer, acquired the club in 2005 for \u00a3790 million ($1.07 billion). Despite more than a decade passing, the club's estimated value remains at \u00a32.21 billion ($2.97 billion), a mere \u00a3430 million ($571 million) more than what Glazer paid for it.\n\nAlternatively, consider Paris Saint-Germain, the French club purchased by Qatar Sports Investments in 2011 for an estimated \u00a3130 million ($173 million). Over the years, their value has skyrocketed to an estimated \u00a32.36 billion ($3.16 billion), resulting in a substantial return on investment of over \u00a32 billion ($2.66 billion).\n\nThe factors contributing to the varying returns on investment are multifaceted. Manchester United's lack of profitability was largely attributed to its substantial wage bill, which had to be significantly reduced following Glazer's takeover. Conversely, Qatar's approach to Paris Saint-Germain involved substantial investments in both players and infrastructure, ultimately leading to the team's success and increased attractiveness to sponsors.\n\nThe trend of investors acquiring top-tier European soccer teams is unlikely to slow down anytime soon. There are numerous incentives for wealthy individuals or organizations to purchase clubs, including the prestige of owning one of the world's most recognizable teams and the potential rewards of running a successful business. Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge that investing in soccer does not always yield a profit. With the costs of running a team continuing to rise, it is becoming increasingly challenging for new owners to generate a profit.\n\nIn conclusion, purchasing a soccer club is akin to any other investment. For the fortunate few, it may yield a positive return. However, for many more, it is likely to be a costly endeavor with limited returns.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "I can\u2019t decide which is worse: The Republican politician who lied, his Republican colleagues who have remained silent about the lies, or the voters who didn\u2019t mind being duped by a liar.\n\nThe George Santos saga has been everywhere since The New York Times uncovered a mountain of lies he peddled during his campaign, lies he admitted to \u2014 excuse me, \u201cembellished\u201d\u2014 and that continued to pile up after he was elected.\n\nIn the private sector, you typically pay the price for lying on your resume. But this is Congress, and now a lying Long Island Republican is a member. The idea of an admitted liar swearing fidelity to the Constitution is as grotesque as it is sickening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSantos remains shameless. Sadly, so have his Republican colleagues, unless the word \u201cformer\u201d or \u201coutgoing\u201d precedes their name \u2014 no risk there in condemning one of your own. Or we get a muted call for the House Ethics Committee to investigate. But not a single incoming Republican member of the 118th Congress has spoken out.\n\nHow ironic that Republicans would cast out Liz Cheney, a lifelong conservative, for seeking truths about a different liar, but about Santos, the party of Honest Abe has remained silent.\n\nBut they know. They know how disgraceful this is, how damaging it is to a party whose only political achievement has been to set the ethics bar even lower.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, multiple insiders close to the House GOP leadership knew Santos was lying but said nothing.\n\n\u201cWhat can you do?\u201d one senior Republican aide told The New York Post. \u201cHe was the only Republican candidate.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s also part of a razor-thin majority in the House. Invertebrate Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) first praised Santos\u2019s victory but then went silent. Well, sure. Santos promised to back McCarthy for House speaker (can you believe the promises of a proven liar?) and might be a key vote for someone still scrambling for support to win the speakership.\n\nIt probably explains the wind mockery of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.). The MAGA crank now supporting McCarthy\u2019s speakership bid (apparently in exchange for committee assignments) defended Santos. She accused former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) of having \u201czero grace\u201d for tearing into Santos during an interview on Fox News \u201cwhile George is admitting and apologizing for lying about his resume.\u201d\n\nWait: You\u2019re more upset about Gabbard calling Santos out for lying than you are about Santos lying? Then explain your Daily Caller op-ed a week earlier when you wrote, \u201clying to the base is a red line for me.\u201d\n\nYa suppose Greene would\u2019ve been shrieking a different line had Santos been a Democrat?\n\nToo bad Politico can\u2019t go back to New York\u2019s 3rd Congressional District now and talk to Santos supporters before his interview with Gabbard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDaniel Zimmerman, a 70-year-old registered Democrat and no relation to Santos\u2019s Democratic opponent, Robert Zimmerman, told Politico at the time that he\u2019d vote for Santos again despite The Times\u2019 blockbuster account. \u201cI\u2019m a Republican because Democrats, they\u2019re destroying our country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust the Democrats on anything they say,\u201d said another Santos supporter, who wouldn\u2019t give her name for privacy reasons.\n\nI wonder what voters like that are saying now?\n\nOther residents in the district have protested, and Santos has been taking a beating on his Facebook page, but that\u2019s about all voters can do. They can\u2019t recall him. The Constitution contains no such mechanism for recalling federal lawmakers. Santos can only resign or be expelled, which requires a vote of two-thirds of House members.\n\nRepublicans won\u2019t do it. If they did, his district would hold a special election, which a Democrat would almost surely win, shrinking the GOP\u2019s tiny House majority.\n\nInstead, expect this:\n\nHey, Republicans! How will you address the George Santos scandal?\n\nAnswer: Hunter Biden had a laptop.\n\nLegal developments might compel Republicans to vote for expulsion. Santos is facing several potential investigations into his questionable past, which could result in jail time. Certainly a better use of our tax dollars instead of paying his Congressional salary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Santos has yet to admit he lied. Instead, he\u2019s done a linguistic tap dance, calling his lies \u201cembellishments,\u201d a \u201cpoor choice of words,\u201d or the contorted \u201cJew-ish,\u201d to explain his campaign claim about being a \u201cproud American Jew.\u201d (His district is more than 20 percent Jewish.)\n\n\u201cA lot of people overstate on their resumes or twist a little bit,\u201d Santos told WABC radio.\n\nI see. Everyone else is doing it. That\u2019s the excuse we make to justify doing something we know is wrong. I\u2019ve never understood why \u201ceveryone else is doing it\u201d is such an attractive idea to a nation that prides itself on its individuality as ours does or why it\u2019s such an attractive idea to any Republican whose party extolls the virtues of personal responsibility and accountability.\n\nConservative outlets certainly aren\u2019t going there. Those that once embraced Santos are now ignoring him. It\u2019s easier to find the Gabbard interview on Google than on the Fox News website. I couldn\u2019t find a single criticism of Santos on any major conservative outlet. Whadda surprise!\n\nThese are the guys who say they want their country back.

{"text": "The evening air was tranquil at Wrigley Field, as the Chicago Cubs prepared to face off against the St. Louis Cardinals in the inaugural game of the season. The starting lineup was set, and the anticipation was palpable. One name, however, stood out from the rest: Tucker Barnhart.\n\nThe 26-year-old catcher, acquired from the Cincinnati Reds during the offseason, brought an impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to the game. He was a two-time All-Star in the minor leagues, a two-time winner of the Reds' defensive player of the year award, and had a remarkable track record of throwing out over 40 percent of attempted base stealers throughout his eight-year career.\n\nDespite his impressive credentials, what set Barnhart apart from the Cubs' new players was his potential impact on the team's pitching staff. Throughout his career, he had developed a reputation as one of the most skilled pitch framers in the league, able to subtly influence the trajectory of pitches, giving pitchers a strategic advantage in high-pressure situations.\n\nThe Cubs' starting rotation, boasting aces Kyle Hendricks and Yu Darvish, as well as lefty Jose Quintana, was already one of the best in the game. Barnhart's presence could potentially add an extra layer of control to an already solid pitching staff. But how exactly could he achieve this?\n\nThe answer lies in the realm of cognitive psychology.\n\nTo comprehend Barnhart's influence on the Cubs' pitchers, one must first grasp the psychological underpinnings of pitching. According to Dr. Kenneth Ravizza, a sports psychology professor at Cal State-Fullerton, the key to a successful pitch is anticipation and visualization. When pitching, a pitcher must have a clear plan in mind before initiating his motion. He must be able to vividly imagine the pitch in his mind's eye and have a good sense of what will unfold.\n\nBarnhart, with his innate ability to frame pitches, can aid pitchers in this process. By subtly guiding the trajectory of pitches, Barnhart can help pitchers focus their attention on the desired target, making it easier to visualize a successful pitch. Furthermore, Barnhart is able to accurately predict a pitcher's motion, allowing him to adjust his framing if necessary.\n\n\"It's one thing to be able to read the pitch before it's thrown,\" Ravizza said. \"But it's a whole other level to be able to read the pitcher's body language and interpret his motion. It takes years of practice and experience to do it, but Barnhart has been able to consistently do it for a long time now, which is an incredible asset for any pitching staff.\"\n\nBeyond his framing abilities, Barnhart also brings a veteran presence and an understanding of how pitchers think, something that can be invaluable to the Cubs' young pitchers.\n\n\"He's been around the block,\" Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. \"He's seen a lot of different situations, and he's been successful in them. He's got a very calm demeanor and he communicates well with pitchers. He's the kind of guy you want to have behind the plate, because he knows how to take care of business and understands the game.\"\n\nAs the season unfolds, Barnhart's influence on the Cubs' pitching staff will be fascinating to observe. One certainty, however, is that having a seasoned catcher like Barnhart behind the plate will be a significant asset for the Cubs' success this year.", "label": "machine"}

The impact on asset markets, however, is less obvious as potential inflationary pressures from the economic reopening could force central banks to keep interest rates higher for longer.\n\nchart\n\nThe consensus among economists that the U.S. economy will slip into recession this year is unusually and remarkably strong. This points to a poor outlook for earnings and equity performance, even if some investors say this is the perfect set-up for a contrarian bullish investment strategy.\n\nIn the near term, however, China COVID fears may overshadow the long-term benefits and weigh on sentiment accordingly.\n\nIt's fair to say investors are glad to see the back of 2022. World stocks lost around $14 trillion and posted their second-worst annual performance on record, and bonds had their worst year in decades. Together, a typical '60-40' portfolio of stocks and bonds had one of their worst years in almost a century.\n\nMuch of that can be blamed on nearly 300 rate hikes around the world last year. But while much of the global tightening has been delivered the full effects have not been felt.\n\nA cautious start to the year for markets, and a gloomy Chinese PMI report, would come as no surprise.\n\nThree key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Tuesday:\n\n- Australia manufacturing PMI (December)\n\n- China Caixin manufacturing PMI (December)\n\n- U.S. manufacturing PMI (December)\n\nReporting by Jamie McGeever in Orlando, Fla.; Editing by Jonathan Oatis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n\nOpinions expressed are those of the author.

{"text": "A tale of transformation: how cars and batteries reshaped the world\n\nThe meteoric rise of Tesla Inc. has been accompanied by a series of striking images, many of which highlight the potential of the electric vehicle revolution and the company's ambitions.\n\nEach of these photographs, from the first Tesla Roadsters to the massive battery plant in Nevada, tells a unique part of the story.\n\nThis image depicts the first Tesla Roadster to roll off the production line at the Fremont factory in 2008, marking the beginning of electric vehicles' mainstream entry into the auto market.\n\nThe Roadster, priced around $100,000 at the time, was the first fully electric car produced by the company. Although it didn't gain widespread popularity, it signified Tesla's determination and helped spark the EV revolution.\n\nThe Roadster was succeeded by the Model S luxury sedan, introduced in 2012. However, it was the introduction of the smaller and more affordable Model 3 that propelled Tesla into the mainstream, with demand quickly outpacing the company's production capacity.\n\nA bottleneck was alleviated in 2017 when Tesla opened the Gigafactory in Nevada, the world's largest battery production facility. The massive facility produced batteries for the company's cars as well as its \"Powerwall\" home battery systems and commercial energy storage products.\n\nTesla's recent success has been driven by the growing demand for electric vehicles, which is helping the company reduce its reliance on internal combustion engine cars.\n\nThe increasing popularity of EVs is evident in this image, showing electric vehicles queuing up at a charging station in California. Electric vehicle sales are expected to more than double by 2023, and some predict that EVs will dominate the auto market by 2030.\n\nThe growing demand for electric vehicles has also sparked a new era of competition in the auto industry, as other carmakers rush to produce their own electric cars.\n\nThis has been aided by the increasing availability of lithium-ion batteries, the primary power source for electric cars. The number of lithium-ion battery factories around the world is expected to reach more than 50 by 2024, up from around 20 in 2018.\n\nThe increasing availability of lithium-ion batteries has also made electric vehicles more affordable, with some cars now costing around the same as a traditional gasoline or diesel car.\n\nThis image shows workers installing lithium-ion batteries at the Tesla Gigafactory in Nevada, which is now producing batteries at an unprecedented rate.\n\nThe increase in battery production has helped drive down the cost of electric cars, making them a more attractive option for consumers. However, there is still work to be done before electric vehicles become truly ubiquitous.\n\nThe cost of batteries still accounts for a significant portion of the total cost of an electric vehicle, and the process of battery production still emits a substantial amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\n\nDespite these challenges, the rapid rise of Tesla has shown that electric vehicles are no longer just a dream. The company's success has helped transform the auto industry and changed the way the world thinks about cars, batteries, and electric vehicles.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The Evolution of Electronic Building Blocks\n\nA technological phenomenon that has been unfolding since the 1950s has reached unprecedented heights in recent years. The industry of electronic components has grown exponentially, with companies designing and manufacturing innovative and powerful devices that shape our daily lives. From powering computers and smartphones to medical devices and cars, these components are ubiquitous and have become a vital part of the technological landscape.\n\nElectronic Component Manufacturers\n\nThese companies are multinational organizations that design, manufacture, and market electronic components. They develop new chips, circuitry, and components for consumer products, and can be found in almost every industry.\n\nFor instance, Intel is a well-known electronic component manufacturer based in California. The company produces chips for consumer PCs, laptops, and mobile devices, and its microprocessors have been powering PCs since the 1980s. Intel has since expanded its product range to other consumer electronic devices, such as tablets and smartphones.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) is another major electronic component manufacturer, also based in California. Founded in 1969, the company produces computer processors and graphics cards for the consumer market. AMD's Ryzen and Radeon lines of products have gained a strong following among consumers and businesses.\n\nThe electronic component industry also includes large companies such as Texas Instruments, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), and Qualcomm, which manufacture chips for a variety of consumer products. These companies develop a range of technologies, including digital signal processors (DSPs), Wi-Fi chips, modems, processor cores, microcontrollers, and embedded microprocessors.\n\nHow Electronic Components Shape Our Daily Lives\n\nElectronic components are used in a wide range of devices, from cars and smartphones to medical devices and robots. These components are the brains behind these devices, controlling how they operate and interact with us. In today's world, it's impossible to imagine a world without electronic components.\n\nIn cars, electronic components are used for various tasks, such as controlling the car's lights and engine, radio, navigation system, brakes, and safety systems. Electronic components also power a car's entertainment system, allowing drivers to listen to music, make phone calls, and access a wide range of applications.\n\nSmartphones, of course, use electronic components to power their operating systems, cameras, apps, and other features. Without these components, smartphones wouldn't be able to connect to the internet, access data, or allow users to take pictures and videos.\n\nIn the medical industry, electronic components are used to diagnose diseases, control medical equipment, and monitor patient health. They are used to control imaging systems such as CT scans and MRIs and can even help doctors deliver precise treatment.\n\nFinally, electronic components are also used in robots, helping them carry out complex tasks and interact with the world around them. They are used in industrial robots, autonomous vehicles, and even artificial intelligence systems.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt's clear that electronic components have become an integral part of our lives. From powering our cars to monitoring our health, electronic component manufacturers are a key part of the global economy and will continue to drive innovation and growth for years to come.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "A humble German convenience store chain, Aldi, has become the fastest-growing grocer in the United States, with a remarkable journey spanning over a century. Founded by two brothers, Karl and Theo Albrecht, in 1913, the company started as a small grocery store in Essen, Germany. The Albrechts' parents were grocery store owners, making it a natural progression for their sons to follow in their footsteps.\n\nInitially, the brothers operated two stores, Aldi Nord and Aldi S\u00fcd, with distinct focuses. Aldi Nord concentrated on perishable goods, while Aldi S\u00fcd specialized in dry and packaged products. Their strategy was to sell only essential items and negotiate discounts with manufacturers, enabling them to undercut larger supermarkets.\n\nIn the 1950s, the brothers split the businesses, and each expanded across Germany. Karl focused on Europe, while Theo concentrated on Germany and added more stores. By 1960, there were over 400 Aldi stores in Germany.\n\nIn the late 1970s, the Albrecht brothers' sons took over, sharing a vision to provide customers with quality products at low prices and minimal effort. To achieve this, they adopted a \"limited assortment\" model, limiting product selections to reduce costs and negotiate deeper discounts. This model became the Aldi standard.\n\nBy the mid-1980s, the companies had over 4,000 stores, mostly in Europe. In 1988, Aldi Nord opened its first US store, quickly gaining popularity due to its low prices and convenient shopping experience. Aldi S\u00fcd followed, and by 1996, there were over 200 US stores. Today, there are over 2,000 Aldi stores in 35 states.\n\nAldi's success in the US can be attributed to its low prices, convenient locations, and \"limited assortment\" model. With over 20 million customers per week, it has become a major player in the US grocery market, ranking third behind Walmart and Kroger.\n\nAldi has also expanded globally, with over 10,000 stores in 20 countries, including Australia, the UK, and Poland. With an estimated 50 million customers worldwide, it's no wonder Aldi has become a retail giant. The Albrecht brothers' vision and drive have turned their small family grocery store into one of the world's largest retail chains.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "A review of the 2021 market trends reveals a period of stabilization following the turbulent 2020, with investors seeking clarity amidst recession concerns. The year has been marked by significant shifts in investor sentiment, prompting a reevaluation of stock valuations.\n\nOne approach to assessing a stock's worth is through the lens of multiples, which provide a framework for comparing stocks and gauging their relative performance. However, multiples can be volatile, influenced by factors such as sector, company size, and market conditions, resulting in varying multiples over time.\n\nAs recession risks escalate, multiples assume heightened importance. In times of economic slowdown, stock prices may decline, necessitating a closer examination of company valuations to avoid overpaying.\n\nFortunately, many stocks continue to trade at relatively low multiples, offering investors opportunities for value investing. Conversely, stocks with high multiples may be overvalued and more susceptible to recession-related downturns, warranting caution.\n\nMeanwhile, stocks with low multiples may be undervalued, potentially indicating fundamental issues. Investors should exercise prudence when utilizing multiples, considering additional factors like earnings growth and economic health.\n\nThe 2021 market has presented unique challenges, and investors must remain vigilant regarding multiples and their impact on stock valuations as the year unfolds.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "In the early months of 2020, Alison Fisher, a prominent figure in the Wall Street recruitment industry, began to generate significant attention. With only five years of experience as an executive recruiter for top firms, Fisher had already built an impressive client base and earned the respect of her peers.\n\nHowever, as Fisher's influence grew, so did the number of claims against her. Former clients, colleagues, and even family members accused her of verbal and sexual harassment, intimidating clients and potential job candidates, and pushing professional boundaries excessively.\n\nThe complaints came from all directions. \"I have been a victim of her sexual harassment and manipulative abuse for years,\" a former client told the Wall Street Journal in May 2020. \"I have seen her ruthlessly exploit people for her own gain,\" a former colleague said in October.\n\nFisher vehemently denied all allegations, but the damage had been done. She was eventually forced to resign from her firm and has since remained out of the public eye.\n\nThe story of Fisher's meteoric rise and dramatic downfall highlights the importance of establishing clear codes of conduct and policies to ensure employee and client safety. It also sheds light on the harsh realities of the competitive world of Wall Street headhunting and the consequences of unchecked power.\n\nA Star is Born\n\nFisher was born in Colorado in 1992. She grew up in a wealthy family and attended a prestigious private school. She demonstrated a natural talent for networking and people skills early on, a trait she would later rely heavily upon in her career.\n\nIn 2013, Fisher graduated from college and immediately launched her career in Wall Street recruiting. She quickly gained the attention of industry leaders and, by 2015, had landed a senior executive recruiter position at a top headhunting firm.\n\nAt the time, Fisher was just 23 years old. Her youth and relative inexperience were not viewed as disadvantages. Instead, they were seen as positive assets, giving her a competitive edge over older, more experienced rivals.\n\nA Rapidly Unraveling Scandal\n\nFisher's success began to unravel in April 2020 when an anonymous blog post made a series of allegations against her. The post accused Fisher of sexual harassment, intimidation tactics, and personal humiliation of clients and job candidates.\n\nThe post quickly went viral, and soon former clients and colleagues were coming forward with their own stories of mistreatment. In May 2020, a former client went public with his allegations, telling the Wall Street Journal that Fisher had sexually harassed him for years.\n\nThe accusations sparked an investigation into Fisher's behavior, and she was eventually forced to resign from her firm in August. However, the fallout from her scandal continued. In October, a former colleague publicly accused Fisher of creating a hostile work environment, and in December 2020, Fisher's own family members accused her of financial and emotional abuse.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nSince her resignation in August, Fisher has kept a low profile. The exact location of her current residence is unknown. Her LinkedIn profile has been deleted, and she has yet to make a statement on the allegations.\n\nStill, Fisher's rapid ascent and dramatic downfall serve as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of having clear codes of conduct and policies in place to ensure employee and client safety.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "In a world getting used to extreme weather, 2023 is starting out more bonkers than ever and meteorologists are saying it\u2019s natural weather weirdness with a bit of help from human-caused climate change.\n\nMuch of what\u2019s causing problems worldwide is coming out of a roiling Pacific Ocean, transported by a wavy jet stream, experts said.\n\nAt least one highway in drought-mired California looked more like a river because of torrential rain from what is technically called an atmospheric river of moisture. New Year\u2019s brought shirtsleeve weather to the U.S. East and record high temperatures to Europe as the Northern Hemisphere on Wednesday was more than 2.6 degrees (1.4 degrees Celsius) hotter than the late 20th century average. And this is after frigid air escaped the Arctic to create a Christmas mess for much of the United States.\n\n\u201cAll the ingredients are in place for two weeks of wild weather especially in the Western U.S.,\u201d private meteorologist Ryan Maue said in an email.\n\nMaue said the big driver is a three-year La Nina\u2014natural temporary cooling of the equatorial Pacific Ocean that alters world weather patterns\u2014that just won\u2019t quit. It is creating literal waves in the weather systems that ripple across the globe. And on certain parts of the waves are storms where the atmospheric pressure drops low and quickly, called bomb cyclones, that are quite wet, and they travel on atmospheric waves that transport the weather called the jet stream.\n\nRead more: \u2018Bomb Cyclone\u2019 and Other Weird Weather Words for Our Climate Change Era\n\nThe jet stream now is unusually wavy, said Maue and Woodwell Climate Research Center climate scientist Jennifer Francis. The storms dip over the warm subtropics \u201cand create a conveyor belt of of moisture to strafe the West Coast of the U.S,\u201d Maue said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d describe the jet stream and bomb cyclones as a runaway Pacific freight train loaded with moisture,\u201d said Maue, former chief scientist of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the Trump administration. \u201cClimate change adds more fuel to the locomotive engine.\u201d\n\nMore than 5 inches of rain fell on Saturday in the Sacramento area and California braced for bigger storms Wednesday and Thursday. As of Wednesday, snowpack was third highest in 40 years, more than 170% of normal.\n\nIn addition to La Nina, a different natural temporary weather event called the Madden-Julian Oscillation enhances storms in the western Pacific, Maue said.\n\nFrancis points to a \u201cblob\u201d of warm sea water off the Aleutian Islands, a phenomena that is happening more often, and a \u2018\u2019crazy warm\u201d Arctic\u2014Wednesday it was 5.8 degrees (3.2 degrees Celsius) warmer than the 1979-2000 average\u2014as part of what\u2019s juicing up the Pacific.\n\nAnd with a wavier than normal jet stream, extremes of all kinds go up and down and around the planet, Francis said.\n\n\u201cYou can think of it like a jump rope. When you start to flick it at one end, that ripple goes through the whole jump rope eventually,\u201d Francis said Wednesday. \u201cAnd so it could be that the waving as such, being perhaps driven in the Pacific, could be accentuating it also over Europe.\u201d\n\nA weather station in Delemont, Switzerland, on the French border, smashed its January record with an average daily temperature of 18.1 degrees Celsius (nearly 65 Fahrenheit) on the first day of the year. In Bucharest, Romania, on Tuesday it broke a January record at 17.2 degrees Celsius (63 degrees Fahrenheit) and it was 17.9 degrees Celsius (64.2 Fahrenheit) in the Russian Republic of Dagestan, according to extreme weather tracker Maximiliano Herrera.\n\nSwiss weather service MeteoSuisse quipped on its blog: \u201c\u2026 this turn of the new year could almost make you forget that it\u2019s the height of winter.\u201d\n\nThis extreme weather has \u201ca silver lining,\u201d especially with the record heat in Europe in January easing winter heating fuel crunches caused by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, said Colorado meteorologist Bob Henson of Yale Climate Connections. And California, where there\u2019s been a more than 20-year megadrought that worsens wildfires, is getting much-needed rain and snow \u2014 too much of it, actually.\n\nRoads and levees in California were washed out early in the week. Schools were closed Wednesday in the San Francisco area as more than 8,000 sandbags were given out in anticipation of extensive flooding. Flights were cancelled.\n\n\u201cExcessive rainfall over already saturated soils will result in rapid rises on creeks, streams and rivers as well as flooding in urban areas,\u201d forecasters said in a report.\n\nExcept for the impressive record heat in Europe, \u201cwhich is yet another example of the manifestation of human-induced climate change,\u201d Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini said he finds nothing too unusual.\n\nWeather is naturally extreme \u201cso the recent events we\u2019ve been seeing can occur naturally,\u201d said Weather Underground co-founder Jeff Masters now at Yale Climate Connections. \u201cBut with the disruption to global weather patterns that climate change is bringing the probability of seeing unusual weather events in any season increases.\u201d\n\nContact us at letters@time.com.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "ST. LOUIS (AP) \u2014 Unless Missouri Gov. Mike Parson grants clemency, Amber McLaughlin, 49, will become the first transgender woman executed in the U.S. She is scheduled to die by injection Tuesday for killing a former girlfriend in 2003.\n\nMcLaughlin\u2019s attorney, Larry Komp, said there are no court appeals pending.\n\nThe clemency request focuses on several issues, including McLaughlin\u2019s traumatic childhood and mental health issues, which the jury never heard in her trial. A foster parent rubbed feces in her face when she was a toddler and her adoptive father used a stun gun on her, according to the clemency petition. It says she suffers from depression and attempted suicide multiple times.\n\nThe petition also includes reports citing a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, a condition that causes anguish and other symptoms as a result of a disparity between a person\u2019s gender identity and their assigned sex at birth.\n\n\u201cWe think Amber has demonstrated incredible courage because I can tell you there\u2019s a lot of hate when it comes to that issue,\" her attorney, Larry Komp, said Monday. But, he said, McLaughlin's sexual identity is \u201cnot the main focus\u201d of the clemency request.\n\nParson's spokesperson, Kelli Jones, said the review process for the clemency request is still underway.\n\nThere is no known case of a transgender inmate being executed in the U.S. before, according to the anti-execution Death Penalty Information Center. A friend in prison says she saw McLaughlin's personality blossom during her gender transition.\n\nBefore transitioning, McLaughlin was in a relationship with girlfriend Beverly Guenther. McLaughlin would show up at the suburban St. Louis office where the 45-year-old Guenther worked, sometimes hiding inside the building, according to court records. Guenther obtained a restraining order, and police officers occasionally escorted her to her car after work.\n\nGuenther\u2019s neighbors called police the night of Nov. 20, 2003, when she failed to return home. Officers went to the office building, where they found a broken knife handle near her car and a trail of blood. A day later, McLaughlin led police to a location near the Mississippi River in St. Louis, where the body had been dumped.\n\nStory continues\n\nMcLaughlin was convicted of first-degree murder in 2006. A judge sentenced McLaughlin to death after a jury deadlocked on the sentence. A court in 2016 ordered a new sentencing hearing, but a federal appeals court panel reinstated the death penalty in 2021.\n\nOne person who knew Amber before she transitioned is Jessica Hicklin, 43, who spent 26 years in prison for a drug-related killing in western Missouri in 1995. She was 16. Because of her age when the crime occurred, she was granted release in January 2022.\n\nHicklin, 43, began transitioning while in prison and in 2016 sued the Missouri Department of Corrections, challenging a policy that prohibited hormone therapy for inmates who weren\u2019t receiving it before being incarcerated. She won the lawsuit in 2018 and became a mentor to other transgender inmates, including McLaughlin.\n\nThough imprisoned together for around a decade, Hicklin said McLaughlin was so shy they rarely interacted.

{"text": "The Sunshine State's appeal extends beyond its warm weather, as it offers a unique combination of tax advantages and a high quality of life. For decades, Americans have been flocking to Florida for its pleasant climate, and now, more and more people are discovering its benefits as a place to live, not just retire.\n\nFlorida's zero income tax rate is just the beginning, as the state also doesn't impose an estate tax, allowing residents to save a significant amount of money when they pass away. Additionally, Florida doesn't tax Social Security or other retirement income, providing an attractive option for those looking to stretch their retirement dollars.\n\nAccording to financial planners, the tax benefits can be substantial, with some estimating tens of thousands of dollars in savings over a lifetime. The U.S. Census Bureau has reported a significant increase in Florida's population, with over 3 million new residents since 2012.\n\nHowever, experts caution that moving to Florida isn't always the best option for everyone. The cost of living in Florida, especially in popular areas, can be high, and real estate prices can be expensive. It's essential to weigh the costs and benefits, considering factors such as living expenses, investment portfolios, and the potential impact on one's lifestyle.\n\nAnother consideration is the potential difficulty of establishing a professional network in a new state. Breaking into an established local business community can be challenging, especially for those relocating from out of state.\n\nAdditionally, Florida's reliance on sales taxes to fund public services, such as schools and infrastructure, can make it harder to access certain government services. While the state offers some property tax breaks, it's crucial to consider the overall financial implications of relocating to Florida.\n\nDespite these potential drawbacks, for some, the benefits of living in Florida may outweigh the drawbacks. The state's warm climate, tax advantages, and high quality of life make it an attractive option for those looking to escape harsh winters or simply enjoy a more relaxed pace of life. As one financial planner notes, \"It's essential to do your homework and make sure you're making the right financial decision for you.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has concluded its investigation into former Senator Richard Burr and his brother-in-law, Dane Fulmer, regarding their involvement in a now-defunct North Carolina-based hedge fund, K Street Partners. The investigation, which commenced in January 2019, centered around the pair's stock sales preceding the COVID-19 pandemic-induced market downturn. Although neither Burr nor Fulmer was charged with any wrongdoing, the SEC's inquiry was extensive, involving interviews with both men and other individuals, including politicians, business executives, and investors. The SEC ultimately determined that the stock trades were \"overwhelmingly offsetting\" and that there was no evidence of nonpublic information or material misstatements. The decision has brought relief to Burr and Fulmer, who had consistently denied any wrongdoing. However, other agencies, such as the U.S. Department of Justice and the Senate Ethics Committee, may still launch their own probes. The SEC's conclusion is particularly noteworthy given Burr's position as chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and his advocacy for pandemic-related legislation.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Survivors of a 2017 mass shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, said they find themselves frustrated, confused and angry as the Department of Justice nears its deadline to appeal the decision that found the federal government liable in the attack that killed 26 of their fellow churchgoers.\n\nCritics of the Justice Department\u2019s potential appeal, including the surviving victims, said the agency's stated arguments undermine the background check system \u2014 a cornerstone of President Joe Biden's gun policy priorities. The government's lawyers claimed during the first trial that the gunman could have purchased firearms elsewhere, even if a background check would have prevented him from legally purchasing them from a licensed gun dealer.\n\nThe government has until Jan. 9 to file its appeal, in which it could further argue that the background check system \u2014 a key defense in the United States to ensure guns are not acquired by criminals or people with a history of violence \u2014 does not work, which critics say is a common talking point of the gun lobby.\n\nThe disharmony between the Justice Department\u2019s case and the Biden administration\u2019s gun safety efforts as well as the fears and pressure that a lost appeal could damage gun safety laws are at the crux of the survivors' acrimony.\n\n\u201cIf I had an opportunity to meet President Biden, I would ask him, \u2018Why? Why are you doing all this (gun reform) and yet you\u2019re fighting it over here?\u2019\u201d said Juan \u201cGunny\u201d Macias, a survivor who was shot numerous times in the attack and viewed the president\u2019s gun safety priorities as dissonant with the potential Justice Department appeal.\n\nIn July 2021, the government was found liable for failing to provide records that could have kept Devin Kelley from acquiring the weapon he used in the shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, and it was ordered to pay the more than 80 survivors and victim family members $230 million dollars. The Justice Department has received two extensions to file its appeal brief, now due next week, and is unlikely to receive another one.\n\nInvestigators at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on Nov. 6, 2017. Jay Janner / Austin American-Statesman via AP file\n\nThe Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment, but it argued in court that if the U.S. Air Force had followed the law and the shooter was not allowed to purchase a firearm, he could have found a gun another way and committed the same act, according to court transcripts.\n\nThough it is required by federal law, the Air Force did not report the gunman's 2012 arrest and court-martial for domestic violence to the FBI. If the military branch had reported his court-martial, it would have appeared on a background check and the former airman, who died by suicide after carrying out the mass shooting, would have been prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms and ammunition.\n\nIt also did not warn others of a pattern of behavior that led to him being banned from all U.S. military bases. The Air Force was aware of death threats he made against his family, military security forces, police officers and members of his squadron, court records show.\n\nMacias, a retired Marine, was extensively injured in the shooting. He broke down in tears as he described dealing with regular hernias, lead poisoning from the bullets and the colostomy bag he now must wear that often leaks or falls off, making it difficult to travel in public and ruining \u201csimple pleasures like sitting to eat.\u201d\n\nJuan \u201cGunny\u201d Macias, a survivor, was shot numerous times in the attack. Courtesy National Trial Law\n\nHis voice betrayed a deep sense of anger when he discussed the appeal that involves more than 80 survivors and victims' family members, and the government\u2019s failure to report the gunman\u2019s violent past.\n\n\u201cThe law is there for a reason,\u201d Macias said. \u201cAnd if they would\u2019ve followed that law, if they would have done their job, this would have never happened. Twenty-six people would be alive today.\u201d\n\nJamal Alsaffar, an attorney for the victims, said that the Justice Department had backed out of mediation over the case, and he is preparing for a potential appeal that he believed could damage gun safety laws. It would also put his clients through many more months of reliving the traumatic shooting, he said.\n\n\u201cThe gun lobby can\u2019t wait until they file this appeal because then they\u2019ll say, \u2018Look, even the Biden (Department of Justice) says they don\u2019t have to follow background check laws because they don\u2019t really work,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nThe intentions of the government\u2019s lawyers may be to point out that the nation's gun control measures are fairly limited and that there are many loopholes that can be taken advantage of, said Robert Spitzer, a political science professor at the State University of New York College at Cortland, who has authored six books on gun policy. Nevertheless, gun rights supporters would likely celebrate the Justice Department\u2019s success in the case, he added.\n\nAs the Justice Department\u2019s \u201clawyers are brought in to be good lawyers, not to be good Democrats or Republicans,\u201d he said, they are likely trying to win at all costs without fully considering the political ramifications or how it will affect victims.\n\n\u201cI assume the Justice Department is taking this position because the lawyers are looking for the best legal avenues that will give them the outcome they want,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, sometimes, a good legal strategy is a poor political strategy, and this might be an example of that.\u201d\n\nHailey McNulty, who survived the shooting as a 15-year-old, seemed to think that might be the case. She was shot five times and recovered, but continues to be physically and emotionally affected after the shooting. Her mother who pushed her under a pew and attempted to protect her was shot in the head and died inches from her during the attack.\n\n\u201cI was so scared and nervous and I rolled over to try to get the attention of my mom to talk to her, and she wasn\u2019t responding,\u201d she recalled, later breaking down in tears as her grandmother spoke about taking her to the hospital. \u201cAnd then it clicked to me that she was dead.\u201d\n\nHailey McNulty at her mother Tara's grave. Her mother who pushed her under a pew and attempted to protect her was shot in the head and died inches from her during the attack. Courtesy Haily McNulty\n\nMcNulty argued that the Justice Department was cynically subverting background checks to win in court, which did not square with the Biden administration\u2019s policy efforts to protect people from gun violence.\n\n\u201cHow do they expect the citizens of the United States to abide by these laws when they see that the ones in charge don\u2019t even have to listen or abide by them themselves?\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what creates chaos. That\u2019s what creates problems like the ones we\u2019re facing.\u201d\n\nFor fear of what an appeal could mean for U.S. gun laws, a coalition of 37 gun safety organizations sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland in October about the Justice Department\u2019s intention to appeal. In the letter, they state that the federal government\u2019s \u201crefusal to accept responsibility for its failure in this case actively undermines the very gun safety laws it is required to enforce\u201d and \u201cabandons the Government\u2019s promise to keep communities safe by preventing prohibited persons from purchasing firearms.\u201d\n\nExpanded background checks and red flag laws were a cornerstone of Biden\u2019s landmark gun control legislation that passed this year after the Uvalde shooting in Texas, in which 19 elementary school students and two teachers were killed.\n\nThe White House said it could not comment on pending litigation, but it emphasized that Biden\u2019s \u201ccommitment to reducing gun violence could not be clearer.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Biden has championed stronger gun safety laws for decades, from helping to establish the gun background check system and passing an assault weapons ban during his time in the Senate, to signing the strongest gun safety legislation in 30 years at the White House this past summer,\u201d said Olivia Dalton, the White House deputy press secretary, adding that Biden intended to \u201ctake additional action to end the scourge of gun violence in America.\u201d\n\nBut those intentions mean little to McNulty, especially as the potential for an appeal no longer looms so far in the distance.\n\nWhile the government can argue that gunman could have procured the firearm elsewhere, \u201cthe problem is that he didn\u2019t have to go to extensive lengths to find the weapons he wanted,\u201d she said. \u201cHe literally walked into the store and bought them just like anybody else.\u201d", "label": "human"}
{"text": "A recent investigation by Bloomberg has uncovered a disturbing pattern of broken promises by Wall Street banks, leading to the displacement of Black homeowners in a historically African American neighborhood in Baltimore.\n\nAccording to the report, the banks had pledged $7 million in investment and lending to refurbish and stabilize properties in the Northwest Baltimore neighborhood, which had been neglected and disinvested since the civil rights era. However, the funds were never received, and the entire neighborhood, located along Bonaparte Avenue, was ravaged by poverty.\n\n\"It was supposed to be a model neighborhood, but instead it's one of Baltimore's most distressed blocks,\" said Karla Feltz, a historian and community advocate who has closely monitored the area's changing demographics.\n\nThe investigation found that JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America were among the major Wall Street banks that failed to fulfill their promises of investment, lending, and renovation. The banks had pledged a total of $7 million, which was supposed to come from their Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) funds, which are intended to support the \"stabilization and revitalization\" of low-income and minority communities.\n\nThe CRA funds are managed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC), which regulates banks and monitors the money they must reinvest in the communities they serve. However, the FDIC rarely audits banks to ensure they are fulfilling the CRA requirements, allowing them to get away with not complying with their promises.\n\nThe lack of funds has had a devastating impact on the residents of Bonaparte Avenue, with many homes being neglected and falling into disrepair. According to Bloomberg, only nine homes on the block are currently occupied, with the rest either abandoned or in poor condition.\n\n\"This is the face of inequality, and it's a harsh reminder that even when large companies make a commitment to invest in African American communities, the promises are too often empty,\" said Feltz. \"It's essential for banks and other institutions to be held accountable to their promises, because without accountability, no real change is possible.\"\n\nThe Bloomberg report notes that the plight of the Bonaparte Avenue residents is not unique. A study by PolicyLink found that one in five people living in low-income and minority neighborhoods still live in areas that have seen no or little investment. These neighborhoods are often left behind, without access to quality education, healthcare, or job opportunities.\n\n\"The tragedy of the residents of Bonaparte Avenue is emblematic of the inequality and economic injustice that still plagues America today,\" said John S. Weekes, lead author of the Bloomberg report. \"It's essential that banks and other institutions are held accountable for the promises they make, and that investments are made to support and revitalize low-income and minority communities.\"\n\nIn response to the investigation, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo have agreed to commit an additional $20 million for investment and lending in the neighborhood. The funds will be used for renovations, infrastructure improvements, and job creation.\n\n\"The additional $20 million is a critical step, but it's only the beginning,\" said Weekes. \"It's essential that banks, governments, and community-based organizations all take meaningful action to ensure that every person has access to a safe and secure home, quality education, and good job opportunities.\"", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "In the beginning of a new year, numerous individuals are eager to have their financial resources work for them by investing. However, with numerous options and strategies available, it can be overwhelming to determine where to initiate.\n\nThat's why a 30-year-old self-made millionaire, Andrea Ruiz, has some advice. She began investing in her twenties and now possesses a well-diversified portfolio, enabling her to live life according to her own terms.\n\n\"When I started investing, I had no idea where to begin,\" she says. \"It took me a considerable amount of time and effort to acquire the necessary knowledge to make informed decisions.\"\n\nFortunately, you don't need to be a financial expert to start investing. Ruiz suggests that there are four fundamental principles to follow, which will aid in building a successful portfolio.\n\n1. Recognize your risk appetite\n\nPrior to making any investment decisions, it's essential to comprehend your risk tolerance. Everyone has a unique risk tolerance, and it's crucial to consider how comfortable you are with varying levels of risk.\n\nFor instance, some individuals might be willing to take on more risk and invest in more speculative assets. Others might prefer a more conservative portfolio with lower risk and lower returns.\n\nOnce you understand your risk tolerance, you can start searching for investments that align with it.\n\n2. Diversify your portfolio\n\nWhen it comes to investing, diversification is vital. Ruiz recommends investing across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, cash, and real estate.\n\nThis will help spread out your risk, ensuring you're not putting all your resources in one basket. Additionally, it can help you capitalize on different market cycles and take advantage of various opportunities.\n\nIt's also essential to diversify within each asset class. For example, if you're investing in stocks, you might want to consider investing in different sectors and industries. This will help minimize your risk in the event one sector or industry experiences a decline.\n\n3. Establish realistic goals\n\nInvesting is not a get-rich-quick scheme. It's essential to set realistic and achievable goals that you can work toward. These goals should be specific, measurable, and time-bound.\n\nFor instance, you might have a goal of increasing your portfolio by 10% within a year. Or you might want to set a goal of saving a certain amount each month for retirement.\n\nThese goals will give you something to work toward and will help you stay focused and motivated.\n\n4. Don't overlook the long-term\n\nWhen investing, it's crucial to have an eye on the long-term. Investing can be a great way to build wealth over the long-term, but it can also be volatile in the short-term.\n\nIt's essential to remember that there will be ups and downs, and it's crucial to stay focused on the long-term. Investing is not a get-rich-quick scheme, so don't expect overnight results.\n\nBy following these four principles, you can build a successful and diversified portfolio in 2023. It's essential to conduct your own research and comprehend the investments you're making. However, with the right strategy and a little patience, you can be well on your way to building wealth.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "watch now\n\nBill Harris, former PayPal CEO and veteran entrepreneur, strode onto a Las Vegas stage in late October to declare that his latest startup would help solve Americans' broken relationship with their finances. \"People struggle with money,\" Harris told CNBC at the time. \"We're trying to bring money into the digital age, to redesign the experience so people can have better control over their money.\" related investing news 2022 didn\u2019t go as expected for bank investors. How to avoid pitfalls in the sector in 2023 But less than a month after the launch of Nirvana Money, which combined a digital bank account with a credit card, Harris abruptly shuttered the Miami-based company and laid off dozens of workers. Surging interest rates and a \"recessionary environment\" were to blame, he said. The reversal is a sign of more carnage to come for the fintech world. Many fintech companies \u2014 particularly those dealing directly with retail borrowers \u2014 will be forced to shut down or sell themselves next year as startups run out of funding, according to investors, founders and investment bankers. Others will accept funding at steep valuation haircuts or onerous terms, which extends the runway but comes with its own risks, they said. Top-tier startups that have three to four years of funding can ride out the storm, according to Point72 Ventures partner Pete Casella. Other private companies with a reasonable path to profitability will typically get funding from existing investors. The rest will begin to run out of money in 2023, he said. \"What ultimately happens is you get into a death spiral,\" Casella said. \"You can't get funded and all your best employees start jumping ship because their equity is underwater.\"\n\nThousands of startups were created after the 2008 financial crisis as investors plowed billions of dollars into private companies, encouraging founders to attempt to disrupt an entrenched and unpopular industry. In a low interest rate environment, investors sought yield beyond public companies, and traditional venture capitalists began competing with new arrivals from hedge funds, sovereign wealth and family offices.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe movement shifted into overdrive during the Covid pandemic as years of digital adoption happened in months and central banks flooded the world with money, making companies like Robinhood , Chime and Stripe familiar names with huge valuations. The frenzy peaked in 2021, when fintech companies raised more than $130 billion and minted more than 100 new unicorns, or companies with at least $1 billion in valuation. \"20% of all VC dollars went into fintech in 2021,\" said Stuart Sopp, founder and CEO of digital bank Current. \"You just can't put that much capital behind something in such a short time without crazy stuff happening.\"\n\nThe flood of money led to copycat companies getting funded anytime a successful niche was identified, from app-based checking accounts known as neobanks to buy now, pay later entrants. Companies relied on shaky metrics like user growth to raise money at eye-watering valuations, and investors who hesitated on a startup's round risked missing out as companies doubled and tripled in value within months. The thinking: Reel users in with a marketing blitz and then figure out how to make money from them later. \"We overfunded fintech, no question,\" said one founder-turned-VC who declined to be identified speaking candidly. \"We don't need 150 different neobanks, we don't need 10 different banking-as-a-service providers. And I've invested in both\" categories, he said.\n\nOne assumption\n\nThe first cracks began to appear in September 2021, when the shares of PayPal, Block and other public fintechs began a long decline. At their peak, the two companies were worth more than the vast majority of financial incumbents. PayPal's market capitalization was second only to that of JPMorgan Chase . The specter of higher interest rates and the end of a decade-plus-long era of cheap money was enough to deflate their stocks. Many private companies created in recent years, especially those lending money to consumers and small businesses, had one central assumption: low interest rates forever, according to TSVC partner Spencer Greene. That assumption met the Federal Reserve's most aggressive rate-hiking cycle in decades this year. \"Most fintechs have been losing money for their entire existence, but with the promise of 'We're going to pull it off and become profitable,'\" Greene said. \"That's the standard startup model; it was true for Tesla and Amazon . But many of them will never be profitable because they were based on faulty assumptions.\" Even companies that previously raised large amounts of money are struggling now if they are deemed unlikely to become profitable, said Greene. \"We saw a company that raised $20 million that couldn't even get a $300,000 bridge loan because their investors told them `We are no longer investing a dime.'\" Greene said. \"It was unbelievable.\"\n\nLayoffs, down rounds\n\nAll along the private company life cycle, from embryonic startups to pre-IPO companies, the market has reset lower by at least 30% to 50%, according to investors. That follows the decline in public company shares and a few notable private examples, like the 85% discount that Swedish fintech lender Klarna took in a July fundraising. Now, as the investment community exhibits a newfound discipline and \"tourist\" investors are flushed out, the emphasis is on companies that can demonstrate a clear path toward profitability. That is in addition to the previous requirements of high growth in a large addressable market and software-like gross margins, according to veteran fintech investment banker Tommaso Zanobini of Moelis . \"The real test is, does the company have a trajectory where their cash flow needs are shrinking that gets you there in six or nine months?\" Zanobini said. \"It's not, trust me, we'll be there in a year.\" As a result, startups are laying off workers and pulling back on marketing to extend their runway. Many founders are holding out hope that the funding environment improves next year, although that is looking increasingly unlikely.\n\nNeobanks under fire\n\nAs the economy slows further into an expected recession, companies that lend to consumers and small businesses will suffer significantly higher losses for the first time. Even profitable legacy players like Goldman Sachs couldn't stomach the losses required to create a scaled digital player, pulling back on its fintech ambitions. \"If loss ratios are increasing in a rate increasing environment on the industry side, it's really dangerous because your economics on loans can get really out of whack,\" said Justin Overdorff of Lightspeed Venture Partners. Now, investors and founders are playing a game of trying to determine who will survive the coming downturn. Direct-to-consumer fintechs are generally in the weakest position, several venture investors said. \"There's a high correlation between companies that had bad unit economics and consumer businesses that got very large and very famous,\" said Point72's Casella.\n\nMany of the country's neobanks \"are just not going to survive,\" said Pegah Ebrahimi, managing partner of FPV Ventures and a former Morgan Stanley executive. \"Everyone thought of them as new banks that would have tech multiples, but they are still banks at the end of the day.\" Beyond neobanks, most companies that raised money in 2020 and 2021 at nosebleed valuations of 20 to 50 times revenue are in a predicament, according to Oded Zehavi, CEO of Mesh Payments. Even if a company like that doubles revenue from its last round, it will likely have to raise fresh funds at a deep discount, which can be \"devastating\" for a startup, he said. \"The boom led to some really surreal investments with valuations that cannot be justified, maybe ever,\" Zehavi said. \"All of these companies across the world are going to struggle, and they will need to be acquired or shut down in 2023.\"\n\nAs in previous down cycles, however, there is opportunity. Stronger players will snap up weaker ones through acquisition and emerge from the downturn in a stronger position, where they will enjoy less competition and lower costs for talent and expenses, including marketing. \"The competitive landscape shifts the most during periods of fear, uncertainty and doubt,\" said Kelly Rodriques, CEO of Forge, a trading venue for private company stock. \"This is when the bold and the well capitalized will gain.\" While sellers of private shares have generally been willing to accept bigger valuation discounts as the year went on, the bid-ask spread is still too wide, with many buyers holding out for lower prices, Rodriques said. The logjam could break next year as sellers become more realistic about pricing, he said.\n\nBill Harris, co-founder and CEO of Personal Capital Source: Personal Capital.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The concept of \"pension\" is becoming increasingly important for many people due to the rising life expectancy and the blurring of pension schemes in both public and private sectors. For many, this responsibility of pension investments brings great concerns.\n\nIn a time where markets are pushing boundaries, it is crucial to view pension savings as an investment. Most people understand that saving for their pension is a necessity, but they do not fully comprehend why it is so important. And just like with any other investment, it comes with significant risks.\n\nThis blog post will discuss the risks of pension investments and why it is unavoidable, regardless of the risk. Let us first understand the difference between risk aversion and risk-taking investments.\n\nRisk-taking investments are situations where potential returns are higher than the risks. It is a kind of chance to gain much more profit in a relatively short period than in situations where the risk is lower. When it comes to pension investments, you want to choose an investment strategy that offers a good balance between return and risk.\n\nA good pension investment strategy has a lot of risk aversion. This means that you are looking for investments with low risks and lower expected returns instead of speculating on the chance to gain a much higher profit.\n\nThere are many different types of investments that offer a good balance between return and risk. For example, if you are a conservative investor, you could choose bonds or government bonds instead of stocks. If you are a more risk-taking investor, you could choose bonds with a higher interest rate or an actively managed fund.\n\nEven if you are a stockholder, it can be beneficial to diversify your investment portfolio so that you are exposed to different sectors, industries, and regions. By diversifying your investments, you can reduce your risks by minimizing short-term volatility.\n\nInvestments are also necessary because they provide the ability to increase your purchasing power. When interest rates are low, more opportunities arise for investment. More investors gain access to lower costs, resulting in potential returns. Additionally, investments can help combat inflation, allowing your purchasing power to increase during your retirement.\n\nFinally, but no less importantly, the importance of pension investments lies in building a financial cushion and providing financial security.

REUTERS/Cesar Olmedo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASUNCION, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Paraguay would cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan and open relations with China if the opposition wins the election in April, its presidential candidate Efrain Alegre told Reuters, hoping to boost soy and beef exports that are its main economic engines.\n\nThe ruling party candidate, meanwhile, told Reuters he would maintain ties with Taiwan, a self-governed island that China considers one of its provinces and not a county, making the geopolitical question a center-piece of the election race.\n\nParaguay is one of only 14 nations globally that retains diplomatic ties with Taiwan and the only South American country to do so. China has convinced a number of the island's allies to shift allegiance in recent years, the last being Nicaragua.\n\nAlegre, candidate of a broad coalition that will seek to defeat the conservative ruling Colorado Party, said Paraguay should establish relations with China to open access to its huge soy and beef markets, long a demand of farmers in the country.\n\n\"Paraguay must have relations with China,\" Alegre said in a recent interview after being named presidential candidate.\n\n\"Our interests in livestock and grain sectors are currently suffering a major loss,\" he added. \"We hold this critical position towards relations with Taiwan because we don't think we get enough back from this relationship.\"\n\nSantiago Pena, the Colorado Party candidate, said Paraguay's over six decades of ties with Taiwan would remain intact if he won the April 30 vote.\n\n\"I do not see any change in that sense,\" Pena told Reuters. \"I will defend the historical relationship with Taiwan.\"\n\nNeither the political parties nor independent consultancies have released opinion polls on the elections, but some analysts predict a close result between Pena and Alegre. There are other small parties running in the single-round election.\n\nTaiwan's foreign ministry told Reuters that it was paying close attention to Paraguay's upcoming election and was seeking to strengthen ties with candidates on all sides.\n\n\"Our embassy is actively strengthening contact and communication with candidates from different political parties to win support for the Taiwan-Paraguay friendship,\" the ministry said in a statement.\n\nThe democratically-ruled island strongly rejects China's sovereignty claims, which have grown in recent years with Beijing ramping up diplomatic, military and economic pressure.\n\nChina says the island's allies remain with Taipei only due to pressure from Washington and so-called \"dollar diplomacy\".\n\nPRESSURE FROM FARMERS\n\nParaguay's Taiwan ties have been under the pressure in recent years, especially from the country's beef producers and farmers, who see the relationship as an obstacle to gaining access to the world's largest market for their products.\n\n\"We make a sacrifice for the political support given to Taiwan and on balance, we consider that we receive very little in compensation,\" Pedro Galli, president of the Rural Association of Paraguay (ARP), told Reuters.\n\nParaguayan imports from China totaled $4 billion in 2021, while exports stood at just $30 million. Paraguay had a trade surplus with Taiwan that year of $118 million.\n\nThe ARP, the country's largest cattle farming chamber, has been sounding out possible support for China among candidates since December primaries in a series of political meetings. Paraguay produces around 300,000 tonnes of beef a year.\n\n\"We will be measuring the temperature,\" added Galli.\n\nParaguay is a top 10 global beef exporter and the fourth largest soybean exporter, its main cash crop. Soybean production is about 10 million tonnes per year and with its derivatives, it generates more than $2 billion in foreign currency.\n\nHector Cristaldo, president of the Union of Production Guilds, the main soybean chamber, said the country was currently locked out of China, which he said made up some two-thirds of the global market.\n\n\"Today it is practically impossible to sell products to that huge market,\" he said.\n\n\"What we produce is enough for a neighborhood in a city in China, but what interests (Beijing) is us breaking ties with Taiwan. That is the dilemma that Paraguay has and that our authorities have to resolve.\"\n\n(This story has been refiled to remove alerts from the text)\n\nReporting by Daniela Desantis; Additional reporting by Sarah Wu; Editing by Adam Jourdan and Marguerita Choy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Dec 29 (Reuters) - The Securities Commission of the Bahamas said on Thursday that it is holding FTX assets worth $3.5 billion based on market pricing at the time of transfer on a temporary basis to deliver them to customers and creditors who own them.\n\nThe digital assets of FTX's Bahamas unit were transferred to digital wallets under the exclusive control of the commission in November soon after the company and its hedge fund Alameda Research and dozens of affiliates filed for U.S. bankruptcy.\n\nUpon completion of the transfer, FTX founders Sam Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang no longer had access to the tokens that were transferred or frozen, the executive director of the commission, Christina Rolle, said in an affidavit filed with the Bahamas Supreme Court.\n\n\"All transferred assets were and remain under the sole control of the commission,\" Rolle said.\n\nLawyers for crypto exchange FTX earlier this month opposed a demand for internal records from its Bahamian business, saying they \"do not trust\" the Bahamian government with data that could be used to siphon off assets from the bankrupt company.\n\nThe authorities in the Bahamas, where the company had its headquarters, appointed liquidators to wind down FTX's international trading business soon after the company announced bankruptcy.\n\nThe sheer size of the asset seizure sends mixed signals to FTX customers, according to Deborah Kovsky-Apap, a bankruptcy attorney who is not involved in the case.

{"text": "See Full Image Gallery >>\n\n\n\nPros: Exceptional powertrains, including the hybrid and Lightning; unique and game-changing tech; well-balanced driving dynamics; Raptor!\n\nCons: Interior design is a bit ugly; the Ram rides better\n\nAs you can see from the rather \u201cyeah, so what?\u201d collection of cons above, it\u2019s safe to say that we think that buying a 2023 Ford F-150 would be a decent idea. We might prefer driving the Ram 1500 or sitting in the Chevy Silverado\u2019s stylish new interior, but when it comes to those things that make a truck a truck, the F-150 is quite simply exceptional.\n\nIt really comes down to two big-ticket areas: engines and technology. First, its smooth and efficient turbocharged V6 \u201cEcoBoost\u201d engines provide impressive refinement and power that makes anything with a V8 feel a bit old fashioned. Of course, the PowerBoost Hybrid puts even those to shame with the sort of no-compromise combo of power and efficiency that can really only be beat by the also-exceptional F-150 Lightning electric truck we review separately.\n\nSecond, when we talk about \u201ctechnology\u201d we\u2019re not talking about the usual discussion of touchscreens and Apple CarPlay. Nope, the F-150 has game-changing tech for actual truck purposes. We named its Pro Power on-board generator options our Technology of the Year for 2021, and then its Onboard Scales and Smart Hitch hauling and towing features our Technology of the Year for 2022. We describe them at the above links and below.\n\nFor everything else that makes a truck a truck, including a variety of off-roading options topped off by the wild new Raptor R, the F-150 delivers. Try out the Ram and GM trucks to be sure, but definitely don\u2019t ignore this Ford.\n\nInterior & Technology | Passenger & Cargo Space | Performance & Fuel Economy\n\nWhat it's like to drive | Pricing & Trim Levels | Crash Ratings & Safety Features\n\nWhat's new for 2023?\n\nBesides massively jacked up prices, there\u2019s another pair of off-road-oriented F-150 models for 2023. First, there\u2019s the Rattler, a package that adds to the base XL trim level a variety of FX4 package upgrades: skid plates, all-terrain tires, off-road shocks, a locking diff and hill descent control. Outside you can tell it apart from the unique combination of XL black plastic grille and bumpers paired with special badging and the rugged wheel/tire combo. Second, there\u2019s the Raptor R, which adds a supercharged V8 to more or less the same Raptor chassis upgrades. You can read all about it in our Raptor R first drive review. There\u2019s also the F-150 Heritage Edition that pays tribute to the marque\u2019s history of distinctive two-tone color schemes. They\u2019re pretty snazzy.\n\nStory continues\n\n2022 Ford F-150 Platinum Interior\n\nWhat are the F-150 interior and in-car technology like?\n\nFord performed major surgery on the F-150's dash two years ago in order to swallow what is essentially a small television in top trim levels. The result is an awfully monolithic center stack that's less visually appealing than what you'd get in the Ram 1500 and radically revised Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra. That's especially true when talking about the upper trim levels, but at least those including the Platinum (pictured top) make up for it with buttery leather, open-pore wood trim and nicely textured metal-look trim. That said, even the lower XLT trim has high-quality materials and the novel inclusion of a trim piece embossed with a map of Detroit (pictured below, bottom left)\n\nAs for that big 12-inch screen, we can't say it adds much to the Sync 4 interface beyond simply being bigger than the 8-inch standard unit. That's certainly still a benefit (who wants a smaller screen?), but unlike the Ram portrait-style upgrade and GM\u2019s widescreen unit (plus the Lightning\u2019s portrait-style Sync 4A screen), the larger screen doesn't maximize its extra acreage with rearranged or extra-large icons that greatly improve functionality. It's also a further reach than what you'll find in the Ram, regardless of screen size. On the other hand, the available all-digital instrument panel is colorful and crisp, and there's no faulting the ample infotainment feature content.\n\nWe extensively reviewed the six-passenger cabin of a F-250 SuperCrew whose seating is essentially shared with the '22 F-150, including its front middle seat and fold-down console. Five-passenger F-150s, meanwhile, offer a center console with a unique armrest lid that unfolds forward to become a flat surface to place a laptop, paperwork or road-side picnic. To make this origami possible, the shifter uniquely motors forward into a recess, though only when parked (pictured below). We're curious to know how much owners have actually utilized and appreciated this functionality. Ford also greatly increased the steering wheel's tilt and telescoping travel, making for an impressively more comfortable, SUV-like driving position.\n\nHow big is the F-150?\n\nThe various full-size trucks are so big that differences among them are effectively moot. An inch or two here and there won't make a difference outside. As before, you get a choice of regular, SuperCab (extended) and SuperCrew cabs with the latter two offering six-passenger or five-passenger seating arrangements. The SuperCab continues to have clamshell doors rather than the front-hinged ones offered by Ram and GM. Its back seat space continues to be on the cramped side, but that's common for the segment. So too is the vast amount of rear seat space in the SuperCrew.\n\nThis is also as good a place as any to mention the F-150's unique bed elements. One is familiar: the tailgate's pop-out assist step that makes repeatedly climbing up and down out of the bed a game-changing quick-and-easy process (pictured above right). The second is a more recent advancement: the ProPower On Board electrical system that allows the F-150 to function as mobile generator and power station. A 2.0-kilowatt system is optional with the 2.7-, 5.0- and 3.5-liter gas engines, while the Power Boost hybrid offers a choice of standard 2.4-kW or optional 7.2-kW outputs. The lower-powered systems have a pair of 120-volt 20-amp outlets (pictured below left), while the 7.2-kW system adds two more 120-volt outlets plus a 240-volt 30-amp outlet (pictured below right). And finally, the third is the available Onboard Scales and Smart Hitch that make hauling and towing so much easier and safer.\n\nWhat are the F-150 fuel economy and performance specs?\n\nSettle in, folks, this is going to take a while. The F-150 is back up to seven engine options \u2013 the diesel engine from a few years back may still be gone, but the Raptor R adds a supercharged V8. Oh, and we\u2019re not even counting the Lightning, which we review separately.\n\nEvery F-150 has a 10-speed automatic and most come standard with rear-wheel drive. The basic four-wheel-drive system has an open diff at the rear, while the upgrade one has an electronic locking rear diff.\n\nThe lineup starts with a 3.3-liter naturally aspirated V6 good for 290 horsepower and 265 pound-feet of torque. Fuel economy is a 21 mpg combined with rear-wheel drive, and 20 mpg combined with four-wheel-drive.\n\nNext up is the first of two \"EcoBoost\" engines, which is just fancy Ford talk for \"turbocharged.\" The 2.7-liter twin-turbo V6 produces 325 hp and 400 lb-ft of torque, while returning 21 or 22 mpg combined depending on different factors. Don't be surprised if your real-world fuel economy is much lower than that, however.\n\nThere's still a good-old V8 available: Ford's 5.0-liter \"Coyote\" good for 400 hp and 410 lb-ft. Despite its output and cylinder count, it still manages between 18 and 20 mpg combined in regular models, or 17 mpg with the Tremor. Not bad.\n\nWe'd still choose the silky-smooth 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6, though, which pumps out 400 hp and 500 lb-ft of torque. Fuel economy is between 19 and 21 mpg combined depending on drivetrain in regular models, or 18 with the Tremor\n\nThe Ford Raptor, meanwhile, now offers a choice in engine. The \u201cbase\u201d choice is a upgraded version of that 3.5-liter EcoBoost good for 450 hp and 510 lb-ft. Fuel economy stands at 15 or 16 mpg combined depending on equipment. The new Raptor R boasts a supercharged 5.2-liter V8 from the Mustang Shelby GT500. It produces 700 hp and 640 lb-ft of torque. Fuel economy is only 12 mpg combined, which is just as terrible as the Ram TRX, but hey, it swills regular versus premium so it\u2019ll save you something like $1,000 every year in gas. Value!\n\nOf course, if you\u2019re really interested in saving gas, there's the sensational PowerBoost hybrid powertrain. Its combination of 3.5-liter twin-turbo V6 and electric motor integrated into the transmission produces 430 hp and 570 lb-ft. It returns 25 mpg with 2WD and 23 mpg with 4WD. That difference may not seem great, but when talking trucks, small differences in MPG figures can actually equate into big savings. In general, though, every version of the 2023 F-150 is impressively efficient for a full-size truck. Well, except the Raptor R.\n\n\n\nSee Full Image Gallery >>\n\nWhat's the F-150 like to drive?\n\nThere are so many versions of the F-150, especially in regard to engine choice, that how it drives very much depends. All share one common element: they are shockingly smooth, refined and even responsive to drive. A Platinum test truck and its adaptive steering system was almost SUV-like in the way it moved down the road: the steering was quicker and more responsive than before, the ride smoother, and there was the general feeling of the truck being smaller than it was. The refinement drop off to a much cheaper XLT test truck wasn't that big, either. For those who need a pickup that can also accommodate the whole family on a road trip, the F-150 is no longer the compromise it once was. The Ram 1500 pulls off a similar trick, and indeed, the gap between the two trucks has narrowed substantially \u2013 and has possibly disappeared.\n\nAs for those powertrains, we won't mince words: The F-150 PowerBoost is the most impressive pickup for everyday duty we've tested. Its massive output, refined power delivery and superior fuel economy make it the most appealing powertrain option. It also hides its hybridness well \u2013 there's no fussy CVT, awkward brake feel or weird electric noises. It feels totally normal. It also makes the otherwise potent 5.0-liter V8 feel like an old dog, especially in its responsiveness around town. The two EcoBoost turbocharged V6's are better in this regard, and continue to impress with their buttery smooth power delivery. The bigger 3.5-liter's substantial output is even more impressive in light of how relatively fuel efficient it remains.\n\nNote that we review the F-150 Lightning separately.\n\nWhat other Ford F-150 reviews can I read?\n\nWe drive as many variations of the new F-150 as we can, but come away most impressed by the PowerBoost hybrid.\n\n2021 F-150 Limited PowerBoost\n\nWe dispatched engineer and off-road expert Dan Edmunds to the California desert to give us the fullest look at the new Raptor you'll be able to find.\n\nDetailing what adding a supercharged Shelby V8 does to the Raptor (it does not make it slow)\n\nDetails about the off-road-oriented Tremor. It's more a slow-and-steady rock crawler than the Raptor.\n\nRead our detailed review of the Lightning, which is the wildly impressive electric F-150.\n\n\n\nSee Full Image Gallery >>\n\nJoin Editor Byron Hurd for a video tour of the F-150's new interior features.\n\nFord didn't draw attention to them, but there are many subtle-but-significant changes.\n\nWhat is the 2023 F-150 price?\n\nPrices are up significantly throughout the F-150 lineup, but the amount differs by trim level. The Lariat has gone up by nearly $8,000, while the XLT and Platinum are only about $1,500 more. Most others are closer to the higher end of that range. All prices below include the hefty destination charge of $1,895.\n\nAll prices below are the cheapest price each trim level is available. You can find a more comprehensive rundown of each trim level, including added standard features and the prices of various cab, bed and drivetrain combinations here at Autoblog.\n\nXL: $36,490\n\nXLT: $42,655\n\nLariat: $59,375\n\nTremor: $63,005 (pictured below left)\n\nKing Ranch: $64,900\n\nPlatinum: $66,590\n\nRaptor: $78,670\n\nLimited: $84,910 (pictured below right)\n\nRaptor R: $109,245\n\n2021 F-150 Limited PowerBoost\n\nWhat are the F-150 safety ratings and driver assistance features?\n\nThe base XL may not come standard with any driver assist systems, but in general, they are more widely available on the F-150 than on GM or Ram's trucks. Starting with the XLT, the F-150 comes standard with forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane keeping assist, blind-spot and rear cross-traffic warning and rear parking sensors. It's also eligible, depending on package or trim level, for the Co-Pilot360 Assist system that adds adaptive cruise control (ACC) with stop-and-go capability, lane-centering steering assist, evasive steering system and speed-sign recognition. The Blue Cruise advanced handsfree driving system can be added to all but the XL and XLT. The standard rearview camera also includes Dynamic Hitch Assist, which provides a sight line to help you hitch up without a spotter (or punching a hole in the bumper).\n\nIn government crash tests, every cab style received a perfect five stars for overall, frontal and side crash protection. Insurance Institute for Highway Safety named it a Top Safety Pick for its performance in all relative crash tests and for its crash-prevention technologies. Its headlight ratings were rated Poor, Acceptable and Good depending on trim level and equipment.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nYou Might Also Like", "label": "human"}

Donating eggs might even cause cancer, though scientists say it will take decades to determine for sure whether there's a link.\n\nAnd of course, since children born from donated eggs will share common DNA with their donor, women who donate should also be aware that the children they help create may someday want to reach out and make contact.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Call to Select readers: Have you found a mistake on your credit report that's affected your credit score or not been able to get a credit card or secure a loan because of a poor credit score? Reach out to trina.paul@nbcuni.com to share your story. Terms apply to American Express benefits and offers. Visit americanexpress.com to learn more. Lenders use credit scores to determine a borrower's creditworthiness, or the likelihood they will be able to pay back their loan on time and in full. This three digit number between 300 to 850 is calculated based on the information in your credit report. Two scoring models \u2014 FICO and VantageScore \u2014 are the most widely used, although FICO tends to be the more popular choice among lenders. Whenever you apply for a line of credit, a lender will take a look at your credit score to decide whether to extend a loan to you and determine what terms are appropriate. Having a good credit score can end up saving you hundreds or even thousands of dollars since it also determines the interest rate you'll get on a mortgage or the APR you'll have on a new credit card. Below, Select takes a closer look at what having a credit score of 800 really means for consumers, and how it affects the types of credit you would have access to.\n\nSubscribe to the Select Newsletter! Our best selections in your inbox. Shopping recommendations that help upgrade your life, delivered weekly. Sign-up here.\n\nWhat it means to have a credit score of 800\n\nA credit score of 800 means you have an exceptional credit score, according to Experian. According to a report by FICO, only 23% of the scorable population has a credit score of 800 or above. FICO considers five factors in the calculation of your credit score: Payment history (35%) : Make sure your payments are made on time and in full\n\n: Make sure your payments are made on time and in full Amounts owed (30%) : Your credit utilization ratio \u2014 the ratio of the amount of credit you use to the amount you've been extended \u2014 should be low\n\n: Your credit utilization ratio \u2014 the ratio of the amount of credit you use to the amount you've been extended \u2014 should be low Length of credit history (15%) : You'll benefit from having a longer credit history\n\n: You'll benefit from having a longer credit history Credit mix (10%) : Aim to have several different types of credit, whether it's installment loans, credit cards or a mortgage\n\n: Aim to have several different types of credit, whether it's installment loans, credit cards or a mortgage New inquiries (10%): Don't apply for too many lines of credit in a short period of time If you have a credit score of 800, it probably means you have a long credit history, have been making payments on time and keep a low credit utilization ratio. All this information shows lenders that you're likely to make good on your loan. According to a 2021 survey conducted by LendingTree, nearly all people with credit scores of 800 or above made their payments on time and in full \u2014 they also tend to have a low average credit utilization ratio of 5.7% and have old active accounts, with the average being at least 27 years. That said, you don't necessarily need to have a perfect credit score in order to get favorable terms on loans or low APRs on credit cards, as only a very small percentage of people have a perfect credit score. A recent FICO report showed that in April 2019, just 1.6% of the U.S. scorable population had a FICO score of 850 \u2014 it's typically unnecessary to aim for a credit score above 800. Generally, the rule of thumb is you'll need to have a credit score above 760 in order to receive the best terms on loans and/or mortgages. In other words, having a credit score of 800 puts you within the top credit score range and will help you qualify for the best terms, whether it's for a mortgage or a personal loan.\n\nBest credit cards if your credit score is 800\n\nHaving a credit score of 800 gives you access to some of the best credit cards on the market, which typically have a lower APR, offer more rewards opportunities, include more perks and have better welcome bonuses. The Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card is a popular choice for consumers who want a credit card with a generous welcome bonus but don't need a luxury card. Chase Sapphire Preferred cardholders can earn 60,000 bonus points spending $4,000 within the first three months of account opening.

{"text": "A novel weight management agent, designated as LIPO-6, has recently received regulatory approval in the United States and is now accessible to individuals seeking to optimize their body composition. This prescription-only medication operates by selectively targeting and disrupting adipose tissue, thereby potentially reducing stored fat by up to 25%.\n\nPreliminary data suggests that LIPO-6 is yielding promising results, with many users reporting significant improvements in their weight loss endeavors. However, its availability is currently limited due to its high cost and requirement for a medical professional's prescription. As such, it may not be a feasible solution for everyone, particularly those with financial constraints.\n\nTo achieve optimal efficacy, users must commit to a minimum three-month treatment period, allowing their bodies to adapt to the medication. It is essential for individuals to be prepared and willing to maintain a long-term treatment regimen before initiating therapy.\n\nAlthough LIPO-6 is currently only available in the United States on a limited basis, its potential widespread availability in the near future could make it a game-changer in the weight management industry. Its success could also have far-reaching implications for the healthcare sector as a whole, potentially reducing the financial burden and time commitment associated with traditional weight loss methods.\n\nBy providing a more efficient and effective solution, LIPO-6 could revolutionize the way people approach weight loss, potentially leading to significant cost savings and a more streamlined approach to healthcare.

{"text": "The colossal bonanza of $940 million in the Mega Millions lottery is the most recent instance of a series of record-breaking prizes won this year.\n\nIn March, the Mega Millions jackpot reached an unprecedented $1.6 billion. The record-breaking prize was divided among three winners \u2014 one from South Carolina, one from California, and one from New Jersey \u2014 each receiving $533 million after taxes.\n\nIn July, a $522 million Powerball jackpot was won by a 23-year-old Wisconsin man.\n\nThe $940 million Mega Millions prize, which was won Tuesday night by an anonymous player in South Carolina, is the fourth-largest jackpot in U.S. lottery history, behind the record Powerball jackpot of $1.5 billion won in 2016 and the Mega Millions prizes of $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion this year.\n\nThe impressive size of the latest Mega Millions prize is due to the game's unique \"jackpot reset\" mechanism, in which the top prize is reset to $40 million if no one wins the grand prize. When the top prize is reset, it triggers a surge in ticket sales, which helps to build the jackpot until a winner is finally crowned.\n\nThe winning numbers for Tuesday night's draw were 5, 28, 62, 65, 70, and Mega Ball 5. It's not yet known whether anyone matched all six numbers, which would mean a share of the $940 million prize.\n\nThe payout options for the jackpot were an estimated annuity of $940 million paid out over 29 years or a one-time cash option of $551.7 million. Most winners opt for the lump sum.\n\nThe estimated total prizes won Tuesday night was $1.15 billion, including second-tier prizes up to $1 million for players who matched five numbers but not the Mega Ball.\n\nSouth Carolina is the first state to allow residents to purchase lottery tickets online, a move that is credited with helping drive ticket sales and boosting the prize. The state's lottery commission said sales have been strong lately, with ticket sales skyrocketing since the jackpot surpassed the $500 million mark.\n\nIt's not just the massive jackpots that have been making headlines recently. Last month, a woman from Boise, Idaho, won the $190 million Mega Millions jackpot.\n\nAlthough the odds of winning a huge jackpot like this are extremely low \u2014 one in 302.5 million for the Mega Millions and one in 292.2 million for the Powerball \u2014 some experts suggest certain strategies can help increase the odds.\n\nOne strategy is to choose numbers that are not too popular. Since the prize is shared with anyone who matches all six numbers, the more people who choose the same numbers as you, the less you'll get of the winnings.\n\nNo matter what numbers you choose, if you want to play the lottery, experts advise that you always check the ticket to make sure you're playing the right game, set a budget, and purchase responsibly.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Many of us are familiar with the terms 'heatwave', 'blizzard', and 'tornado', but the weather lexicon has evolved over the years to include more obscure words like 'bomb cyclone' and 'haboob'.\n\nFor those living in areas affected by extreme weather, understanding the lingo is essential to staying safe. Here's a glossary of some of the newer words and their meanings.\n\nBomb Cyclone: This term describes a low-pressure storm system, or cyclone, that forms suddenly and strengthens rapidly. As the storm deepens and moves over warm ocean waters, it develops into a 'bomb cyclone', characterized by extreme winds and heavy rainfall.\n\nHaboob: This is a type of dust storm that rolls in from the Sahara desert. The term is derived from the Arabic word for 'blowing'. Haboobs occur mainly in Northern Africa but can also make an appearance in the southwestern United States, blowing in a great cloud of dust.\n\nDerecho: This is a widespread, long-lived windstorm that is composed of a series of intense, widespread straight-line wind gusts. It can cover hundreds of miles and last for several hours, causing damage in its wake.\n\nFlash Flood: A sudden flooding that occurs within six hours of heavy rainfall or a dam breach. Flash floods can cause extensive damage and it is important to be aware of where they may occur.\n\nFire Tornado: Also known as a 'fire whirl', this is a whirlwind of fire and smoke that forms when the winds that accompany a wildfire interact with the warm air created by the flames. Fire tornadoes can reach speeds of up to 150 miles per hour, posing a major danger to firefighters.\n\nSudden Stratospheric Warming: This phenomenon is characterized by a sudden jump in temperatures in the lower stratosphere, which is several miles above Earth's surface. This can lead to shifts in the jet stream, and ultimately cause changes in weather patterns on Earth.\n\nPineapple Express: This unique weather pattern involves a stream of moisture that originates near Hawaii, transporting warm, tropical air to the western coast of North America. Pineapple Express storms can cause heavy rainfall and flooding in coastal regions.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o: This weather event occurs when the waters of the equatorial Pacific become significantly warmer than usual. El Ni\u00f1o is responsible for extreme weather patterns around the world, including floods in some areas and prolonged drought in others.\n\nHeat Wave: A prolonged period of abnormally hot weather, with temperatures reaching well above the average for the area. Heat waves can lead to heat-related illness, such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke, if people aren't careful to take precautions.\n\nWind Chill: The wind chill is the effect of air temperature and wind speed on the body, and it is especially important to be aware of when temperatures dip below freezing. The lower the wind chill, the faster your body will cool, increasing your risk of hypothermia.\n\nThese and other meteorological terms are good to know if you're living in an area affected by extreme weather. Understanding the terminology and being aware of the risks associated with certain conditions is key to staying safe during dangerous weather events.", "label": "machine"}

Expect to hand over your ID\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Lionel Bonaventure/AFP via Getty Images Lionel Bonaventure/AFP via Getty Images\n\nOn websites showcasing adult-only content, verifying your age by typing your birthdate and clicking \"Go\" is deemed a simple process. But in Louisiana, that's no longer the case.\n\nAs of Jan. 1, 2023, people in Louisiana will need to present proof of their age, such as a government-issued ID, to visit and view pornographic websites like Pornhub, YouPorn and Redtube.\n\nThe controversial law, known as Act 440, requires adult websites to screen their visitors using \"reasonable age verification.\" The new law applies to any websites whose content is at least 33.3% pornographic material that is \"harmful to minors,\" according to the bill signed last June. The law doesn't specify how the 33.3% would be calculated.\n\n\"Any commercial entity that knowingly and intentionally publishes or distributes material harmful to minors on the internet from a website that contains a substantial portion of such material shall be held liable if the entity fails to perform reasonable age verification methods to verify the age of individuals attempting to access the material,\" the bill states.\n\nLouisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards' office did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment on how those without a valid driver's license or other government-issued ID can access online porn in Louisiana.\n\nRepresentatives at Pornhub, YouPorn and Redtube did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment on Louisiana's new law.\n\nConcerns grow about online privacy with the new law\n\nAs with any form of online verification in which you enter sensitive data such as your driver's license information, address, phone number or Social Security number, concerns grow as to whether your information is fully protected against security breaches and hacks.\n\nAnd with Louisiana's new law, experts argue that the verification process could potentially come with serious privacy risks for users.\n\nJason Kelley, the associate director of digital strategy at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told NPR that it's reasonable for consumers to have concerns about their privacy when it comes to sharing private information with third parties \u2014 especially when there's no guarantee that the data won't be retained.\n\n\"There is the explicit intention in the law that verifiers and websites that are using age verification should not retain [your information],\" Kelley said.\n\n\"But users don't have a lot of guarantees that it will happen and the data will be removed or deleted and [won't be] shared or used in other ways,\" he added.\n\nThe new law aims to hold adult websites accountable\n\nRep. Laurie Schlegel, the bill's sponsor, emphasized in a tweet last week before the law went into effect that age verification is \"a must to protect children from the dangers of online pornography.\"\n\n\"Online pornography is extreme and graphic and only one click away from our children. This is not your daddy's Playboy,\" Schlegel tweeted, adding that the law is \"a first step\" in holding pornography companies accountable.\n\nLouisiana is the first U.S. state to implement age verification to view adult content online. Other states, such as California, have passed similar laws restricting minors' access.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Sen. Mike Lee of Utah introduced a bill last month that would similarly require age verification, but on a national level. Additionally, he introduced a bill to change the definition of what is considered \"obscene\" under the Communications Act of 1934.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The United States is poised to make history on July 14, as the federal government has announced its plan to carry out a sentence in an Indiana prison, marking a significant milestone in the country's criminal justice system.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Prisons has announced its plan to execute Lisa Montgomery, who has been on death row since 2008 after being convicted of a heinous crime. Montgomery's execution, scheduled to take place at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana, is a sobering reminder of the gravity of the criminal justice system.\n\nMontgomery's legal team has argued that she was struggling with severe mental health issues at the time of the crime, but federal courts have rejected her appeals, and her lawyers are now calling for clemency from the President.\n\nMontgomery's case raises important questions about the intersection of identity and justice. She is the only known individual on death row with a specific characteristic, and her execution would be a somber milestone in the history of our criminal justice system.\n\nAt the heart of Montgomery's case is a personal characteristic that was denied her in the past. She was assigned a specific identity at birth and went by a certain name, but by the time she was a teenager, she was living as a different person. She was denied access to resources and was continually misidentified and misgendered throughout her life. This lack of support and acceptance was likely a contributing factor in her mental health issues, which ultimately led to the crime that put her on death row.\n\nActivists are calling for Montgomery's life to be spared, citing her personal characteristic and mental health issues as factors that should be considered in deciding whether or not to carry out her sentence.\n\nMoreover, Montgomery's legal team has argued that her execution would be unconstitutional due to her deteriorating mental health. In response, the U.S. Supreme Court has twice rejected her petitions for a stay of execution, but Montgomery's legal team is now appealing to the President for clemency.\n\nThe debate over Montgomery's execution has sparked a national discussion about capital punishment and personal characteristics. The American Civil Liberties Union has noted that there is a \"unique vulnerability\" of certain individuals to capital punishment, and they have called for Montgomery's sentence to be commuted.\n\nAt a time when the rights of certain individuals are under attack, Montgomery's case serves as a poignant reminder of the systemic discrimination that still exists. The planned execution of Montgomery, who has been on death row for more than a decade, would be an injustice that is felt around the country.\n\nThe impending execution of Lisa Montgomery has brought attention to the cruel and unusual punishment of certain individuals in the United States, and there is an urgent need to take action to ensure that her life is spared. Montgomery's story has laid bare the urgent need to reform our criminal justice system to ensure fairness and justice for all.", "label": "machine"}

The lack of progress in negotiations between workers and the company has led the unions to take more aggressive measures.\n\n\"A global contagion effect and conflict is unstoppable, and the working conditions, salary, and duration of the working day in other countries cannot be ignored,\" states a joint communiqu\u00e9 from UGT and CCOO. \"It is necessary for the Inditex group to address these global problems and implement improvements in a general and comprehensive manner for all its workers, rather than just addressing the workers in Spain.\"\n\nThe unions claim that last year saw labor disasters in numerous countries, such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Myanmar, where tens of thousands of workers suffered inhumane working conditions. Therefore, UGT and CCOO are calling on Inditex to take measures to improve the well-being of its workers worldwide.\n\nAccording to the unions, these measures include a general reduction in working hours, a significant increase in salaries, and improvements in safety, labor rights, hiring, health, and worker safety. Additionally, they demand greater corporate transparency and responsibility.\n\nThe two organizations have also reiterated their demand for collective bargaining with Inditex. According to them, this negotiation must involve workers from Spain as well as workers from all over the world. \"We call on all Inditex workers to join a global struggle to improve working conditions in all countries,\" said UGT and CCOO in their joint communiqu\u00e9.\n\n\"It's time for Inditex to address the problem of exploitation in its workforce,\" said Juan Antonio Torres, UGT secretary. \"For many years, we have been asking the company to commit to improving labor conditions in all areas where it operates. This time, we cannot afford to accept promises without fulfillment.\"\n\nThe unions have also demanded that Inditex establish a channel of dialogue with workers to create a framework for collaboration and improve its commitment to sustainable development. This petition comes after the announcement last month of the company's commitment to sustainability.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Illinois has an inadequate process for selling off land it no longer needs. It ought to do better.\n\nThe glaring shortcoming was demonstrated when the state unloaded the so-called Damen Silos at 29th Street and Damen Avenue for $6.52 million to MAT Limited Partnership, which is owned by asphalt manufacturer Michael Tadin Jr. MAT has not endeared itself to many of the residents living near its asphalt plant in McKinley Park.\n\nClearly, the 23-acre Damen property, which is right on the river, should have been part of a master plan focused on helping to redevelop the land along the Chicago River in a way most beneficial to city residents.\n\nVarious groups around the city have said they want park space, a bike path or both on the site, opponents of the sale say. And transforming the river from an old-time industrial waterway to an environmental asset for the public has long been a goal for advocates of the river. But none of that was taken into account.\n\nThe Illinois Department of Central Management Services said the state simply followed rules that said the land should be sold to the highest bidder. But Kate Eakin, vice president of the McKinley Park Development Council, told us the law requires only a sale at fair market value and it does not apply if the state is selling the land to another government, such as the city of Chicago.\n\nEditorials bug Editorials\n\nAt the very least, the state could have postponed the sale to give the city a chance to explore whether it wanted to take on the property. Opponents of the sale say the state closed its deal with MAT on Dec. 20 but didn\u2019t notify anyone until Dec. 23, when many city offices were closed either for the holidays or because of bad weather. That does not seem like the way a transparent government should operate.\n\nGenerally, accepting the highest bid makes sense. We understand there is a risk to letting state politicians feel free to sell off property without insisting on the highest return to taxpayers. And community groups that have called for a voice in other various projects have not always had a realistic understanding about what can be achieved.\n\nBut there are instances, such as in this case, in which the public benefit from a thoughtful reuse of the property would have been greater than simply getting some extra money tacked onto the sale price and having the property put back on the tax rolls.\n\nThat\u2019s why better rules are needed.\n\nIllinois residents deserve to know what will be the ultimate use of land the state is selling, said Gerald W. Adelmann, president & CEO of Openlands.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure the key stakeholders have opportunities before a sale to express their concerns,\u201d Adelmann said.\n\nAs it stands now, the state does not require any plan for a site before selling it, other than making sure no state agencies want it. The Damen site, with its historic grain silos, is one of the last remaining large plots along the Chicago River that could be used for the public.\n\nThe long-idle silos, which sit in a manufacturing district, evoke a time when Midwestern grain poured into the city and helped Chicago become the world\u2019s fastest-growing metropolis during the final decades of the 1800s. Neighbors fear any demolition of the silos might release pollutants, including asbestos, into the community.\n\nDone right, the site could be turned into a city jewel providing open space and recreation. But conservationists say no one, including the state, can produce the document in which the state notified the city of the pending sale.\n\nAs it is now, the disposition process the state follows for situations like this is in obvious need of improvement. The state, which works on behalf of the public, has to get it right next time.\n\nThe Sun-Times welcomes letters to the editor and op-eds. See our guidelines.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Amazon estimates a 30% chance of US recession in the next 6 months, internal analysis shows.\n\nThat's a more positive outlook than other estimates. Some have 100% odds of a recession in 2023.\n\nAmazon anticipates a soft landing for the US economy, according to the leaked analysis.\n\nMost economists, banks, and think-tanks expect a recession in 2023. A leaked internal document from Amazon suggests a brighter outlook, especially for the US economy.\n\nAccording to an internal macroeconomic analysis from November, obtained by Insider, the company sees a 30% chance of a US recession within the next 6 months. Based on recent data showing continued labor demand and wage increases, Amazon also anticipates a soft landing for the US economy, a term used to describe a slow-growth period that avoids a recession, the internal report said.\n\nThat's a stark contrast to many other forecasts. A Bloomberg Economics study from October said the US had a 100% chance of entering a recession within the next 12 months. A Federal Reserve staff report from November found an almost 50% odds of a US recession next year, while an October survey by the Wall Street Journal put the probability at 63%.\n\n\"The US economy, on the other hand, continues to send mixed signals and does not appear to be in a recession (yet),\" Amazon stated in its report. \"These dynamics are consistent with a soft-landing scenario (e.g. mild increase in the unemployment rate, slowdown in hiring and quits, little rise in job destruction) though the impact of continued tightening by the Federal Reserve will affect the labor market with a delay.\"\n\nThe 12-page report, put together by Amazon's science, economic, and finance teams, gives a rare look into the e-commerce giant's view of the economy. The company has more than 160 million Prime subscribers in the US who shop regularly. That's 62% of the population, according to Insider Intelligence estimates. This gives Amazon an unprecedented view of activity in the world's largest economy. Its relatively cheerful forecast suggests the US may avoid a major downturn, despite high inflation, steady interest-rate hikes, and sustained geopolitical tension.\n\nInsider asked multiple Amazon spokespeople for comment twice on Tuesday, ahead of publication. Roughly 48 hours later, after publication on December 22, one of the spokespeople provided the following statement: \"The document in question does not reflect the company's position on the economy and where it's headed. Our CFO Brian Olsavsky shared our thinking on our most recent earnings call, and our CEO shared his thoughts in a Dec. 6 interview at the Dealbook event. This document simply reflects the thoughts of some of our economists.\"\n\n'Partially shielded'\n\nAmazon sees a higher risk of a recession in other parts of the world. In the Euro Area and the UK, the odds are at 70% and the global economy is at 40%, the report said.\n\nYet, even if a recession were to come and unemployment rose, Amazon appears less concerned about the impact on its sales. The report said Amazon is \"partially shielded\" against a recession because nearly 60% of Amazon's revenue comes from wealthier customers who are \"less responsive to unemployment rate changes.\" Customers in lower-income brackets, who are more susceptible to unemployment, \"account for a small portion of overall sales,\" it added.\n\nBut given new Amazon customers who drive most of the sales growth come from lower-income areas, the report said \"a recession has the potential to impact this group's expenditure\" and the company's long-term expansion. It also cautioned that rising mortgage rates and a declining housing market could have \"spillover\" effects on household expenditures, including purchases of home goods, like furniture, home furnishings, and electronics.\n\nWhile US inflation jumped to a range of 7% to 9% this year, Amazon hasn't raised its product prices as much, the report note. In 2022, the price of products sold on Amazon climbed a little less than 6%, and that rate of increase is expected to drop below 3% in 2023, before turning negative in 2024, it said.\n\n'Downward revisions'\n\nAmazon, for its part, has significantly cut costs by shutting down multiple businesses and laying off tens of thousands of employees in recent months. In October, Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy told employees in an internal all-hands that the company would be more thoughtful about its spending going forward, as Insider previously reported.\n\n\"It's on a lot of people's minds, and of course, none of us know for sure what's gonna happen, but there are a lot of signs that point to this being a difficult and rough economy ahead of us,\" Jassy said.\n\nThe internal report from November said the US economic outlook for 2023 has \"worsened significantly\" and baseline forecasts now see growth falling below 1%. Similar downward forecasts are applied to other advanced economies, the report said, citing the October IMF World Economic Outlook for global growth that was the weakest since 2001.\n\nAll this could make it hard for Amazon to achieve growth and profitability at the same time. Historically, Amazon saw its profit margins shrink when its business grew, and vice versa, the report noted. In the current climate, where Amazon is looking to dramatically cut costs, growth could be hard to come by.\n\n\"There is a clear tradeoff between the interplay of profit seeking and growth, rendering it difficult to achieve both objectives simultaneously,\" the report said. \"As our pendulum swerves to cut costs in pursuit of higher profit margins, this may undermine our ability to grow at a faster pace in the near \u2014 or mid-term.\"\n\nDo you work at Amazon?

So if you\u2019re searching for something to watch when the cousins come over for Christmas dinner, consider these options below.\n\n(Note: I have excluded the obvious \u2013 like \u201cA Christmas Story Christmas\u201d or the new series \u201cThe Santa Clauses\u201d \u2013 because I shouldn\u2019t have to tell you that those are worth a try if you like the originals.)\n\nIf you liked \u201cBad Santa,\u201d try \u201cViolent Night\u201d\n\nDavid Harbour as a new version of a 'bad' Santa in this year's 'Violent Night.' Allen Fraser/Universal Pictures\n\nFor those in the mood for a Christmas movie not for the faint of heart, \u201cViolent Night\u201d features an ass-kicking Santa Claus who doesn\u2019t take any crap and fights off the bad guys with aplomb. While David Harbour\u2019s (\u201cStranger Things\u201d) Santa may not be as \u201cbad\u201d as Billy Bob Thornton\u2019s trash-talking Father Christmas in 2003\u2019s \u201cBad Santa,\u201d the pair could definitely drink each other under the table, each eschewing the smiley/cheesy vision of the character for something gleefully grittier.\n\nIf you liked \u201cElf\u201d or \u201cJust Friends,\u201d try \u201cSpirited\u201d\n\nRyan Reynolds and Will Ferrell in this year's 'Spirited.' Claire Folger/Apple\n\nIf for no other reason than to witness the union of two Hollywood greats, this year\u2019s \u201cSpirited\u201d is a safe and fun bet since it brings together Will Ferrell and Ryan Reynolds, who were featured in two of the most beloved and hilarious Christmas movies from earlier this century \u2013 Ferrell in 2003\u2019s \u201cElf\u201d and Reynolds in \u201cJust Friends\u201d from 2005. The new film is filled with song and dance built around a(nother) fresh take on the classic \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d tale, and it still manages to showcase Reynolds\u2019s trademark smart-aleck delivery as well as Ferrell\u2019s zaniness. The only thing that seems to be missing is Anna Faris\u2019s brilliant and sidesplitting pop star Samantha James from \u201cJust Friends.\u201d\n\nIf you like \u201cGremlins,\u201d try \u201cKrampus\u201d\n\nEmjay Anthony confronts 'Krampus,' from 2015. Steve Unwin/Universal/Legendary/Shutterstock\n\nIf you haven\u2019t quite met your horror quota after Halloween, 2015\u2019s \u201cKrampus\u201d will deliver and then some. Featuring a cast including Adam Scott, unofficial horror queen Toni Collette and the late character actress Conchata Ferrell, the movie riffs off of the Germanic folktale of Krampus, a shadowy pagan figure who comes to punish those who Santa Claus skips over. The movie is an atmospheric slow build, but once the homicidal gingerbread cookies attack, even those nostalgic and cuddly-ferocious Gremlins should run for cover.\n\nIf you liked \u201cA Christmas to Remember,\u201d try \u201cFalling For Christmas\u201d\n\n(L to R) Lindsay Lohan, Chord Overstreet, Olivia Perez and Bus Riley in this year's 'Falling For Christmas.' Scott Everett White/Netflix\n\nFor those who want to go \u201cOverboard\u201d on Hallmark-style holiday fare, Lindsay Lohan has come to the rescue on Netflix this year, bringing viewers the amnesia-themed \u201cFalling For Christmas,\u201d which feels startlingly similar to the 2016 movie \u201cA Christmas to Remember\u201d starring Mira Sorvino. In both, a mishap befalls a privileged and pretty young woman, who learns about life lessons and the spirit of Christmas from a flannel-wearing hunk in a small town. The major beats are there, and nothing else much matters apart from LiLo\u2019s doe-eyed cuteness and killer holiday fashion.\n\nIf you liked \u201cThe Family Stone,\u201d try \u201cLast Christmas\u201d\n\nEmilia Clarke and Henry Golding in 2019's 'Last Christmas.' Universal Pictures\n\nWho doesn\u2019t love a tearjerker around the holidays? \u201cThe Family Stone\u201d from 2005 is a warm and charming family Christmas movie that builds to a heartbreaking climax, one that you can see coming in the more recent \u201cLast Christmas\u201d from 2019, which features Emilia Clarke as a free spirit who crosses paths with prim and proper Henry Golding. While it might be just a touch more heavy on the heartstrings, \u201cLast Christmas\u201d also stars Emma Thompson (who co-wrote the script) and this year\u2019s awards darling Michelle Yeoh of \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once.\u201d Plus, it features music from the late and great George Michael (the title of the movie is not an accident).\n\nIf you liked \u201cDie Hard,\u201d try \u201cThe Tower\u201d\n\n'The Tower,' featuring Son Ye-jin (left), CJ Entertainment/Everett Collection\n\n\u201cDie Hard\u201d is everyone\u2019s favorite alternative knock \u2018em, sock \u2018em Christmas action movie that earns its spot in the category only because it just so happens to take place during a highrise Christmas party. And while Korean movie \u201cThe Tower\u201d from 2012 doesn\u2019t include snooty hijackers like the dearly departed Alan Rickman, the story about a luxury skyscraper catching fire during a Christmas Eve party feels like the love child of \u201cDie Hard\u201d and \u201cThe Towering Inferno\u201d you didn\u2019t know you needed, providing a perfect viewing opportunity for those in the mood for more daunting and death-defying antics instead of snowflakes and mistletoe.\n\nIf you liked \u201cJingle All the Way,\u201d try \u201c8-Bit Christmas\u201d\n\n(L-R) Winslow Fegley and Steve Zahn in '8-Bit Christmas' from 2021. Sabrina Lantos/Warer Bros/Everett Collection\n\nLast year\u2019s \u201c8-Bit Christmas\u201d ramped up the nostalgia factor big time, with this endearing throwback tale centered around a young boy on a quest to receive the ultimate gift in the \u201980s \u2013 a Nintendo video game system. Much like \u201cJingle All the Way,\u201d which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger and is now solidly \u201890s-nostalgic, \u201c8-Bit Christmas\u201d hinges on the rabid fury that overtakes Christmas shoppers as they embark on their mission to procure the gifts they so desperately need (this also shows up, beautifully, in the opening credits of \u201cKrampus,\u201d above). What\u2019s more, \u201c8-Bit\u201d features Neil Patrick Harris of \u201cDoogie Howser\u201d fame \u2013 a walking piece of nostalgia himself. (\u201c8-Bit Christmas\u201d is available for streaming on HBO Max, which like CNN is part of the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.)\n\nIf you liked \u201cLove, Actually,\u201d try the Christmas episode from \u201cTed Lasso,\u201d \u201cCarol of the Bells\u201d\n\nJason Sudeikis and Hannah Waddingham in 'Ted Lasso.' Apple TV+\n\n\u201cLove, Actually\u201d enthusiasts are some of the most vocal Christmas movie fans of them all, and while nothing can totally capture the magic of that ensemble film (except, perhaps, the anniversary special on it that recently aired), Emmy-winning feel-good series \u201cTed Lasso\u201d came pretty close with the fourth episode from last year\u2019s second season, which is arguably the best entry from the show to date. Between Roy and Keeley\u2019s bonkers quest to freshen the breath of a little girl to Rebecca\u2019s lovely gesture towards Ted, the episode is winsome, warm, sweet, and unmistakably British \u2013 just like Hugh Grant.", "label": "human"}

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in online shopping, as more people opt for the convenience of staying at home rather than venturing out to physical stores. As a result, many investors are seeking to capitalize on this trend by investing in a specific type of financial instrument.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, this instrument is a type of investment vehicle that tracks the performance of a basket of assets, similar to a stock. It's comprised of a diverse range of companies, offering exposure to various industries. The retail sector is particularly popular, as it provides a snapshot of the companies driving consumer spending.\n\nTop performers in this space include the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund, which tracks the performance of a specific index comprising 87 companies, including prominent retail brands. Over the past year, this fund has returned a significant percentage, with a notable gain over the past three months.\n\nAnother popular choice is the VanEck Vectors Retail ETF, which tracks the performance of a global retail index comprising 33 stocks. This fund has also delivered impressive returns over the past year and three months.\n\nA newer entrant in the market is the Invesco Dynamic Retail ETF, which tracks the performance of an index comprising 55 US-listed companies from the retail sector. This fund has also demonstrated strong performance over the past year and three months.\n\nAside from these funds, investors can also consider actively managed ETFs, such as the ProShares Online Retail ETF, which tracks the performance of an index comprising 30 US-listed online retail stocks. This fund has delivered impressive returns over the past year and three months.\n\nWhile the retail sector has been a hot topic in 2020, investors should be aware of the potential risks associated with investing in this space. Market risks, such as economic downturns or company-specific issues, can impact the performance of these funds. Additionally, the volatility of retail stocks may make them a risky investment for those seeking a stable and conservative strategy.\n\nIt's essential for investors to understand the potential risks and rewards of investing in retail ETFs before adding them to their portfolio.

{"text": "North Korea fired a suspected intercontinental ballistic missile Friday, the South Korean and Japanese governments said, a day after resuming weapons tests as it vowed \"fiercer\" military responses to the United States strengthening its alliances with South Korea and Japan.\n\nIt would be the second ICBM North Korea has fired this month and the third this year, after refraining from conducting such tests since 2017. The missiles are designed to strike the mainland United States.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters that a ballistic missile had landed in waters west of the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. He said there were no reports of damage to vessels or planes in the area.\n\nA suspected ICBM was launched from the Soonan area in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, toward the country's eastern waters around 10:15 a.m. (8:15 p.m. Thursday ET), South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said.\n\nJapan's Ministry of Defense also said it appeared to be an ICBM-class ballistic missile. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said it was believed to have flown about 620 miles and reached a maximum altitude of 3,728 miles.\n\nBoth the South Korean and Japanese governments convened emergency meetings after the launch. They said they were closely monitoring the situation in coordination with the U.S., which has military bases in both countries.\n\nNorth Korea has been testing missiles at an unprecedented rate this year, but it had been quiet for about a week until Thursday, when it launched a short-range ballistic missile toward its eastern waters. The launch appeared to be in protest of a trilateral summit in Cambodia on Sunday between President Joe Biden, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and Kishida, who vowed a unified and coordinated response to North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui said the summit would bring a \"more unpredictable phase\" in the situation on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nU.S. and South Korean officials say North Korea is also preparing to conduct its seventh nuclear test, which would be its first since 2017.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The subject of Jeffrey Dahmer, a notorious American serial killer responsible for the murder and dismemberment of 17 individuals between 1978 and 1991, has sparked a new documentary series on Netflix. The series, \"Monster: Jeffrey Dahmer,\" provides an in-depth look at Dahmer's life, featuring interviews with those who knew him, footage from crime scenes, and an exploration of his twisted psyche.\n\nThe documentary has received criticism for potentially sensationalizing and romanticizing Dahmer's actions, with some arguing that it humanizes and glorifies violence. The filmmakers, however, intend to explore the factors that led Dahmer to commit such heinous crimes, rather than celebrating his actions.\n\nDespite the filmmakers' good intentions, the series has faced backlash, with concerns that it may glamorize Dahmer's actions and make him out to be a \"supervillain.\" Others feel that using a serial killer's story for entertainment is inappropriate and can make his actions seem normal and acceptable.\n\nThe release of \"Monster: Jeffrey Dahmer\" coincides with the growing popularity of true crime television. While exploring crime and its causes can be valuable, it's essential to consider how these stories are presented and how they might be received. The impact on viewers and the potential effects on victims' families and the community at large should also be taken into account.\n\nTrue crime documentaries can be powerful tools for exploring crime and its causes, but it's crucial to be aware of how these stories might affect society and the people involved. The filmmakers have an opportunity to explore a twisted and horrific case, but it's essential to consider the potential consequences of their work.", "label": "machine"}

Perhaps that console you got for the holidays could benefit from a sharper display. Or maybe you're upgrading your main screen ahead of next month's Big Game. Either way, there are deals to be had.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to upgrade, the price difference between a 50-, 55- and 65-inch TV can often be fairly negligible, though prices do start to tick upward when you\u2019re looking at 75-inch and larger screens. It\u2019s important to fit your screen size to your room, though. Don\u2019t squeeze a 55-inch set in a bedroom where a 32-inch will do for an hour of late-night TV before calling it quits.\n\nFor resolution, we recommend at minimum a 1080p screen, but most of us will probably prefer to take advantage of all the 4K programming on streaming and cable these days.

{"text": "Student loan borrowers still face a long road to find out if they will get federal debt cancellation after the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed its opening brief to the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday.\n\nIn it, the DOJ defended the legality of the Biden Administration\u2019s student loan forgiveness program announced in August, arguing the plan is clearly within the Education Security's authority under a 2003 act. It also argued that a second lawsuit brought by Missouri lacks standing.\n\nThe brief is the latest development in a legal fight that started in November and has left nearly 40 million student loan borrowers uncertain about the future of their finances.\n\n\"As the brief makes clear, the debt relief plan is not only lawful, it is critical to millions of working- and middle- class Americans who are otherwise at risk of falling behind as they work to recover from the pandemic,\u201d said Abby Shafroth, staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center and director of the Student Loan Borrowers Assistance Project. \u201cThe plan is designed to give people burdened by student debt breathing room as they recover from the pandemic, and to avoid a projected wave of student loan delinquencies and defaults when the pause on payments ends.\"\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 02: Student loan borrowers gathered at the Supreme Court today to tell the court that student loan relief is legal on January 02, 2023 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Larry French/Getty Images for We, The 45 Million)\n\n\u2018Legal authority\u2019\n\nIn November, the Education Department (ED) stopped taking applications for student loan forgiveness after a Texas federal district court judge ruled the program is a violation of legislative power and the St. Louis-based 8th Circuit Appellate Court imposed an injunction. Shortly after, the Biden Administration asked the U.S. Supreme Court to reinstate the program.\n\nThe brief this week addressed both of those cases.\n\nIn the Texas case, the DOJ argues that the HEROES Act expressly states that the Education Secretary has the authority to act in a national emergency \u2014 in this case, COVID-19 \u2014 to make sure borrowers are not left worse off with respect to their loans than they were before the emergency. According to the DOJ, the act allows the Secretary to move forward with the program without public comments.\n\nStory continues\n\nUS President Joe Biden and Department of Education Secretary Miguel Cardona. (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nThe brief also noted the act was used by both the Biden Administration and the Trump Administration when they paused federal student loan payments during the pandemic.\n\nIn the 8th Circuit case, the DOJ brief argues that the state of Missouri lacks standing to sue based on potential harm the forgiveness program may bring to the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority, or MOHELA, a loan servicer in the state. The DOJ argues that MOHELA is a separate entity from the state and harm to MOHELA is not harm to the state. Further, any claimed harm to MOHELA is based on multiple levels of speculation the Supreme Court has long rejected as a basis for standing.\n\n\u201cWe remain confident in our legal authority to adopt this program that will ensure the financial harms caused by the pandemic don\u2019t drive borrowers into delinquency and default,\u201d Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in a press release.\n\nLong road ahead still\n\nThe Biden Administration\u2019s brief, though, is only the start.\n\nThere will likely be more legal filings before the Supreme Court hears oral arguments in late February and renders an opinion. Opponents in the Texas and 8th Circuit cases have until Jan. 27 to submit their brief, and DOJ has until Feb. 15 to respond.\n\n\u201cThe arguments about the plaintiffs lacking legal standing seem strong. The arguments on the merits are somewhat weaker,\u201d Mark Kantrowski, author and student loan expert, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cDuring the hearings we may get a sense as to the direction the court will take based on the questions asked by the justices. A ruling could come as early as March or as late as June/July.\u201d\n\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.\n\nIn the meantime, borrowers should update their contact information with their loan servicer and on StudentAid.gov, and start saving an amount equal to their monthly payments to prepare for the restart of student loan repayment, Kantrowitz said.\n\nPresident Biden last month extended the payment pause on federal student loans until June 30, 2023. If litigation has not been resolved by then, payments will begin 60 days after that.\n\nFor borrowers who are worried about restarting payments, Cody Hounanian, executive director of the Student Debt Crisis Center (SDCC), recommends they look into different student loan repayment options as well as updates to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.\n\n\"Being aware of your income-driven repayment plan options will help ensure payments are affordable for those that have current payments or will have their payments turned back on after pandemic relief,\" Hounanian said.\n\nRonda is a personal finance senior reporter for Yahoo Money and attorney with experience in law, insurance, education, and government.

{"text": "Citi is bearish on lithium \u2014 at least for the near future. That's because China's huge electric vehicle market is showing signs of slowing, the bank said, citing the country's removal of EV subsidies and Tesla's suspension of production at its Shanghai plant. Lithium is a critical component of electric vehicle batteries. On top of that, demand in Europe has been slowing, thanks to high electricity prices and an economic slowdown, the bank added. \"[We] remain cautious on lithium commodity as \u2026 EVs sales could be softer in 2023 after the subsidy expires and China lithium spot price may face headwinds beyond 1Q23,\" Citi said in a Jan. 3 note. But the bank isn't turning fully negative on lithium, saying it's bullish on its long-term outlook. It expects lithium demand to increase its compound annual growth rate by around 20% by 2030, and that its supply will struggle to catch up. Names to watch Citi named three stocks to watch despite its cautious lithium outlook. Its most preferred name is U.S.-based Albemarle , which it gave a price target of $295, or 38% upside. Citi also likes Livent Corporation , which it gave a $27 target price, or 42% upside. But it warned that Livent, being a pure-play lithium producer, is a stock sensitive to changes in the lithium market. \"Lithium has the potential for high growth, driven by demand for battery applications. Therefore, changes in the pace of adoption for electric vehicles or electronics, due to energy prices or some other factors, could have significant implications for long-term lithium supply/demand,\" Citi analysts wrote. The bank added that as Livent's business is heavily reliant on its lithium resource in Argentina, the Salar del Hombre Muerto, any political or economic risks in the country would affect the firm. For instance, Argentina recently imposed an export tax on certain products including lithium, Citi noted. Citi also named Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile , the world's largest lithium producer, which soared 58% in 2022. Citi downgraded the stock from \"buy\" to \"neutral\" in mid-December, giving it a price target of $92 \u2014 with upside of about 20%. But the bank expects more risks to the downside for the firm, citing price volatility as a main risk to that target. \"Prices of SQM's products are linked to international prices, which vary significantly due to supply/demand dynamics,\" Citi said.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Zoom Video Communications, a prominent video conferencing company, experienced a significant decline in its stock price on Monday following the release of a relatively modest forecast for its future financial performance and CEO Eric Yuan's acknowledgement of increased regulatory scrutiny.\n\nThe California-based company, which went public in April at a valuation of $10 billion, has seen its shares surge more than 560% since its initial public offering, trading at a peak of nearly $550 in October. Zoom is well-known for enabling users to connect with each other using its video chat service, both for personal and professional reasons.\n\nHowever, the stock price slid as much as 6.8% on Monday after Yuan commented in a letter to shareholders that the company is \"mindful of the heightened level of regulatory scrutiny we have received.\" In the letter, Yuan stated that the company is still investing in \"enhancing our privacy and security practices\" despite already having made significant improvements since the beginning of the year.\n\nThe CEO added that although Zoom has done \"everything we could\" to properly implement its privacy and security measures, the company may need to consider changes to comply with evolving regulations.\n\nThe company's full-year forecast also likely contributed to the decline. Zoom expects annual revenue of $2.37 billion to $2.39 billion, lower than analyst estimates of $2.51 billion. The company still expects to post an operating margin of about 20%.\n\nIn the letter to shareholders, Yuan noted that Zoom had to make \"short-term trade-offs\" to keep up with the massive user growth it experienced this year, when demand for the company's video-conferencing product skyrocketed as people began to work from home and physically distanced from each other during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic, Zoom has seen its user base grow from about 10 million people in December 2019 to over 300 million by October 2020, according to The Wall Street Journal. Revenue in the third quarter ended Oct. 31 grew 367% year-on-year to $777.2 million, beating analyst expectations of $733 million.\n\nYuan emphasized that Zoom had not made any changes to its product and plans to continue focusing on user experience and privacy and security.\n\n\"We have a clear strategy, focused on users and user experience, and also know that we must continually seek to improve our privacy and security practices,\" Yuan wrote.\n\nAnalysts believe the stock decline was likely due to the company's lower forecast, as well as Yuan's acknowledgment of the heightened regulatory scrutiny.\n\n\"The company offered FY21 guidance below the Street, but we believe investors are now more focused on the regulatory pressure coming from privacy and security concerns,\" Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a note to clients Monday.\n\nYuan expressed confidence that Zoom's strong brand name and product offering will make it successful in the long term, and also mentioned the positive feedback the company has been receiving from users.\n\n\"The positive feedback we receive from users, especially our education customers, encourages us to continue investing in our products and services and to focus on how best to serve our user base,\" he wrote.\n\nLooking ahead, the CEO said Zoom's board of directors is considering strategies that could maximize shareholder value. While he did not mention any specific strategies, the company has previously suggested it could pursue \"certain stock option grants\" and other similar actions, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nAnalysts believe Zoom shares have more room to grow, despite the sharp stock drop on Monday.\n\n\"Zoom has a one-of-a-kind user base and continues to be the \"it\" stock in this new work from home/stay at home world we are living in,\" Ives wrote. \"The next 12 to 18 months are critical for the company to monetize, and show positive traction of its user base for the bull thesis to play out for the stock.\"", "label": "machine"}

It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I met my husband, Prince Kunle, I was at the peak of my modeling career.\n\nIt was the middle of New York Fashion Week in 2004, and all the models were going on show castings at the time. I was newly single and had just exited a relationship that was not for me. I was happy being single and was enjoying my career \u2014 I wasn't at all looking for a boyfriend.\n\nI was in Union Square, looking for an address for an audition that I was meant to be on. I didn't know this at the time, but the casting director had given the wrong address. So I'm standing there, calling my agency, and I felt someone's presence. I felt someone staring at me.\n\nI see Kunle standing there, and I'm thinking, \"Do I know this person?\"\n\nI didn't think that he would wait around for me to get off the phone, but he did.\n\nHe came up to me and said: \"You are the most beautiful person I've ever seen in my entire life. Would you do me the honor of having your number? Because I'd love to take you out.\"\n\nHonestly, I was thinking, \"Who talks like that?\" I made up a line that I had a boyfriend so that I couldn't give him my number, and I turned to walk away. But as I was about to go for my audition, my women's intuition said: \"You know what? He was kind. He wasn't rude. He was tall, dark, and handsome. You should just give him your number.\"\n\nSo I ran back up the steps, and he was still there, phone in hand, smiling as if he knew I would come back.\n\nWe dated for 2 years before I learned that Kunle was a prince\n\nWe dated for two years, and I did not know he was royal. I knew that he was Nigerian and that he previously lived in London, but I had no idea about his background.\n\nIn Nigerian culture, when you are serious about someone, that's when you introduce them to your family. I remember going to a family wedding and his mom coming out with open arms. It was almost like she knew me already.\n\nShe kept calling me \"my princess.\" I was thinking it was a term of endearment, since a lot of moms call their daughters princesses. That's when I discovered he was a royal. She started telling me the history of the kings, his name and its meaning, and where he was from.\n\nKeisha and Kunle at their former home in London in 2021. Mikhaila Friel/Insider\n\nKunle is a crown prince from the Arugbabuwo ruling house. Unlike the British royals, where there's one family and lots of royals within that family, in Nigeria there are many tribes and many royal families within those tribes. Not all of those tribes have a crown prince \u2014 the crown prince is the chosen one who is going to rule at a certain age.\n\nI remember thinking, \"We've been together for two years, and he just left that detail out?\"\n\nIt was a nice thing to know, but it didn't affect our lifestyle. It would have, if he had chosen to be king in Nigeria. That's when everything changes and you literally give up life as you know it. We would have to live and remain in Nigeria. We would not hold our own schedules and would not have the luxury of traveling when we want to travel or where we want to travel. It would no longer be acceptable for me to call Prince Kunle \"my baby,\" \"my honey,\" or any other name apart from King Omilana. We would also not have the freedom to be together every day and in every way like we are now.\n\nHe made it very clear to me that while this is his bloodline and this is who he is, it's not how he lives his life when he's not in Nigeria.\n\nWe started our married life in NYC before spending time in Dubai, Cyprus, and London\n\nWe married on January 28, 2006. Our son, Diran, was born later that year and our daughter, Dior, was born six years after that. Both of my children were born in New York, and about nine months after Diran's seventh birthday we moved to Dubai.\n\nA post shared by Princess Keisha Omilana (@keishaomilana)\n\nWe stayed there for about a year before moving to Cyprus. After a year in Cyprus, we moved back to London, which has always been a second home to Kunle.\n\nWe stayed in London for seven years. It was wonderful. We launched our companies there, and we raised Dior there. It was nice to be there with the children \u2014 to go back as a family was really fun.\n\nKunle and I experienced discrimination in the UK\n\nWe like to focus on positive things, but at the same time, it is always necessary to raise awareness of injustice. And this is for pretty much anyone and everyone who happens to not be English.\n\nThe discrimination occurred very subtly and was mostly witnessed in our business dealings and in one former neighborhood.\n\nIt's not even a racist thing, as far as us being Black. When it comes to England, what I've learned after being there for seven years is that it's a non-British thing. So the same thing that I'm feeling, that I've been discriminated against, my friend who is Australian \u2014 who is not Black \u2014 is going through.\n\nIt's more so: \"We are English, this is how we do it. And you're not one of us.\" Especially when you're doing business and you're moving in those circles and they're not used to seeing people who don't look like them.\n\nWe dealt with that quite a lot, and we just dealt with it with grace and ease. We stayed classy, we stayed professional, but it was something we noticed and experienced. I must say though that is not just a UK thing. Prince Kunle and I have traveled all over the world and lived on four continents. Discrimination has unfortunately been experienced before.\n\nIt is very important that this statement is not mistaken as a portrayal of myself as a helpless victim. In England, I encountered extremely subtle forms of discrimination. However, If I were an English elite, this exhausting act of one seeking to validate their accomplishments by working ten times harder to earn what one deserves would not have occurred. We all saw this play out in the press and media coverage of the Duchess of Sussex.\n\nI am keenly aware of the difference between how Meghan is covered in the news versus how Kate Middleton is covered in the news.\n\nI hear things like, \"How dare they leave?\" It's kind of like: \"Yes, we don't like you. But you have to stay here and hear it every day.\" Why would you want them to stay in that?\n\nI understand the struggles that Meghan Markle has faced\n\nI always say that Meghan Markle and I have a lot of parallels, just for the fact that we are both women of color, we are both married to royalty, we are both from California, and we're both actresses. We are also both feminists advocating for women's empowerment.\n\nMeghan Markle and Prince Harry in a promo for their docuseries, \"Harry & Meghan.\" Netflix\n\nI personally don't watch the news or read tabloids. I do that purposefully because a lot of the time it's just negative, and I don't want to feed my soul with negative energy. But I am aware of what's going on because I'm on social media and I hear about it.\n\nWhenever you are linked to someone or compared to someone, your eyes are opened to what their life is. I wish people would lead with empathy and put themselves in that person's shoes. Would you want to wake up every day and be scrutinized in a negative way?\n\nIt's a shame. And I really tip my hat to Harry and Meghan for standing up to The Firm, for choosing their happiness and their mental health, for saying that they want to live a life where they are free to be who they are.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "One kilo gold bars are pictured at the plant of gold and silver refiner and bar manufacturer Argor-Heraeus in Mendrisio, Switzerland, July 13, 2022. Denis Balibouse | Reuters\n\nLONDON \u2014 The price of gold notched a six-month high early on Tuesday, and analysts believe the rally has further to go in 2023. Spot gold peaked just below $1,850 per troy ounce in the early hours, before easing off to trade around $1,834 per ounce by late-morning in Europe. U.S. gold futures were up 0.8% at $1,840.50. Gold prices have been on a general incline since the beginning of November as market turbulence, rising recession expectations, and more gold purchases from central banks underpinned demand. \"In general, we are looking for a price friendly 2023 supported by recession and stock market valuation risks \u2014 an eventual peak in central bank rates combined with the prospect of a weaker dollar and inflation not returning to the expected sub-3% level by year-end \u2014 all adding support,\" said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank.\n\nLoading chart...\n\n\"In addition, the de-dollarization seen by several central banks last year when a record amount of gold was bought look set to continue, thereby providing a soft floor under the market.\" Looking ahead, Hansen suggested the key events for gold prices would be Wednesday's minutes from the latest U.S. Federal Reserve meeting and Friday's U.S. jobs report. \"Above $1842, the 50% [mark] of the 2022 correction, gold will be looking for resistance at $1850 and $1878 next,\" Hansen added. New all-time high in 2023? Much of the 2023 outlook for global markets hinges on the trajectory of monetary policy as central banks ease off the aggressive interest rate hikes of the past year amid slowing economic growth and possible recessions. Economists are divided as to whether this will culminate in rate cuts by the end of the year, however, as inflation is expected to remain well above the target range in most major economies. A full dovish pivot by central banks this year would likely have major implications for gold prices, according to strategists.\n\nwatch now\n\nEric Strand, manager of the AuAg ESG Gold Mining ETF, said last month that 2023 would yield a new all-time high for gold and the start of a \"new secular bull market,\" with the price exceeding $2,100 per ounce. \"Central banks as a group have continued, since the great financial crisis, to add more and more gold to their reserves, with a new record set for [the third quarter of] 2022,\" Strand said. \"It is our opinion that central banks will pivot on their rate hikes and become dovish during 2023, which will ignite an explosive move for gold for years to come. We therefore believe gold will end 2023 at least 20% higher, and we also see miners outperforming gold with a factor of two.\"\n\nwatch now", "label": "human"}

However, Jim Cramer cautioned Friday that investors should still be wary of mega-cap tech stocks \u2013 these remain difficult to own, and the Club is exercising caution to ensure our tech exposure remains limited. 2. Wait to buy Constellation Brands Cowen on Friday downgraded Constellation Brands (STZ) to market perform from outperform, or buy, citing concerns that consumers will trade down alcoholic beverages as the economy slows. However, the beermaker continues to take market share while flexing its pricing power, so we still like the stock. Constellation on Thursday reported a weak 2023 fiscal third quarter, with the stock closing down nearly 10%. But shares climbed close to 3% in midmorning trading Friday, to roughly $215 apiece. We advise investors to hold off on buying STZ for now, until the dust settles. 3. Stick with Wells Fargo Deutsche Bank on Thursday downgraded JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Truist (TFC) to hold from buy, citing macroeconomic headwinds and concerns about weakening bank fundamentals. But not all banks are built the same, and Wells Fargo (WFC) remains a great stock to own despite analysts' concerns about the financial sector more broadly.

REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHAVANA, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. embassy in Havana resumed full immigrant visa processing and consular services for the first time since 2017 on Wednesday in a bid to stem the record-breaking flow of illegal migrants from Cuba north to the United States.\n\nThe embassy, which looms over Cuba's waterfront Malecon boulevard, slashed services in 2017 after several of its staff were stricken with a still largely unexplained ailment dubbed \"Havana Syndrome.\" It was first reported among U.S. officials in 2016 and symptoms included nausea and memory lapses.\n\nCubans were instead required to travel to Guyana for visa processing, a costly trip well out of reach for most on the island. The U.S. embassy in Havana began limited visa processing last year and in September announced the 2023 full reopening, to \"ensure safe, legal, and orderly migration of Cubans,\" it said.\n\nAt sunrise on Wednesday, dozens of Cubans, some who had waited years for appointments, assembled at a small park near the embassy, fidgeting with documents and chatting with family as they awaited instructions from embassy staff.\n\nBarbara Nodas, 20, said she was waiting to pick up a visa that would reunite her with her father in Tampa, Florida, a process that had taken more than two years.\n\n\"The American dream of many people is coming true,\" she said, nearly in tears. \"This is a long-awaited moment.\"\n\nBut Nodas, who traveled from eastern Cuba to pick up her visa, still ranks among the lucky few who will make the voyage north legally.\n\nWashington last year issued 20,000 immigrant visas to Cubans, including a limited number out of Havana, in line with previously signed migration accords, and has said it aims to do the same in 2023.\n\nCuba and the United States have also resumed once-regular talks on migration in a bid to tamp down the flow.\n\nBut a record-breaking 250,000 Cubans have nonetheless left the island in the past year for the United States, most via dangerous, irregular routes, traveling overland from Central America north to the border or across the Straits of Florida in precarious homemade rafts.\n\nCuba blames the U.S. embargo, a web of U.S. laws and regulations that complicate business and financial transactions with the island, for crippling its economy and fueling illegal migration.\n\nWidespread shortages of food, fuel, medicine and electricity - made worse by the coronavirus pandemic - have prompted scattered unrest on the island and sought many to seek alternatives abroad.\n\nReporting by Dave Sherwood and Mario Fuentes in Havana Editing by Matthew Lewis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "As prominent technology companies adapt to the pandemic's impact, a leading cloud-based software provider, headquartered in San Francisco, recently announced that it has notified all U.S.-based employees who have been released from their positions.\n\nIn a statement, the company acknowledged that it had made the challenging decision to reduce its workforce, but did not disclose the exact number of individuals affected.\n\nThe statement emphasized that the company has appropriately notified and provided termination benefits to the affected employees, and will continue to offer job transition and career coaching services through its social responsibility arm, Salesforce Careers.\n\nThis development appears to be part of a broader trend in the technology sector. TechCrunch recently reported that the company had initiated a series of layoffs globally, with the U.S. being one of the first regions impacted.\n\nThe combination of layoffs, voluntary pay reductions, other cost-cutting measures, and the CEO's sale of shares around the same time suggests that the company is undergoing a period of significant restructuring.\n\nThe CEO emphasized the company's commitment to supporting its staff, stating that the company is making changes to ensure it has the necessary resources to succeed in the long-term and deliver for its customers.\n\nHe also expressed gratitude to employees who have taken on increased workloads, worked extra hours, and contributed to the company's successful transition during challenging times, acknowledging their dedication and hard work.\n\nDespite the company's efforts, reports have surfaced suggesting that further layoffs are planned. According to the Wall Street Journal, the company could cut up to 10 percent of its global workforce, or around 3,000 jobs, primarily in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nAlthough the company has not confirmed these reports, some managers have allegedly informed their teams that the cuts are likely to occur, with some teams reportedly being told that they can expect to receive more information in the near future.\n\nIn addition, Bloomberg reports that the company is considering suspending or eliminating its stock buyback program and will also be reducing hiring.\n\nIf reports are accurate, it appears that the company is restructuring to remain competitive in the current market. Many technology companies have had to reduce their workforces and make changes to remain viable in the current economic climate.\n\nFor now, the company will continue to support its employees and navigate this challenging situation. However, for those employees who have been affected by layoffs or other restructuring measures, the news is not encouraging.

{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nOmie Dale has fond memories of splashing in the sea as a child, of racing through water parks and swimming in backwaters and rivers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much joy that can be had once you learn to swim, once you\u2019ve abandoned those fears and you can get in the water,\u201d the 25-year-old Dale, who is based in southeast London, tells CNN Sport.\n\nEven though swimming is a joyful experience for Dale, the stark reality is that many Black communities in Britain and the US do not have safe access to swimming lessons and public pools due to historic racism and segregation \u2013 a problem that is especially alarming given that, as Dale says, it is \u201cthe only sport that can save your life.\u201d\n\nA history of exclusion\n\nThe lack of access afforded to Black communities in Britain is what motivated Dale to become a swimming teacher in September 2019.\n\n\u201cI used to work in Kensington (in London) as a lifeguard and some of the richest people live in that borough, but also some of the poorest,\u201d she says. She saw there was a difference when private schools and independent schools would come in and all the kids were able to swim, yet hardly any children of the same age that Dale saw from state schools could swim 25 meters.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real class barrier in the sport of swimming,\u201d Dale adds.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Meet the Black women pushing for equality in swimming 04:56 - Source: CNN\n\nShe is a director of Swimunity, a collective offering free swimming lessons to women and children in North Kensington, West London.\n\nIt was born in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster in 2017, when a residential block caught on fire, killing 72 people \u2013 and leaving many more without homes.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s like a lot of people who come to swim lessons \u2026 who have undergone some form of trauma, whether that be water-related trauma or trauma related to their everyday lives,\u201d Dale says.\n\n\u201cMany people say it\u2019s like an escape from their daily lives or is, actually, the first time that they\u2019ve taken time for themselves.\u201d\n\nWhile 77% of children from the most affluent families in England can swim 25 meters unaided, only 34% from the least affluent families can, according to a 2021 survey from Sport England, a non-departmental public body that fosters grassroots sports in England.\n\nAbout 95% of Black adults and 80% of Black children in England do not regularly participate in swimming, according to Sport England\u2019s report, published in January 2020.\n\nLikewise, about 93% of Asian adults and 78% of Asian children, including those with Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage, do not regularly participate in swimming, the same research found.\n\nThis trend extends to the US, where nearly 64% of Black children have \u201clow\u201d or no ability to swim, compared with 40% of their White peers, according to 2017 data from the country\u2019s national governing body for the sport at a competitive level, USA Swimming.\n\nThe underrepresentation of Black people in the pool in the US can be traced back to the early 20th century.\n\nPublic swimming pools became popular in North America in the 1920s and 30s and were initially open to all. However, Northern politicians stipulated a \u201cWhites Only\u201d rule, referencing racist fears about Black men fraternizing with White women.\n\nOmie Dale told CNN Sport that \"there's a real class barrier in the sport of swimming.\" Dale founded Swimunity in 2020 to help address structural barriers and introduce the joy of swimming to as many people as possible. Louis Lesson/CNN\n\nEven after legal racial segregation ended in the US in 1964, public pools continued to be hostile environments. As people of color began to use public pools, White swimmers retreated to the privacy of their own pools and private clubs, where expensive fees continue to be an economic barrier for Black families who cannot afford the cost.\n\nSimilar examples in Britain illustrate how racial and class inequalities lead to the systemic exclusion of Black people in pools. For example, more than 4.2 million people in the UK live in ethnically diverse communities where Covid-19 national lockdowns resulted in the closure or mothballing of pools, according to Swim England \u2013 England\u2019s national swimming governing body \u2013 and the Black Swimming Association (BSA), a UK-based charity that aims to encourage more African, Caribbean and Asian communities to take up swimming.\n\n\u2018We cannot keep recovering bodies\u2019\n\nGlobally, drowning is the third leading cause of accidental injury-related death and at least 236,000 people die each year from drowning, according to 2019 data from the World Health Organization (WHO). Children are particularly affected, with drowning being one of the top five causes of death for those aged 1-14 years in 48 of 85 countries studied by the WHO.\n\nAnd while natural disasters and irregular migration are notorious risk factors, so are lower socioeconomic status, lack of higher education and being a member of an ethnic minority, depending on the country, WHO research shows.\n\n\u201cMost drowning incidents happen when people never intend to get into the water in the first place,\u201d says Dale, who was awarded Swim Teacher of the Year by Swim England in 2021.\n\nIn December 2019, three members of the same Black British family \u2013 a 53-year-old father and his two children \u2013 died in a swimming pool at a resort in Costa del Sol, Spain, Reuters reported. The father and his 16-year-old son had reportedly leapt into the water to try to save his nine-year-old daughter, who was drowning.\n\nDanielle Obe is the co-founder and chair of the Black Swimming Association (BSA). Louis Leeson/CNN\n\nDanielle Obe is the co-founder and chair of the BSA. She told CNN Sport that the Costa del Sol deaths prompted her to establish the BSA in March 2020, alongside Olympic swimmer Alice Dearing, journalist Seren Jones and songwriter, rapper and producer Ed Accura.\n\n\u201cThis was devastating because these families were actually acquainted to me and they were from my local community,\u201d Obe says. \u201c(At) that point, I called Alice and Seren, and I said, \u2018We\u2019ve been talking about doing something for our community. We\u2019ve got to do something. We\u2019ve got to do it now. We cannot keep recovering bodies.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something. We\u2019ve got to do it now. We cannot keep recovering bodies.\u201d Danielle Obe, Black Swimming Association (BSA) chair and co-founder\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no longer just about that lack of representation,\u201d Obe adds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now about saving lives, vital water safety, education for all. Swimming is an intervention. Swimming is a life skill.\u201d\n\nHowever, there is still a lack of data when it comes to drowning-related deaths by ethnicity in the UK, says Obe.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, we don\u2019t know how much of a disparity there is between drowning and fatalities, aquatic fatalities for different communities in the UK because, up until now, drowning data isn\u2019t really captured by ethnicity, which is another point, another issue that the BSA is looking to tackle.\u201d\n\n\u2018People just don\u2019t think Black people should swim\u2019\n\nDearing, the first Black female swimmer to represent Britain at the Olympics when she competed at Tokyo 2020, \u201cimplores\u201d people to learn to swim.\n\n\u201cI have been quite torn between the amazing achievement of being the first Black woman to represent GB in swimming but wanting to be my own person, my own athlete, who\u2019s known for being an athlete and not for her race and her sport combined together,\u201d she tells CNN Sport.\n\n\u201cI take the two of them just as they are \u2013 kind of like separate things. I\u2019m trying to be the best athlete and best role model that I can be to show people that they can do the sport, that the sport is for everybody.\u201d\n\nAt the age of 24, Dearing was making history in Japan and became a beacon of hope for young people \u2013 especially Black girls \u2013 who wanted to break into the sport.\n\nBut her personal triumph also drew attention to the institutional access gap for people of color in swimming.\n\nAlice Dearing co-founded the BSA with Obe and several others to help encourage more minority communities to take up swimming. Louis Leeson/CNN\n\n\u201cFortunately, for myself, I haven\u2019t come across any barriers at the level I\u2019m at currently,\u201d Dearing says.\n\n\u201cBut I have faced barriers when I was younger and issues where people just don\u2019t think Black people should swim, or do swim, or think that we\u2019re better suited to other sports and so shouldn\u2019t even learn to swim or attempt swimming in the first place.\u201d\n\nCNN reached out to the International Swimming Federation (FINA), Sport England and USA Swimming requesting a breakdown of Black and ethnic minority participation in swimming at grassroots and professional levels of the sport. However, they told CNN they were unable to provide such data.\n\nFINA \u2013 the global governing body for swimming \u2013 told CNN it does not have a breakdown of the ethnicities of swimmers at a grassroots or elite level.\n\nFINA said in 2021 it allocated $6.6 million towards development programs for distribution among all national federations and continental associations, while also pushing for diversity in the sport through its \u201cSwimming for All, Swimming for Life\u201d program.\n\n\u201cFINA remains fully committed to non-discrimination,\u201d the organization said to CNN in a statement. \u201cFINA continues to work hard to ensure that the global aquatics community is a place where all athletes, coaches and administrators are treated equally.\n\n\u201cWork will continue to develop and grow with the support of members of the aquatics community as we strive to be at the forefront of this essential area,\u201d FINA added.\n\n\u201cI have faced barriers when I was younger and issues where people just don\u2019t think Black people should swim, or do swim, or think that we\u2019re better suited to other sports and so shouldn\u2019t even learn to swim or attempt swimming in the first place.\u201d Alice Dearing, Olympic swimmer and BSA co-founder\n\nSport England told CNN in a statement that it is \u201ccommitted to increasing investment in facilities and organisations across England to try to level up access to good quality sports and activities.\u201d\n\n\u201cBarriers to getting active persist and have even been exacerbated for some disadvantaged groups \u2013 like women, people with long-term health conditions, disabled people, people from ethnically diverse communities and lower socio-economic groups,\u201d the statement added.\n\nSport England said in May it announced further funding that brings its total investment in its 121 partners to more than \u00a3550 million ($670 million), which they\u2019ve selected \u201cdue to their unique position to tackle entrenched activity inequalities and influence positive change throughout the sector, their own networks and beyond.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not all about the economic side of things. It is also about getting people to feel comfortable with putting their kids in swim lessons and in competitive swimming so that they can then go and do other aquatic-based sports,\u201d Joel Shinofield, the managing director of sport development at USA Swimming, told CNN during a phone call.\n\nUSA Swimming is a membership-serviced organization that has over 3,100 clubs and more than 400,000 members, according to the official website.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to facilitate opportunities and make sure they\u2019re good ones. While our clubs are the ones that do that on the local level, the resources, guidance, support, financial investment that we provide can shift who those opportunities can be provided to and more broadly create access,\u201d he added.\n\nShinofield said that USA Swimming has established a 10-year initiative that will grant $1 million to develop learn-to-swim and competitive opportunities for communities served by Historical Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The program was announced in 2021, according to the USA Swimming official website.\n\nServing underrepresented communities\n\nFrom representing their organization at the UK\u2019s first Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Summit For Sport in Birmingham, England earlier this year to facilitating swimming classes in Hackney \u2013 one of the most deprived boroughs in London \u2013 Obe hopes that the BSA will help bridge the barrier through community-level engagement.\n\n\u201cThat community engagement really is to build trust, accountability and collaboration with disenfranchised communities and the sector,\u201d says Obe.\n\n\u201cOnly in understanding these attitudes and understanding some of the barriers that preclude our communities from engaging in aquatics can we begin to drive change.\u201d\n\nIn August 2021, the BSA announced it would conduct a research program with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the University of Portsmouth, exploring the behaviors and barriers that prevent African, Caribbean and Asian communities from swimming.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much joy that can be had once you learn to swim, once you\u2019ve abandoned those fears and you can get in the water.\u201d Omie Dale, Swimunity Director and Instructor\n\nSpeaking about the program, Obe says: \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to inspire confidence with African, Caribbean and Asian communities, and the only way we\u2019re able to do that is to ensure that we understand where these communities are in the first place and understand why they don\u2019t engage in aquatics, why we don\u2019t see the representation pool side and why we don\u2019t even see the representation within some aquatic organizations.\u201d\n\nDale also volunteers with Mental Health Swims, a grassroots organization that facilitates swimming meet-ups for people struggling with their mental health. As part of her work for the organization, she coordinates swim events in south London to help swimmers access the mental health benefits of the sport. She also volunteers for Pride in Water, a network that aims to increase LGBTQ+ representation in swimming.\n\n\u2018The future is bright\u2019\n\nDearing says that despite the racial and economic barriers to swimming for African, Caribbean and Asian communities, she\u2019s still optimistic about the changing landscape of the sport.\n\n\u201cI really think if anything is going to change, it\u2019s going to be now, it\u2019s going to be over the next couple of years,\u201d she says. \u201cEach story is different, each person is different and has to be understood in their own way, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, that\u2019s just another challenge that we have to face and we\u2019re up for it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough \u2013 it\u2019s not a quick fix, but the future is bright.\n\n\u201cI like to feel that I\u2019m giving something back to swimming and, hopefully, giving something to the Black community to hopefully achieve, strive for and change the way that Black people are viewed in swimming and the way Black people view swimming.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a double-edged sword; I absolutely love doing it. Sometimes, it\u2019s really frightening and daunting, but if I\u2019m trying to make the world a better place, then sometimes you got to step out and scare yourself.\u201d", "label": "human"}

Betr.\n\nSimplebet cofounder Joey Levy is banking that the \"idea of making every moment in a sporting event an accessible betting opportunity,\" which is known as microbetting, is the future of US sports betting.\n\nHis latest venture, Betr, which he founded with influencer and boxer Jake Paul, combines this breed of gambling with media in a new sports-betting app. Users can bet on how many free throws the next NBA player will make on their trip to the line, or if the New York Giants' first drive in this Saturday's game will be a touchdown, field goal, punt, or turnover.\n\nThe platform launched in September with a free-to-play experience, and began testing real-money betting in Ohio on January 1.\n\nIn December, Levy sat down with Insider to reflect on 2022 and speculate on the year ahead.\n\nLevy's 2022 prediction that came to fruition: \"A heightened focus on getting the unit economics back on track and focusing on profitability and sustainable growth ... reducing customer acquisitions spend, thinking through how to be more efficient and creating a path to profitability. That's something I predicted would happen because I felt like a lot of the customer-acquisition initiatives were unsustainable.\"\n\nOne thing he thought would happen in 2022 that didn't: \"I probably would've thought there would've been a little bit more M&A in 2022.

In 2023, all these things are going to ultimately come to a head.\n\nThere are some assets that candidly are going to run out of money in 2023-24 ... For the people that are sitting on healthy balance sheets that have clear path to profitability, there's going to be really interesting opportunities in M&A.\n\nI also think we'll see a lot of focus on product innovation.

{"text": "A temporary shelter in Woodlawn for recently arrived asylum seekers that has sparked controversy isn\u2019t expected to open up this week after all, according to Ald. Jeanette Taylor, whose 20th Ward includes the property.\n\nCity officials confirmed last week that the James Wadsworth Elementary School at 6420 S. University Ave., would be converted into a temporary shelter for newly arrived immigrants seeking asylum. A spokesperson for Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s office did not return requests seeking comment Thursday about the delayed opening.\n\nThe shelter, which had been slated to open Friday, will instead open at a later date to allow for another community forum, which residents had pushed for, Taylor said. The opening will also be contingent on the creation of a safety and security plan for in and around the property.\n\n\u201cI feel like my heart was in the ground,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s back in my chest.\u201d\n\nSince late August, Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has sent hundreds of asylum seekers to Democrat-led cities like Chicago. More than 3,850 asylum seekers had arrived on chartered buses from Texas as of last week, according to city officials. In addition, the city has provided services for 1,400 asylum seekers who have arrived to Chicago in recent months.\n\nIn a statement released Thursday, Lightfoot said the city was at \u201cmaximum capacity\u201d in housing and services for asylum seekers.\n\n\u201cThus, it would simply be inhumane for cities and states to continue sending migrants to Chicago. Treating migrants like freight must end. It is simply immoral,\u201d Lightfoot said in the prepared statement that did not address the Wadsworth property.\n\nWhile some Woodlawn residents completely oppose the shelter, others wanted the city to answer their questions, Taylor said.\n\n\u201cThis was imposed on us,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they came to the community or me.\u201d\n\nThe delay in opening means Taylor won\u2019t be joining residents who had planned to protest the shelter. Taylor had said there were concerns about the impact the shelter will have on Woodlawn residents and on the newly arrived asylum seekers who won\u2019t be near immigrant resources.\n\nJennifer Maddox, an aldermanic candidate for the 20th Ward, said she was not notified about the delayed opening, but other residents received an email late Wednesday from the city indicating the date had been pushed back to allow for another community meeting. Maddox was among a group of residents who had a news conference Thursday morning to air their concerns.\n\n\u201cWe just want the mayor to really come to Woodlawn to speak to the residents,\u201d Maddox said by phone Thursday afternoon. \u201cThey want to see her, they want to talk to her. They want her to answer herself reasons why she decided to do that.\u201d\n\nMaddox said she attended the community forum that was held in late December, but she walked away with few answers. One of her biggest concerns about the temporary shelter centers around safety.\n\nThere is also a sense that the Woodlawn community\u2019s call for resources is being ignored while funds are diverted to the community of newly arrived asylum seekers, she said. This has lead to residents feeling like they were \u201cslapped in the face\u201d or not good enough to receive the resources, Maddox said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not against migrants at all,\u201d Maddox said. \u201cBut we need to understand that there are an existing population of people that reside or are in the community that need some of the resources as well. We want to make sure it\u2019s equitable to all.\u201d\n\nCommunity concerns about the shelter come as Lightfoot has pushed for lawmakers to provide the city with more funding to assist the asylum seekers.

The company is contending with slowing sales, as predictions of a sustained post-Covid e-commerce boom didn't pan out. At the height of the pandemic, consumers came to depend on online retailers like Amazon for goods ranging from toilet paper and face masks to patio furniture. That drove Amazon's stock to record highs as sales soared.\n\nAs the economy reopened, consumers gradually returned to shopping in stores and spending on things like travel and restaurants, which caused Amazon's impressive revenue growth to fade. The situation only worsened at the start of this year, as the company confronted higher costs tied to inflation, the war in Ukraine and supply chain constraints.\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy, who succeeded founder Jeff Bezos at the helm in July 2021, admitted that the company hired too many workers and overbuilt its warehouse network as it raced to keep up with pandemic-era demand.

U.S. policy does not allow for the joint control of nuclear assets anywhere in the world.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"This is going to be done through a variety of ways, including as President Yoon said, through enhanced information-sharing, joint planning and expanding the range of contingencies that we plan for, as well as training, and with the idea eventually leading up to a tabletop exercise,\" the U.S. official told Reuters.\n\nThe timing of the planned exercises has not been finalised, but they would take place \"in the not-too-distant future\" and cover scenarios including but not limited to nuclear situations, the official said.\n\n\"The idea is to also try and make sure that we're able to fully think through the range of possibilities based on the DPRK capabilities which they've demonstrated, as well as their statements,\" that official added, using North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\n\nWhen asked about the tabletop exercises, a spokesperson for South Korea's defence ministry said talks were under way but declined to provide details.\n\nThe two countries have revived consultations on extended deterrence this year after a years-long hiatus while North Korea increased its nuclear and missile capability.\n\nPyongyang defined South Korea as an \"undoubted enemy\" and vowed to beef up its nuclear arsenal this year, after firing a record number of missiles in 2022 and fuelling tension by sending drones into the South in December.\n\n\"The U.S. countermeasures have not kept up with the North's advancing nuclear programmes, and the extended deterrence strategy is almost no different from when their nuclear capability was insignificant and weaker,\" said Go Myong-hyun, a research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul.\n\nBut Kim Dong-yup, a professor at Kyungnam University, said the comment from Biden, who has sole authority to authorise the use of U.S. nuclear weapons, suggests an American reluctance to share nuclear operations, given their sensitivity and security concerns.\n\n\"Given growing voices for tactical nuclear weapons, Washington could try to give reassurances and send more nuclear assets when we want, but they're unlikely to fully materialise President Yoon's push for greater extended deterrence,\" Kim said.\n\n(Reporting by Soo-hyang Choi and Hyonhee Shin in Seoul and Trevor Hunnicutt in Washington; Additional reporting by Simon Lewis and David Brunnstrom in Washington; Editing by Gerry Doyle and Stephen Coates)", "label": "human"}

Since its inception, the organization has grown to become a major player in the AI space, earning recognition for its achievements in advancing the field.\n\nOne of OpenAI's most notable developments is its AI-driven natural language processing system, GPT-3, which is currently the most powerful AI language model worldwide. GPT-3 has been utilized to create a variety of applications and services, ranging from generating movie scripts to creating artistic content.\n\nAccording to the WSJ, OpenAI is in talks with multiple potential investors for the tender offer, and it is believed that the company could raise up to $2 billion from the sale. If the discussions are successful, it would double the company's valuation, which currently stands at $15 billion.\n\nThe move would likely provide OpenAI with a much-needed financial boost to continue its work in the AI space and attract a range of new investors eager to participate in the AI revolution.\n\nIt is unclear at this time who the potential investors in the tender offer are or what their motivations might be.

A number of prominent AI startups, including Google's DeepMind, Facebook's Wit.ai, and Microsoft's AI Factory, have seen their valuations skyrocket in recent months.\n\nThe surge in AI startups' valuation is a reflection of the growing interest and demand for AI technologies, driven largely by the increasing reliance on AI to solve complex problems and automate mundane tasks.\n\nOpenAI's sale of its shares would also be a significant boost for the startup ecosystem in San Francisco, attracting new capital and investors to the area, which would be particularly beneficial for startups looking to expand their operations and take on more ambitious projects.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the discussions will result in a successful tender offer, but it is clear that OpenAI has made a significant impression in the tech world and is poised to become a major player in the AI space.

{"text": "The State of Illinois finds itself at a juncture regarding the disposal of surplus real estate. The imperative for supplementary revenue has been pressing for years, and state officials have contemplated selling off some surplus land to address these demands. However, the optimal approach to accomplish this task while ensuring that Illinoisans reap the benefits of the sale remains a topic of debate.\n\nThis conundrum has been a subject of discussion for years, with diverse opinions being presented by both sides of the aisle. The issue was recently brought to a head when the State of Illinois sold some of its surplus land to a private developer. The sale was met with outcry from many residents of the state, who argued that they had no say in the decision and felt that they weren\u2019t receiving a fair outcome.\n\nThe problem is that Illinois currently lacks a specific framework or guidelines to govern the disposal of its surplus land. This leaves the state vulnerable to allegations of favoritism or unsavory dealings in the sale of these properties. With the establishment of a well-defined set of guidelines, the state can ensure that any land sale is conducted in a transparent and equitable manner, while also ensuring that the generated revenue is allocated towards projects that benefit the entire state.\n\nTo this end, many in the state\u2019s legislative body are advocating for the creation of a new set of regulations that would govern the disposal of surplus land in Illinois. The proposed guidelines would require any interested buyer to submit a detailed proposal outlining the development plan for the land, the environmental benefits of the proposed use, and the economic benefits of the project for the region. The proposal would also include details on the amount of money the buyer is willing to pay for the land and how the funds generated from the sale would be utilized.\n\nOnce a proposal has been submitted, the state would review it and make a decision based on the merits of the plan. The decision would then be open to public comment, allowing citizens to express their opinion and ensure that the deal is both beneficial to the state and fair to the buyer. If the proposal is approved, the revenue generated from the sale would be allocated towards projects that directly benefit the state and its citizens.\n\nThis proposed set of guidelines has sparked debate in the legislative body, with some arguing that the rules are too stringent and could end up discouraging potential buyers from submitting bids for the surplus land. Others, however, feel that the rules will ensure that any land sale is conducted in a fair and transparent manner, while also ensuring that the generated revenue is allocated towards projects that benefit the state and its citizens.\n\nUltimately, it is up to Illinois legislators to determine whether the proposed guidelines are the correct approach. It is clear, however, that some action needs to be taken regarding the disposal of surplus land.

In Sacramento County, southeast of Fort Bragg's Mendocino County, crews used any pauses in the rain to work to repair levees south of the state capital that had been breached by the first of several anticipated waves of storms that began on New Year's Eve, leading to flooding that killed at least three people.\n\nIn the popular seaside village of Mendocino just south of Noyo Harbor, Big River Beach was unrecognizable under heaps of debris including trees that had been ripped from the ground by winds of up to 50 miles per hour. Foamy water ponded on the sand, and the briny smell of the ocean was more pungent than usual.\n\nWaves overnight in the area reached 33 feet, and winds reached 50 miles per hour. Waves of up to 30 feet were predicted for Thursday.\n\nAt the southern end of Mendocino county, the small towns of Point Arena and Gualala have been largely without power for around 24 hours. About 2,500 households and businesses were without power in the county, which is home to about 91,000 people.\n\nCalifornia's storied coast road, Highway 1, is closed in four places in Mendocino County because of fallen trees, the California Department of Transportation said. Fog, flooding and rock slides contributed to closures along the highway in other parts of the state.\n\nNo fishing boats were set to go out Thursday morning from Noyo Harbor, where small recreational boats and large commercial vessels have slips, and crab, rockfish and salmon are among the typical catches.\n\nThe high tide brought swells that washed debris across the beach and its parking lot, the high waves crashing into the mouth of the Noyo River.\n\nProfessional urchin diver Grant Downie, one of several gathered to check out the high water, said he\u2019d moved his boat out of the harbor ahead of the storm just to be safe.\n\nIt was insured, he said, but he'd rather risk its being hit by a falling tree than sinking in the wild water.\n\nReporting by Kate Fishman; additional reporting and writing by Sharon Bernstein; Editing by Donna Bryson and Leslie Adler\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "label": "human"}

Trump Tower Meeting: The documents show that investigators were particularly interested in the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between top Trump campaign officials and a Russian lawyer, providing a better understanding of why investigators were so interested in it.\n\n2. George Papadopoulos: The documents reveal that Papadopoulos, a former foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, repeatedly tried to arrange a meeting between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, making him the first person associated with the Trump campaign to be indicted by Mueller.\n\n3. Briefing and Debriefing of Key Witnesses: The documents show that Mueller's team conducted briefings and debriefings of key witnesses, and that investigators also conducted additional research on topics related to the investigation.\n\n4. Efforts to Obtain Russian Documents: The documents reveal that investigators sought to obtain documents from Russian nationals, including through the use of a grand jury subpoena.\n\n5. Attorney General Confirmation Hearing: The documents show that during the confirmation process of then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the investigation requested documents related to Sessions' involvement in the Trump campaign and any contact he had with Russia.\n\n6.

This trend is likely to have a profound impact on smaller companies, which may struggle to compete without being part of a larger entity.\n\nMeanwhile, the competition in the streaming space is expected to intensify, with streaming bundles and direct-to-consumer services becoming increasingly prevalent. The battle for subscribers will reach new heights as more streaming services enter the market, driving competition for exclusive content.\n\nExperts also anticipate a surge in competition for high-quality programming, with Disney's successful slate of exclusive shows serving as a catalyst. Netflix and Amazon are likely to respond by ramping up their original content production, matching Disney's moves in the coming year.\n\nSports-related content is also expected to undergo significant changes, with sports streaming rights becoming increasingly valuable. The launch of the NFL's new streaming service, NFLX, is expected to have a profound impact on the sports streaming landscape, giving the NFL significant leverage in negotiations with streaming services.\n\nAs the streaming landscape continues to evolve, experts predict that we will see a proliferation of innovative programming, including interactive shows that allow viewers to influence the story. This increased competition will make it challenging for established players to maintain their dominance, but it will also create opportunities for new players to emerge.\n\nUltimately, the experts agree that 2023 will be a year of significant transformation in the media landscape, with streaming becoming an increasingly important factor.

{"text": "Legal challenges now stand in the way of President Joe Biden\u2019s plan to cancel thousands of dollars in education loans for millions of Americans. As a professor focused on debt and inequality, I\u2019m rooting for the plan to succeed. But I\u2019m also concerned that it does nothing to address the problems in higher education that are scaring off a new generation of potential students.\n\nOver the past three and a half years, I have been talking with more than 30 low-income students and their families from across the country about their attitudes toward student debt and their paths after high school. Contrary to my expectations, many told me they were enrolling in inexpensive two-year colleges or eschewing higher education entirely.\n\nRead: What the student-loan debate overlooks\n\nThese interviews suggest that some families, forced to borrow money just to cover the basic cost of living, are not willing to borrow yet more money for educational reasons, even if it would give them access to skilled jobs and better salaries in the future. Their fear is rational under current circumstances.\n\nAs I traveled to different states, I met low-income high-school graduates like Olivia Hall, who grew up watching her mother struggle to pay off her loans and vowed not to fall into the same trap. Hall considered charging tuition to a credit card, rather than borrowing, but ultimately skipped college. She works at a sandwich shop now. Charlie Andry asked friends and family to donate to her GoFundMe campaign to save up money for the University of Illinois at Chicago, after turning down an offer from the more expensive Northwestern University to retain a few thousand dollars. Many others, such as Mia Mujaahid, are lured away from education by $17-an-hour jobs at warehouses and big-box stores.\n\nThe American higher-education system appears broken for all but the most well-off. Selective colleges are receiving more applications than ever before, fueling the impression that Americans of all sorts are aiming for the elite college experience. But the rise of applications is partly the result of the same students sending applications to more schools, as a recent report shows.\n\nAlready-stretched families hesitate to extend themselves more. Students who borrow for higher education but fail to complete their degrees struggle the most to pay back the money. This group includes disproportionately high numbers of people of color and low-income individuals. Among those enrolled full-time, 40 percent of Black students and 54 percent of Latino students do not attain bachelor\u2019s degrees within six years, compared with about two-thirds of white students. Almost half of students from families with incomes below $35,000 fail to graduate within the same period, compared with less than a third from families with incomes above $75,000. Students who drop out default on student loans at a rate three times higher than those who graduate. Families who fail to make payments on college debt risk their wages being garnished, their income-tax refunds being withheld, and their credit scores being lowered, which can make it difficult to obtain leases and can lead to higher interest rates on other loans.\n\nIn recent decades, the U.S. has made an attempt to narrow persistent race- and income-based inequalities in educational attainment by helping students of different backgrounds access loans. Now the Biden administration is trying to cancel some of that debt. But canceling existing student debt up to a specific amount does nothing to help new students apply to and attend universities that will give them the greatest odds of success.\n\nJosh Mitchell: A crimson tide of debt\n\nBefore 1965, most federal aid was given directly to colleges and not to students. Historically, states issued more assistance to postsecondary institutions and students than the federal government did. In 1990, states\u2019 per-student funding was almost 140 percent more than that of the federal government, according to research by the Pew Charitable Trusts. But in recent years, the amount of funding supplied by states has dropped. States should increase direct funding levels.\n\nThe pandemic has exposed and perpetuated inequalities in higher education. Americans can no longer pretend that trying to equalize college access with postcollege approaches will be sufficient. Families desperately need the hope and opportunity that education provides. That starts with recognizing their unwillingness to take on debt.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "How our perception of time shapes our approach to climate change\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rebecca Blackwell/AP Rebecca Blackwell/AP\n\nMost people are focused on the present: today, tomorrow, maybe next year. Fixing your flat tire is more pressing than figuring out if you should use an electric car. Living by the beach is a lot more fun than figuring out when your house will be underwater because of sea level rise.\n\nThat basic human relationship with time makes climate change a tricky problem.\n\n\"I consider climate change the policy problem from hell because you almost couldn't design a worse fit for our underlying psychology, or our institutions of decision-making,\" says Anthony Leiserowitz, the director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.\n\nOur obsession with the present obscures the future\n\nThose institutions \u2014 including companies and governments that ultimately have the power to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 can be even more obsessed with the present than individuals are.\n\nFor example, says Leiserowitz, many companies are focused on quarterly earnings and growth. That helps drive short-term behavior, such as leasing new land to drill for fossil fuels, that makes long-term climate change worse.\n\nAnd there are also big incentives for political leaders to think short-term. \"The President gets elected every four years. Members of the Senate get elected every six years. And members of the House get elected every two years,\" Leiserowitz points out, \"so they tend to operate on a much shorter time cycle than this problem, climate change, which is unfolding over decades.\"\n\nThere are deadlines looming for those elected leaders. The Biden administration pledged to cut emissions in half by 2030. By 2050, humans need to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions entirely in order to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change later this century.\n\nFortunately, our collective focus on the present also offers hints, psychologists say, about how to harness that hyperfocus on the present to inspire action.\n\nTo spur action, speed up the psychological rewards for addressing climate change now\n\nFor example, there are ways to highlight the quick payoff for addressing climate change. In the political realm, that could mean that an elected official gets more votes because they support policies that reduce emissions. The promise of a benefit in the next election may be more galvanizing than the goal of protecting future generations, even if the latter has more moral weight.\n\n\"The benefits that we get today are more salient, and we want them more than benefits that may be larger, but will accrue in the future,\" explains Jennifer Jacquet, a researcher and associate professor of environmental studies at New York University who studies the psychology of collective action, including on climate change.\n\nJacquet says the huge spending bill passed last year by Congress, called the Inflation Reduction Act, is another example of using our focus on the present to drive climate-conscious behavior. The bill includes financial incentives for people who buy electric vehicles or install solar panels.\n\n\"They're trying to speed up the benefits,\" says Jacquet. \"That's smart. That's good. That plays into how we think about things.\"\n\nExtreme weather is starting to catch everyone's attention\n\nIn some ways, our focus on the present is less and less of a problem as climate change makes itself more and more obvious today \u2014 in our daily lives. Everyone on Earth is experiencing the effects of a hotter planet. That makes it a problem of the present, not of the future.\n\nThat immediacy is already showing up in how Americans view climate change, according to Leiserowitz, who has been leading an annual poll on the topic for more than 15 years. As extreme weather is becoming more common, he says support for climate policies is also growing, especially at the local level.\n\nFor example, the vast majority of respondents in a September 2021 poll said they support local governments providing money to help make homes more energy efficient, to increase public transportation and to install bike lanes. And the majority of respondents supported investments in renewable energy.\n\nThere's no time to waste\n\nWidespread public support for climate policies can help push politicians and corporate leaders to act quickly \u2013 which is important, because scientists warn that greenhouse gas emissions need to drop dramatically, and immediately, to avoid runaway warming later this century.\n\n\"We have big societal choices to make,\" says Leiserowitz, and those changes need to happen now. In the present. \"People working together to demand action by their leaders is going to be an absolutely critical piece.\"\n\nThis story is part of our periodic science series \"Finding Time \u2014 taking a journey through the fourth dimension to learn what makes us tick.\"", "label": "human"}

{"text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Even as the House GOP leadership keeps silent, a veteran Republican lawmaker said Sunday that George Santos should consider resigning after the congressman-elect from New York admitted to lying about his heritage, education and professional career.\n\nTexas Rep. Kevin Brady, a former House Ways and Means chairman who has served in Congress for 25 years, told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that Santos would have \u201cto take some huge steps\u201d to regain trust and respect in his district. Santos is set to be sworn in Tuesday when the new Congress begins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is troubling in so many ways. Certainly, he\u2019s lied repeatedly,\u201d said Brady, who is retiring from the House. \u201cHe certainly is going to have to consider resigning.\u201d Brady said a decision about whether Santos steps down is one \u201cto be made between he and the voters who elected him.\u201d\n\nIn November, Santos, 34, was elected in the 3rd Congressional District, which includes some Long Island suburbs and a small part of the New York City borough of Queens. He became the first non-incumbent, openly gay Republican to win a seat to Congress. But weeks after helping Republicans secure their razor-thin House majority, Santos is now under investigation for fabricating large swaths of his biography. His campaign spending is also being scrutinized.\n\nHe has shown no signs of stepping aside. Last week, Santos was asked on Fox News about the \u201cblatant lies\u201d and responded that he had \u201cmade a mistake.\u201d\n\nThe top House Republican, Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, who is running to become House speaker now that the GOP will hold the majority, has not said what action, if any, he might take against Santos.\n\nBrady said if he headed a committee that Santos was set to serve on, \u201cright now, he would not be on the committee.\u201d\n\nThe congressman also said that \u201cwe\u2019re a country of second chances.

{"text": "A prominent digital asset trading platform, widely regarded as a benchmark for the industry, has witnessed a significant decline in its stock value amidst a broader market downturn. The downturn has been attributed to the sudden collapse of a rival digital asset exchange, which filed for bankruptcy after an internal investigation revealed the misappropriation of over $1 billion in customer funds. The collapse of this major exchange has raised concerns about a potential contagion effect on other digital asset exchanges.\n\nThe affected platform's shares have been particularly impacted by the news, as investors fear that the company may be negatively affected by the fallout from the collapse. The platform is seen as a bellwether for the industry, and its movements are often taken as an indicator of the overall health of the market.\n\nAnalysts are divided on the potential impact of the collapse on the affected platform, with some arguing that its size and diversified operations will insulate it from the risk of contagion, while others believe that the entire industry is at risk and that the current stock price reflects that risk.\n\nIn an effort to alleviate investor concerns, the platform has released a statement outlining measures it is taking to protect its customers and business. These measures include enhanced security protocols, additional customer due diligence, and improved internal controls and monitoring systems. The company has also emphasized that its operations and customer assets remain safe and that it is committed to ensuring the security of its platform.\n\nDespite these efforts, however, many investors remain skeptical, and the stock has continued to decline. Meanwhile, competitors have been quick to capitalize on the opportunity, launching new products and features that have attracted new customers. The future of the affected platform remains uncertain, and it is unclear how it will fare in the long run. In the short term, however, investors appear reluctant to take a chance on the company, as fears of contagion continue to weigh on the stock.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The digital health sector has witnessed rapid growth in recent years, with tremendous potential for further expansion. A prominent digital health investor is predicting that a major tech giant, possibly Amazon or Salesforce, will make a significant move to acquire a substantial collection of patient health records within the next year.\n\nRick Franklin, a partner at HighCape, a venture firm specializing in digital health investments, discussed the future of digital health and the potential for a major tech company to acquire a vast repository of patient health records.\n\n\"We anticipate that in 2023, one of the tech giants \u2013 be it Amazon, Salesforce, or another \u2013 will enter the digital health space in a substantial manner and make a notable acquisition,\" Franklin stated. \"We're specifically focusing on patient health records, as they are the lifeblood of the healthcare industry and could provide a tech giant with a wealth of data that could then be utilized to drive the advancement of digital health solutions.\"\n\nFranklin explained that, while numerous digital health companies have emerged over the past few years, it has become increasingly challenging for these startups to gain access to the data they require to develop their solutions. This has led to a bottleneck in the development of digital health solutions, and Franklin believes that this can be resolved by one of the major tech companies acquiring a substantial collection of patient health records.\n\n\"A tech giant such as Amazon or Salesforce could utilize the data to build a more comprehensive platform to enable better and more accurate diagnoses, treatments, and disease prevention,\" Franklin stated. \"They could use the data to develop digital health solutions that are more accurate and effective, allowing for better and more personalized healthcare outcomes.\"\n\nFranklin believes that the acquisition of a large collection of patient health records could also serve as a stepping stone for the tech giant to expand into the healthcare sector. He believes that, by providing access to patient data, the tech giants would be able to create a platform for healthcare professionals to better serve their patients, as well as enabling digital health solutions to reach a larger number of people.\n\nFranklin further noted that the acquisition of patient health records by one of the major tech companies could also help to reduce healthcare costs, by providing greater access to data and more accurate treatments.\n\n\"The acquisition of patient data will enable healthcare providers to make better and more cost-effective decisions,\" Franklin stated. \"It could also enable healthcare providers to quickly identify and treat patients who are at risk of developing certain diseases, which would lead to a better quality of care and ultimately, lower healthcare costs.\"\n\nIn summary, Franklin believes that the potential acquisition of a large collection of patient health records by one of the major tech companies could lead to numerous positive outcomes for the healthcare industry, including greater access to data, better treatments, and lower healthcare costs.\n\n\"If done correctly, the acquisition of patient health records could be a major step forward for digital health,\" Franklin stated. \"It could enable digital health solutions to become more prevalent and help to bring about better and more cost-effective healthcare outcomes.\"", "label": "machine"}

Getty Images\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Friday granted accelerated approval for the Alzheimer's drug lecanemab, the second treatment from Biogen and its Japanese partner Eisai to receive an early green light in less than two years. The FDA's approval comes after clinical trial results published in November indicated that lecanemab slows cognitive decline somewhat in people with mild impairment due to Alzheimer's disease, but the treatment also carries risks of brain swelling and bleeding. Eisai, which led the development of lecanemab, is pricing the treatment at $26,500 per year in the U.S. It will be sold under the name Leqembi.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe FDA can accelerate approval of a drug to quickly bring it to market if it's expected to help patients suffering from serious conditions more than what is currently available. Biogen and Eisai applied for accelerated approval in July. \"Alzheimer's disease immeasurably incapacitates the lives of those who suffer from it and has devastating effects on their loved ones,\" said Dr. Billy Dunn, director of the FDA's neuroscience division, in a statement. \"This treatment option is the latest therapy to target and affect the underlying disease process of Alzheimer's, instead of only treating the symptoms of the disease.\" More than 6.5 million people in the U.S. suffer from Alzheimer's. The irreversible disease destroys memory, thinking skills, and eventually the ability to carry out simple tasks. The decision on lecanameb comes after Congress issued a scathing report last week about how the FDA handled the controversial approval of another Alzheimer's drug developed by Biogen and Eisai, called Aduhelm. The 2021 approval of that treatment, which experts said did not show a clear clinical benefit, was \"rife with irregularities,\" according to the report. The congressional report said the \"FDA must take swift action to ensure that its processes for reviewing future Alzheimer's disease treatments do not lead to the same doubts about the integrity of FDA's review.\"\n\nModestly slows disease\n\nLecanemab is a monoclonal antibody that targets a protein called amyloid which builds up on the brain in people with Alzheimer's. The antibody is administered intravenously every two weeks in doses determined by a patient's body weight with 10 milligrams given per kilogram. The FDA approved lecanemab based on the reduction of amyloid plaque observed in clinical trial participants who received the treatment, according to a statement from the agency. Participants who did not receive the treatment, the placebo arm, had no reduction in amyloid plaque. The clinical trial results, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that cognitive decline was 27% slower over 18 months in people who received lecanemab compared with those who did not receive the treatment. The study was funded by Biogen and Eisai. Cognitive decline was measured using a system called the clinical dementia rating, which is an 18-point scale with a higher score indicating a greater level of impairment. It measures cognitive functions such as memory, judgement and problem solving. Alzheimer's disease progressed 1.21 points on average in the group that received lecanemab compared with 1.66 points in the group that did not receive the treatment, a modest difference of 0.45 points. Nearly 1,800 people ages 50 to 90 years old with early Alzheimer's participated in the trial, about half of whom received lecanemab and half of whom did not.\n\nSafety concerns", "label": "human"}

{"text": "A version of this story appears in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nIt\u2019s a very small minority of a slim majority that\u2019s kept the House from moving forward and is on the cusp of derailing Rep. Kevin McCarthy\u2019s bid to become speaker.\n\nThey don\u2019t speak for the majority of Republicans. The 20 anti-McCarthy Republicans who so far derailed his bid to become House speaker represent less than 10% of the House GOP.\n\nThey aren\u2019t the entirety of the Freedom Caucus. The hardliners are less than half the ultraconservative, ultra-MAGA wing of lawmakers.\n\nThey\u2019re sort of gaining support. Rep. Victoria Spartz of Indiana became the 21st Republican member-elect to not support McCarthy on Wednesday, although she voted \u201cpresent\u201d rather than voting for anyone.\n\nThe hardliners also don\u2019t speak with one voice.\n\n\u201cI think you need to break the 20 down,\u201d the conservative Republican Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado said on CNN on Wednesday. Buck had been viewed as a possible defector before this week, and he made clear that patience with these votes is waning.\n\nHe suggested McCarthy\u2019s deputy, Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, as a possible consensus speaker who could speak to three varieties of the 20 anti-McCarthy Republicans.\n\nFor some, it\u2019s personal. \u201cThere are a few of those 20 that just aren\u2019t going to vote for Kevin McCarthy but would vote for somebody else,\u201d Buck said. The key question is whether that block of \u201cnever-McCarthy\u201d House Republicans is larger than the four votes McCarthy can afford to lose.\n\nOthers want specific changes. \u201cThere are some of the others \u2026 who want changes in the rules and there are some others who care about policy,\u201d Buck said. \u201cSo I think if Steve (Scalise) meets those three needs, he will be able to move forward and take the speakership.\u201d\n\nSome want to shut things down. Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina has said a non-negotiable for him is if McCarthy is \u201cwilling to shut the government down rather than raising the debt ceiling.\u201d That suggests the kind of precarious future funding fights will pose to the economy.\n\nThese lawmakers want painful cuts now to end deficit spending. If the US was to default on its debt, it could send the US economy into a tailspin, according to most economists. A government shutdown would be less severe, but they have been unpopular when lawmakers forced them in recent years.\n\nHere are some of the stated reasons and accepted motivations of why these lawmakers are unwilling to support McCarthy.\n\nThis public fight on the House floor is part of what they wanted\n\n\u201cWe are showing the American people that this process works,\u201d said the Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Scott Perry in rising to nominate Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida as an alternative to McCarthy. That it\u2019s been 100 years since there was such a floor fight is a feature of the moment, Perry argued. \u201cWe have said we are not going to take any more of Washington being broken.\u201d\n\nThat was echoed by another anti-McCarthy Republican who appeared on CNN, Rep. Dan Bishop of North Carolina.\n\n\u201cI really think this is democracy in action,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not satisfied with Washington as it is, then you can\u2019t be satisfied with doing the same thing as we start this Congress, I\u2019m convinced.\u201d\n\nSome just don\u2019t like McCarthy\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz of Florida issued a personal screed against McCarthy on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cMaybe the right person for the speaker of the House isn\u2019t someone who has sold shares in himself for more than a decade to get it,\u201d Gaetz said, standing just in front of his target.\n\nBishop was less aggressive on CNN when he expressed the problem with McCarthy\u2019s specific leadership.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that you never see a specific agenda that you know Kevin McCarthy\u2019s going to go to the mat for, as opposed to sort of pablum or poll-tested language, indicates the problem,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been that way for all 14 years he\u2019s been in leadership, with all due respect to him.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re not going to follow Donald Trump on this\n\nAfter McCarthy developed amnesia about the January 6, 2021, insurrection and repeatedly paid tribute to Donald Trump, the former president has been trying to help McCarthy out. But the effort has not helped, according to Rep. Lauren Boebert, the Colorado Republican.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s stop with the campaign smears and tactics to get people to turn against us \u2013 even having my favorite president call us and tell us we need to knock this off,\u201d Boebert said on the House floor on Wednesday. \u201cI think it actually needs to be reversed. The president needs to tell Kevin McCarthy that, sir, you do not have the votes and it\u2019s time to withdraw.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s very much about the perceived swamp\n\nIf you watch enough Tucker Carlson on Fox or listen to Steve Bannon\u2019s podcast, you\u2019ll hear the argument that Republicans and Democrats aren\u2019t that different. Carlson often uses the term \u201cuni-party\u201d to blast the funding bills that are signed into law. There\u2019s some of that in the opposition to McCarthy, who has been part of the GOP leadership for years.\n\n\u201cRight now I\u2019m holding the line because I think we need this place to operate differently, and that\u2019s not a partisan statement. It\u2019s just something that I believe,\u201d Rep. Chip Roy of Texas told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Tuesday.\n\nRoy said he\u2019s among the fiscal conservatives who want to \u201cstop the train of the swamp,\u201d which he said is made up of Republicans and Democrats, \u201cpower brokers and the defense industrial complex.\u201d He argued that the special interests come together to push government funding bills like the $1.7 trillion version passed last month to fund the government through most of 2023.\n\nThey want more power for individual members\n\nRoy and Perry also talked about the need for open amendments on the House floor, and Donalds has joined the others who want a single member to be able to force a vote on whether to remove a sitting speaker.\n\nSpartz hasn\u2019t opposed McCarthy, but she didn\u2019t do him any favors when she voted \u201cpresent\u201d and ate away at his support. She said on CNN on Wednesday that the hardliners have a point about open debate and the amendment process and she wants the House to function differently.\n\n\u201cWe have uncontrolled spending, and we can do nothing about it,\u201d Spartz complained, noting the appropriations process does not allow for open amendments. \u201cI think that needs to stop,\u201d she said.\n\nThey may never be satisfied\n\nMcCarthy did offer numerous concessions to the hardliners like Roy, including a pledge \u2013 which seems impossible given the slapdash way legislation comes together \u2013 to give lawmakers 72 hours to read a bill before it goes to the floor for a vote.\n\nHe also agreed to allow just five Republicans to force a vote to remove the speaker instead of the current requirement that a majority of Republicans join the call.\n\nOne complication with finding a McCarthy replacement is that someone like Scalise might realize how much more difficult McCarthy\u2019s concessions will make the job.\n\nWhen CNN\u2019s Manu Raju and Veronica Stracqualursi asked Donalds, who has been getting votes from the hardliners Wednesday, if he wanted the job, he said, \u201cNah, not really.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s context to these demands\n\nIt\u2019s not entirely true that zero people read these spending bills or that no one can influence what goes into them.\n\nCongressional leaders rely on committees to hash out the vast majority of what goes into the spending bills. Members can request individual spending items. It\u2019s a complicated process and pretty much everyone agrees it is flawed.\n\nOn the other hand, those who want open amendments to spending bills would almost surely use them to poison the process.\n\nIn other words, once this small minority of lawmakers got the power they crave to blow up spending bills, they would.\n\n\u201cThis is a prelude of what\u2019s going to come and the coming attraction when we get up to any big budget matter or the debt ceiling or anything else,\u201d Rep. David Joyce of Ohio, a McCarthy-backer, said on CNN on Wednesday. \u201cThere will be a crowd and they\u2019re going to continue to push and shove what they think is the agenda, and they\u2019re 10% of our whole conference.\u201d\n\nDoing the larger math, 10% of the GOP conference is a much smaller minority of the will of voters.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Blue Box\n\nNow this one I found all on my own! Please clap. So hear me out: I usually don\u2019t read sports manga week to week. And romance manga that gives me a twinge of Nisekoi\u2019s endless harem vibes usually goes straight to the bin that\u2019s auspiciously labeled \u201cguilty pleasures.\u201d But Blue Box is a manga I can say with my full chest is one of the better sports/romance stories I\u2019ve read this year. Blue Box, created by Kouji Miura, follows the blossoming romance between two junior high athletes named Taiki Inomata and Chinatsu Kano. Chinatsu and Taiki\u2019s will-they-won\u2019t-they romance is neatly accentuated by how determined they are while training and competing for their respective championships. Because Blue Box is still a romance manga, the pair\u2019s blossoming romance is complicated by the one-two punch of them having to live together, and their tenuous, one-on-one dynamic turning into a love triangle with the inclusion of Taiki\u2019s best friend, Hina Chouno.\n\nAlthough it occasionally skirts the line of being a full-blown cliche harem romance manga, it consistently sets itself apart with how emotionally mature its characters are. Despite being junior high schoolers, all three characters are acutely aware that they\u2019re initially in love with the idea of being with the person they\u2019ve got a crush on, without really knowing them as people first. While the manga is filled with comedic and dramatic misinterpretations and misunderstandings between the trio, it also takes them to task whenever they project their feelings onto each other, which is a really refreshing change of pace for romance manga. Also, the sports in question in this manga are basketball, something I\u2019ve really gotten into this year, and badminton, a high-key slept-on sport in both real life and fiction.", "label": "human"}

Amazon falls on ugly forecast and slowest growth since dot-com bust\n\nAndy Jassy, CEO of Amazon and then CEO of Amazon Web Services, speaks at the WSJD Live conference in Laguna Beach, California, October 25, 2016. Mike Blake | Reuters\n\nAmazon dropped more than 10% in the premarket, following its late Thursday announcement of weaker-than-expected first-quarter earnings and lower forward guidance. Revenue for the quarter increased 7% year over year to $116.4 billion, basically matching expectations. That was the slowest sales rise for any quarter since the dot-com bust in 2001 and the second straight quarter of single-digit percentage growth. The Amazon Web Services cloud unit was once again strong. But not strong enough to carry the e-commerce side of the business, which saw $6 billion in added costs due to rising inflation, lower worker productivity and excess fulfillment capacity.\n\n3. Apple drops after warning of a massive hit due to supply constraints\n\nTim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple Inc., speaks during the Peek Performance virtual event in New York, U.S., on Tuesday, March 8, 2022. Gabby Jones | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nApple fell 1% in Friday's premarket, the morning after warning that supply constraints related to Covid could hurt sales by between $4 billion and $8 billion in its fiscal third quarter. The guidance overshadowed strong fiscal second-quarter results, including earnings, revenue and gross margin beats. While analysts were looking for a little bit more out of the Services segment, it nonetheless reported record revenue. Products sales saw a March-quarter record. Investors also got a 5% dividend increase and a $90 billion buyback authorization. At quarter end, Apple had a $73 billion net cash position.\n\n4. Musk sells around $4 billion of Tesla shares as he moves to buy Twitter\n\nElon Musk sold roughly $4 billion worth of Tesla shares in the days following his $44 billion bid to take Twitter private, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The bulk of the CEO's sales were made on Tuesday, the filings showed. Tesla shares fell 12% that day, but edged higher on Wednesday by less than 1 percentage point. As the filings became public Thursday evening, Musk wrote on Twitter, \"No further TSLA sales planned after today.\" Tesla's stock rose 2% in Friday's premarket. Twitter shares climbed nearly 1% to more than $49 each, below the $54.20 per-share cash offer from Musk.\n\n5.

Chevron's revenue rose nearly 70% to $54.37 billion. West Texas Intermediate crude futures spiked to $130.50 in early March, a price last seen in 2008 as Russia's invasion of Ukraine sparked supply fears.

{"text": "The United States' personal savings rate has been consistently decreasing over the years, with the latest report from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis indicating a near-record low of 6.4%. This decline is likely attributed to the increasing cost of retirement, leaving many Americans struggling to make ends meet.\n\nHowever, the US Senate is working to address this issue. Led by Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Senate is poised to pass the Retirement Security for Americans Act of 2022, which aims to provide various incentives and benefits to encourage Americans to save for retirement.\n\nThe Act proposes several tax incentives to promote retirement savings. It offers a tax credit of up to $2,500 for individuals who contribute to IRAs or 401(k)s, as well as an income-tax deduction of up to $2,500 for contributions to Roth IRAs and Simplified Employee Pension Plans. Additionally, individuals over 50 can make \"catch-up\" contributions of up to $3,000 to their retirement accounts.\n\nThe bill also makes it easier for employers to establish automatic enrollment in retirement plans, allowing them to contribute up to 5% of an employee's salary to their retirement plan. This would enable workers to save for retirement, even if they don't prioritize it or don't have the means to do so.\n\nFurthermore, the Act provides tax incentives for individuals who use their 401(k)s to purchase annuities. An annuity is an insurance product that provides a steady income for life, regardless of one's lifespan. By offering tax incentives for annuities, the Act makes it easier and less expensive for people to secure a steady income in retirement.\n\nThe Act also introduces a new savings bond, the \"Retirement Security Bond,\" which offers a higher return than traditional savings accounts and certificates of deposit, and is exempt from state and local taxes. This would enable individuals to save for retirement without worrying about tax liabilities.\n\nLastly, the Act establishes a new government agency, the Retirement Savings Board, responsible for overseeing retirement plans and ensuring that employers provide adequate retirement benefits. This would guarantee that employers offer sufficient retirement benefits and that they are properly managed and monitored.\n\nThe Retirement Security for Americans Act of 2022 is a comprehensive piece of legislation that could have a significant impact on the lives of millions of Americans. If passed, it could help Americans save more for retirement, providing them with peace of mind in their later years. As Senator Warren emphasized, \"This is the kind of progressive, pro-savings legislation that Americans need right now.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Passengers are seen in the arrivals area for international flights at the Capital International Airport in Beijing on January 8, 2023.\n\nAfter years of separation from his wife in mainland China, Hong Kong resident Cheung Seng-bun made sure to be among the first in line following the reopening Sunday of border crossing points.\n\nThe ability of residents of the semi-autonomous southern Chinese city to cross over is one of the most visible signs of China's easing of border restrictions imposed almost three years ago, with travelers arriving from abroad no longer required to undergo expensive and time-consuming quarantines.\n\nThat comes even as the virus continues to spread in China amid what critics say is a lack of transparency from Beijing.\n\n\"I'm hurrying to get back to her,\" Cheung, lugging a heavy suitcase, told The Associated Press as he prepared to cross at Lok Ma Chau station, which was steadily filling with eager travelers.\n\nThose crossing between Hong Kong and mainland China, however, are still required to show a negative COVID-19 test taken within the last 48 hours \u2014 a measure China has protested when imposed by other countries.\n\nHong Kong has been hit hard by the virus, and its land and sea border checkpoints with the mainland have been largely closed for almost three years. Despite the risk of new infections, the reopening that will allow tens of thousands of people who have made prior online bookings to cross each day is expected to provide a much-needed boost to Hong Kong's tourism and retail sectors.\n\nOn a visit to the station Sunday morning, Hong Kong's Chief Executive John Lee said the sides would continue to expand the number of crossing points from the current seven to the full 14.\n\n\"The goal is to get back as quickly as possible to the pre-epidemic normal life,\" Lee told reporters. \"We want to get cooperation between the two sides back on track.\"\n\nCommunist Party newspaper Global Times quoted Tan Luming, a port official in Shenzhen on the border with Hong Kong, saying about 200 passengers were expected to take the ferry to Hong Kong, while another 700 were due to travel in the other direction, on the first day of reopening. Tan said a steady increase in passenger numbers is expected over coming days.\n\n\"I stayed up all night and got up at 4 a.m. as I'm so excited to return to the mainland to see my 80-year-old mother,\" a Hong Kong woman identified only by her surname, Cheung, said on arrival at Shenzhen, where she was presented with \"roses and health kits,\" the paper said.\n\nHong Kong media reports said around 300,000 travel bookings from the city to mainland China have already been made, with a daily quota of 60,000.\n\nLimited ferry service also was restored from China's Fujian province to the Taiwanese-controlled island of Kinmen just off the Chinese coast.\n\nThe border crossing with Russia at Suifenhe in the far northern province of Heilongjiang also resumed normal operations, just in time for the opening of the ice festival in the capital of Harbin, a major tourism draw.\n\nAnd at Ruili, on the border with Myanmar, normal operations were resumed after 1,012 days of full or partial closure in response to repeated outbreaks blamed partly on visitors from China's neighbor.\n\nSo far, only a fraction of the previous number of international flights are arriving at major Chinese airports.\n\nBeijing's main Capital International Airport was expecting eight flights from overseas on Sunday. Shanghai, China's largest city, received its first international flight under the new policy at 6:30 a.m. with only a trickle of others to follow.\n\nSince March 2020, all international passenger flights bound for Beijing have been diverted to designated first points of entry into China. Passengers were required to quarantine up to three weeks.\n\n\"I've been under isolated quarantine for six times in different cities (in mainland China),\" said Ivan Tang, a Hong Kong business traveler. \"They were not easy experiences.\"\n\nMing Guanghe, a Chinese living in Singapore, said it had been difficult both to book a ticket and find somewhere to take a PCR test. Quarantine measures and uncertainty about outbreaks had kept him away from home, Ming said.\n\nShanghai announced it would again start issuing regular passports to Chinese for foreign travel and family visits, as well as renewing and extending visas for foreigners. Those restrictions have had a particularly devastating effect on foreign businesspeople and students in the key Asian financial center.\n\nChina is now facing a surge in cases and hospitalizations in major cities and is bracing for a further spread into less developed areas with the start of its most important holiday, the Lunar New Year, in coming days.\n\nAuthorities say they expect domestic rail and air journeys will double over the same period last year, bringing overall numbers close to those of the 2019 holiday period before the pandemic hit.\n\nMeanwhile, more foreign governments are imposing testing requirements on travelers from China \u2014 most recently Germany, Sweden and Portugal. On Saturday, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock urged citizens to avoid \"unnecessary\" travel to China, noting the rise in coronavirus cases and China's \"overburdened\" health system.\n\nThe German regulation also allows for spot checks on arrival. Germany, like other European nations, will test wastewater from aircrafts for possible new virus variants. The measures come into force at midnight Monday and are due to last until April 7.\n\nApparently concerned about its reputation, China says the testing requirements aren't science-based and has threatened unspecified countermeasures.\n\nChinese health authorities publish a daily count of new infections, severe cases and fatalities, but those numbers include only officially confirmed cases and use a very narrow definition of COVID-19-related deaths.\n\nThe National Health Commission on Sunday reported 7,072 new confirmed cases of local transmission and two new deaths \u2014 even as individual provinces were reporting as many as 1 million cases per day.\n\nAuthorities say that since the government ended compulsory testing and permitted people with mild symptoms to test themselves and convalesce at home, it can no longer provide a full picture of the outbreak. China's vulnerabilities are increased by the population's general lack of exposure to the virus and a relatively low vaccination rate among the elderly.\n\nGovernment spokespeople insist the situation is under control and reject accusations from the World Health Organization and others that they're not being transparent about the outbreak that could lead to the emergence of new variants.\n\nThe Health Commission on Saturday rolled out regulations for strengthened monitoring of viral mutations, including testing of urban wastewater. The rules called for increased data gathering from hospitals and local government health departments and stepped-up checks on \"pneumonia of unknown causes.\"\n\nCriticism has largely focused on heavy-handed enforcement of regulations, including open-ended travel restrictions that saw people confined to their homes for weeks, sometimes sealed inside without adequate food or medical care.\n\nAnger was also vented over the requirement that anyone who potentially tested positive or had been in contact with such a person be confined for observation in a field hospital, where overcrowding, poor food and hygiene were commonly cited.\n\nThe social and economic costs eventually prompted rare street protests in Beijing and other cities, possibly influencing the Communist Party's decision to swiftly ease the strictest measures.", "label": "human"}

Lindsey Graham is one. There's New York Rep. Elise Stefanik. Ohio Sen.-elect J.D. Vance and Wyoming Rep.-elect Harriet Hageman both opposed Trump before accepting his endorsements.\n\nDespite Trump's clear power, though, there are signs of weakness: many of his endorsees lost in the midterms. A majority of Republican voters want someone else as the nominee in 2024. And then there's the fact he is the subject of multiple high-level investigations at the moment.\n\nAll of which raises a big question for the GOP: is Trump still the leader of the party?\n\nThat made this the perfect time to talk to Tim Miller, author of Why We Did It: A Travelogue On The Republican Road To Hell \u2014 our latest selection for the NPR Politics Podcast Book Club.\n\nTim is a former Republican operative who defected from the party over his objections to Trump. His book is a Washington insider's exploration of how the Republican elite fell in line under Trump, despite many of them privately claiming they opposed him.\n\nThe NPR Politics Podcast Belonging, Money, Duty? Inside Account Of Why GOP Pros Backed Trump Belonging, Money, Duty? Inside Account Of Why GOP Pros Backed Trump Listen \u00b7 20:59 20:59\n\nThe interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nDanielle Kurtzleben: Let's start with I suppose a pretty D.C. question \u2014 I'm going to ask you for your resume. Tell us about your background in Republican politics. What were you doing up until Trump's election, and what are you doing now?\n\nTim Miller: I grew up in Colorado, and I started as a young high school kid being a political nerd. And I just had the privilege and the luck to have a neighbor that was friends with a guy that was running for governor \u2014 his name was Bill Owens. And so in the summer, when other kids had to flip burgers or whatever, I went and interned on his campaign. He ends up winning a really, really close race that just kind of got me hooked on politics.\n\nI end up getting to go to the governor's office, and my task is to read his mail and sift through all the crazy letters that get sent to the governor's office.\n\nI [began] working on campaigns in a bunch of states, leading up to being a spokesperson on John McCain's Iowa presidential campaign. From there, I worked on a bunch of what would now be extinct, moderate RINO Republican presidential campaigns. [I was] a spokesperson for Jon Huntsman in 2012. And then after he lost, I begged my way into representing Mitt [Romney] at the RNC during the general election.\n\nThen in 2016, I was communications director for Jeb Bush's campaign before speaking for the first kind of Republicans against Trump PAC, which was called Our Principles PAC.\n\nAnd then, I don't know if you recall, but Donald Trump ends up winning, and I have a life crisis. Since then, I have been writing \u2014 I wrote for The Bulwark and other places. And I also was political director for Republican Voters Against Trump, which is a project aimed at getting Republicans to vote for Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nDK: You write early on that you knew this book would be cathartic for some liberals \u2014 to just read a dunkfest on top Trump officials. What were you hoping people would get from this book, if not just the joy of dunks?\n\nTM: I want to caveat that that was actually the original idea for the book, was to just tomahawk dunk on everyone. An agent came to me and said, \"I think you'd be really good at this book.\" You know, \"Write 'the ten slimiest grifters in Republican Washington' or whatever, and we'll sell a million copies.\"\n\nThat didn't feel like that was going to be satisfying for me on the writing side of things. And so while there is a little bit of that for sure, what I really wanted to do was focus more on the gray areas.\n\nI jumped over a couple of things, going over my resume, things that I'm less proud of: as a gay Republican, how I worked for candidates that opposed the most important thing in my life right now \u2014 my husband and child.\n\n[I wanted to] write about the people who saw the danger and went along with it anyway and tried to explore why they did, and I tried to explore why I got as far down that path as I did, even though I peeled off.\n\nDK: Well, let's get into that \u2014 you were on the Trump payroll for a bit. You at one point advised Scott Pruitt in his bid to become EPA administrator. So in terms of answering the question of \"Why We Did It,\" what can you say about the motivations of D.C. Republican insiders and also of yourself at the time?\n\nTM: Of course there's a money element to this and power, but it's not just that, right? I think \"power\" in particular is a little bit of a misnomer. There are a handful of people that like to wield power in Washington, but power comes with responsibility. Power has downsides.\n\nBeing around power is great to [insiders]. That is, I think, really a driving force for a lot of people. They just want to be in the golf cart with Trump, in Lindsey Graham's case, or they want to be in the back row of a room where they can go home for Thanksgiving and tell their family. This is the drug in D.C.\n\nFor myself, one thing that I talked about was these two elements of inertia and identity. You get into a career, you're mid-level, and then all of a sudden you start to feel kind of icky about it. And then it's like, well, what do I do now?\n\nThe Scott Pruitt situation was that for me. Trump had won. This had been my whole life, being a Republican spokesperson or researcher. And I knew [Pruitt]. I didn't know him that well, but he called me and he's like, \"Hey, will you prep me for this job?\" And I took it just because I was in a crisis \u2014 I was like, \"I don't know what I'm going to do. Am I going to have a job?\"\n\nAnd then I also think that there is the identity element about this, which is \u2014 particularly in Washington, but increasingly, in a concerning fashion, everybody who posts about politics on the internet \u2014 politics becomes part of people's identity.\n\nIn Washington, you have people that \u2014 Republican is who they are. The people that went to their wedding are all Republican operatives. The bar they go to is the Republican bar. Their poker night is Republican poker night. They have a kids' playgroup with other people who are Republican operatives. It's hard then to just say, \"I'm not this anymore.\"\n\nThe thing that surprised me in a bad way was just how much resentment and interpersonal bitterness drove this.\n\nDK: Oh, yeah. The animosity among Republican voters towards Democrats \u2014 and among many Democrats towards Republicans \u2014 is just huge. And you're saying that that negative partisanship is reflected among the Republican ruling class.\n\nTM: For sure. I say this not as a compliment to myself, by the way \u2014 this is a self-criticism \u2014 but I saw this as a little bit of kayfabe, which is this wrestling term of performative anger. Like, Hulk Hogan wasn't really mad at Andre the Giant \u2014 I'm showing my age with that reference. But it was fake.\n\nWhen I was at the RNC as the spokesperson, my job was basically to criticize the Obama campaign. The Obama campaign spokespeople at the time \u2014 Ben LaBolt and Liz Smith \u2014 are friends of mine. Like, we'd go out and drink and trash-talk each other. To me, it was performative, and so that's how I was processing things. I was assuming that everyone was on my level.\n\nAnd what I came to find out is that they really weren't, and that this bitterness towards Obama, [there was] an element of race to it for sure. But more than that, I think that for a lot of the people in the political class, it was this resentment that he got treated so well, that he was the golden child in the media and that everyone loved him and that their candidates didn't get treated as well.\n\nAnd then in the Trump years, this just gets on steroids. What I thought was performative fighting between the parties, among many, many, many of my colleagues actually became a driving, motivating force.\n\nOne guy said to me directly, \"Tim, I'm a white guy, and with all of this woke nonsense and with my wife's friends calling me racist for working for Republicans and all this criticism, all this heat I have to take, I'm not up for jobs. And it just leaves me no choice but to just think about the one or two things I agree with [the Trump administration] on and just focus on that.\"\n\nWhat I came to find out is that that guy really represented the private thoughts of a lot of Republicans.\n\nDK: There's another motivation that I want to drill into. There are two categories of Republicans you call the messiahs and the junior messiahs. And these are people who told themselves and others that they took Trump administration jobs because they were afraid of who would do it otherwise \u2014 that, hey, at least I can be the adult in the room. You do not buy this argument. Why not?\n\nTM: I don't. I think it's the toughest category, because at some level, are we lucky that H.R. McMaster was national security adviser instead of Michael Flynn? Clearly. So it's hard to kind of begrudge H.R. McMaster on the one hand.\n\nOn the other hand, their actions after they took the job \u2014 all of those people who said that they went into the White House because it was better them than someone else \u2014 their actions kind of betrayed that they really had other motivations.\n\nI say that because if it was true that these people went in because they just felt like they had this duty to country and that it was better them in public service than someone else, then they would have supported Joe Biden in 2020. But none of them really came out and said, \"no, we need to stop this person.\" And that would have been the logical next step of somebody that was going in really to save the country.\n\nDK: Throughout your book, it feels like voters are always right at the edge of the picture. I'm thinking about Iowa voters pushing John McCain in 2008 to be tougher on immigration. Or you talk about the formerly moderate New York representative, Elise Stefanik, who justified becoming Trumpier by saying, \"well, I'm just doing what voters want.\" So my question is, you blame a lot of Republican elites for falling in with Trump \u2014 do you feel similarly towards voters?\n\nI don't. I'm of two minds about the voters. One is that I do think they are the ones that are driving this. And my book is about the cowardice of the collaborators. The Republican ruling class would have been happy to go along with a more benevolent person to just continue their access to power, but they went along with the more dangerous and bigoted nativist route, because that's what the voters wanted. And OK, why are voters like that? That's a different book.\n\nI think that the voters have a lot of real reasons why they were upset. I mean, some people are bigots out there for sure. But I think the Republican ruling class didn't listen to [voters'] concerns. I write about the autopsy, which I worked on in 2012. I mean, a lot of Republican voters were mad about the Iraq war, were mad about the hollowing-out of their communities.\n\nWe didn't do anything to try to address that. We didn't challenge Republican orthodoxies on any issues, and Trump did. So I think it makes sense that those voters were attracted to Trump. He was offering them something different.\n\nAnd one of the chapters in the book is [about] the political media class \u2014 the conservative media in particular. It shouldn't be that surprising that if someone is every minute getting a text message or an email or a tweet or a Facebook post about how their country is being stolen from them, that they would want to support radical ends to fix that.\n\nI try to have grace towards voters and people in my life that have gotten swept up in this. And I think that we have, in a representative democracy, an obligation of the people at the top of the funnel to resist people's worst impulses. There was nobody that did that. And that is why those folks are the negative characters in my book.\n\nDK: You mentioned the autopsy you helped write \u2014 the report the RNC released after Mitt Romney lost in 2012, telling the party how to have longer-term success. A lot of it was about working harder to appeal to nonwhite and women voters. Trump certainly did not fit that bill ... and listener Rachel Gershman was wondering in our Facebook group, \"Does the autopsy have any relevance now?\"\n\nTM: Not really. It has relevance as an insight into what the Republican political class, left our own devices, actually wanted. So I think that it's interesting in that regard.\n\nI think there's a lot of reasons to think maybe an autopsy vision of the Republican Party might have worked. Hillary Clinton was a flawed candidate, partially because of that conservative media complex \u2014 the hyperbole and lies that she was targeted with \u2014 but she also had some flaws that she brought upon herself.\n\nCould a candidate that was more moderate on immigration and believed in climate change \u2014 could someone with Elise Stefanik's 2014 platform of believing we should deal with climate change and and supporting gay marriage, could that person have beaten Hillary Clinton? I think maybe, yeah, probably.\n\nBut because Trump won, that created this mindset within the Republican Party, especially after McCain and Romney had lost, that this kind of populist, nativist, working class path is the way for Republicans to win national elections again.\n\nDK: One other thing I wanted to ask about is being a gay Republican. You write about the mental tap dancing you did to support a party that just didn't support gay people like you. I'm wondering if you could tell us how that experience affected how you saw your fellow Republicans do their own sort of tap dancing as they tried to justify their allegiance to Trump.\n\nTM: I spent a lot of time thinking about this because there are obviously limits to any parallel. But I think that there are a lot of parallels.\n\nI look back with regrets on not being more vocal on gay rights matters, on not drawing a bright red line around the types of candidates that I would work for. Part of the reason why I did it when I think back about my own rationalizations was, I felt like the arc of the gay history was bending towards justice, to steal a phrase \u2014 I felt like we were already on this trajectory, and so why should I ruin my career over it?\n\nI also used these same kind of rationalizations of, Oh, the other side's not perfect, too. I mean, in 2008, Obama won't say he's for gay marriage and everybody knows he privately is. You can talk yourself into the fact that, you know, \"the other side is not perfect on this either. And so why should I worry about it?\"\n\nAll of these rationalizations happened, and with the benefit of some distance and with Trump kind of shaking me out of this kind of mindset, I looked back on that and thought, \"Man, I don't think I was seeing myself clearly.\" So when Trump came around, I saw those same machinations happening in my colleagues.\n\nI think the other thing that happened is that whole identity question that I talked about earlier. I was probably the visible gay Republican spokesperson for a while. So I had been through this \u2014 people seeing me in a different way and having to deal with that kind of identity change. And so, I think that it made it less hard for me to do it when Trump came around. I also had those mistakes that I could look back on and say, \"I'm not going to make this mistake again.\"", "label": "human"}
{"text": "As the job market becomes increasingly competitive, employers must be prepared for the growing threat of employee departure. With numerous job opportunities available, employees may be inclined to leave their current role if they're not satisfied.\n\nThis phenomenon is not limited to entry-level positions; even the most in-demand professionals are increasingly prone to job-hopping.\n\nTo shed light on the occupations most susceptible to high employee turnover, we conducted an exhaustive survey of over 1,000 individuals. We asked participants to identify the type of job they anticipate leaving soonest and used the results to compile a ranking of the most likely jobs to experience turnover.\n\nHere are the 20 occupations most likely to experience turnover, listed from least to most likely:\n\n1. Accountant\n2. Chef/Cook\n3. Human Resources\n4. Retail Clerk\n5. Truck Driver\n6. Sales Associate\n7. Administrative Assistant\n8. Marketing Specialist\n9. Web Developer\n10. Lawyer\n11. Teacher\n12. Project Manager\n13. Account Manager\n14. Customer Service Representative\n15. Graphic Designer\n16. Database Administrator\n17. Software Developer\n18. Registered Nurse\n19. Financial Analyst\n20. IT Manager\n\nOur survey revealed that accounting, the most popular job on the list, is the least likely to experience employee turnover. Only 2 percent of the 1,000 respondents indicated plans to leave their accounting job in the near future.\n\nChef/cook and human resources were the second and third least likely positions to experience turnover, with only 3 percent and 4 percent of respondents, respectively, indicating plans to leave.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, IT manager is the job people are most likely to quit soon. Eleven percent of the respondents said they plan to leave their IT manager role.\n\nNotably, the most in-demand job on the list\u2014software developer\u2014also ranked near the top. Ten percent of the respondents said they expect to quit their software developer position soon.\n\nThese numbers don't come as a surprise, considering the rapid pace of technological advancements. As employers demand cutting-edge skills, professionals may be motivated to move to an organization offering a more up-to-date environment.\n\nFinancial analyst and registered nurse were the second and third most likely positions to experience turnover, with 8 percent and 7 percent of respondents, respectively, indicating plans to leave their job.\n\nIt's evident that employees are beginning to feel a greater sense of job security, which could lead to an increase in turnover in the coming months. Employers should proactively engage their workers, provide ample opportunities for growth, and offer competitive compensation packages.\n\nIf employees are happy in their job and have the support of their organization, they are more likely to stay with the same employer for years to come.", "label": "machine"}

Fortunately, there are travel credit cards that can make your airport experience more civilized, including cards that offer statement credits for TSA PreCheck and Global Entry to speed through security and customs lines and credit cards with priority boarding to help get you settled on the plane sooner.\n\nThere's another credit card perk that can offer an escape from the hustle and bustle of the airport terminal. Priority Pass is a network of over 1,300 airport lounges around the world, and you can get a free membership to access them when you have certain credit cards. Some cards also offer up to $30 per person in free food and drinks at select airport restaurants that participate in the Priority Pass program.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the Priority Pass program and how you can get access through select credit cards.\n\nWe're focused here on the rewards and perks that come with each card. These cards won't be worth it if you're paying interest or late fees. When using a credit card, it's important to pay your balance in full each month, make payments on time, and only spend what you can afford to pay.\n\nWhich credit cards offer Priority Pass membership?\n\nMany of these are premium cards with high annual fees that come with other lucrative travel perks \u2014 but there are a few that won't cost you an arm and a leg. And getting Priority Pass access through a credit card is a better deal than purchasing a Priority Pass membership directly \u2014 the program normally charges up to $429 per year for the privilege.\n\nChase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae 4.65 /5 A five pointed star A five pointed star A five pointed star A five pointed star A five pointed star 4.65 out of 5 Stars Intro offer 60,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening Rewards Earn 5x points on flights and 10x total points on hotels and car rentals when you purchase travel through Chase Ultimate Rewards\u00ae immediately after the first $300 is spent on travel purchases annually.

Read our review Read Our Review A looong arrow, pointing right\n\nCompare Priority Pass credit cards\n\nIf you want access to the full range of Priority Pass lounges and restaurants, the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae is a great option. Not only does the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae offer lots of great travel perks, but the Priority Pass Select membership doesn't exclude access to restaurants and cafes like membership through American Express and other cards do.\n\nThe card currently offers a welcome bonus of 60,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening (worth $1,080 in travel, based on Insider's valuation of Chase points). The annual fee is $550, but cardholders receive up to $300 in travel credits each year and top-notch travel and purchase protections.\n\nChase Sapphire Reserve Priority Pass details The primary cardholder and up to two guests get unlimited free visits\n\nAirport restaurants are included (most offer credit for cardholder and one guest)\n\nAuthorized users ($75 each per year) get their own Priority Pass Select membership with guest privileges\n\nFor just $75 annually, you can add an authorized user to your Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae, and this qualifies for the same membership perks. That includes bringing up to two guests into the lounge per visit. Any guests beyond this number can enter at a discounted rate of $32 per person.\n\nThe Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card is Capital One's first-ever premium credit card, and it's a great value if you want a Priority Pass Select membership with unlimited visits and unlimited guests (although if a lounge is busy, you might be limited in the number of guests you can bring).\n\nEffective January 1, 2023, Priority Pass membership from the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card no longer includes access to restaurants, spas, or non-lounge experiences, similar to American Express cards.\n\nIts annual fee of Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card is lower than similar travel rewards cards, and you'll also get access to Plaza Premium Lounges and Capital One's new airport lounges, the first of which recently opened at Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW), with two more opening this year in Denver (DEN) and Washington-Dulles (IAD).\n\nThe Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card is also an affordable choice if you want your authorized users to receive Priority Pass access as well. You can add up to four authorized users for free, and each gets their own Priority Pass Select membership and Plaza Premium/Capital One airport lounge access.\n\nCapital One Venture X Priority Pass details The primary cardholder and an unlimited number of guests get unlimited free visits\n\nAirport restaurants are not included effective January 1, 2023\n\nUp to four free authorized users get their own Priority Pass Select membership with guest privileges\n\nThe Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card offers a welcome bonus of 75,000 bonus miles when you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening (worth $1,275 according to our valuation of Capital One miles). In addition, cardholders receive up to $300 in credit toward Capital One travel portal purchases each year.\n\nThe Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express offers one of the most comprehensive airport lounge programs of any premium credit card, which includes access to the Priority Pass network as well as Centurion lounges, Delta Sky Clubs (when you fly Delta), and several other lounge brands.\n\nPrimary cardholders and authorized users get Priority Pass Select membership** with complimentary admission for up to two guests per visit (additional guests cost $32). You won't get access to Priority Pass airport restaurants because this is an American Express card, so if that's important to you, another different card may be a better fit.\n\nAmex Platinum Priority Pass details The primary cardholder and up to two guests get unlimited free visits\n\nAirport restaurants are not included\n\nYou can add up to three authorized users for $175 total per year and each gets their own Priority Pass membership with guest privileges\n\nThe Platinum Card currently offers a welcome bonus of 80,000 Membership Rewards\u00ae points after spending $6,000 on purchases in the first six months of card membership (worth $1,440 according to Insider's Amex points valuation). It also offers a slew of benefits to help offset its $695 annual fee.\n\nSmall-business owners who travel frequently might prefer The Business Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express , which comes with the same Priority Pass and other lounge access as the personal version of the card. Authorized users cost $300 each and receive their own Priority Pass membership with guest privileges.\n\nAmex Business Platinum Priority Pass details The primary cardholder and up to two guests get unlimited free visits\n\nAirport restaurants are not included\n\nAuthorized users cost $300 per year and receive their own Priority Pass membership with guest privileges\n\nThe Amex Business Platinum Card is offering a welcome bonus of 120,000 Membership Rewards\u00ae points after spending $15,000 on eligible purchases with your card within the first 3 months of card membership (worth $2,160 based on Insider's valuations). You can offset its $695 annual fee with valuable statement credits for airline incidental fees**, Dell Technologies, Indeed, Adobe, and U.S. wireless service providers**, and more.\n\nThe Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant\u00ae American Express\u00ae Card is Marriott's premium credit card, and along with upscale hotel perks and statement credits, it also offers a Priority Pass Select membership for the primary cardholder.\n\nAgain, because it's an Amex card, there's no access to Priority Pass airport restaurants, and in this case, authorized users don't get their own membership.\n\nMarriott Bonvoy Brilliant Priority Pass details The primary cardholder and up to two guests get unlimited free visits\n\nAirport restaurants are not included\n\nAuthorized users do not receive Priority Pass benefits\n\nThe Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant\u00ae American Express\u00ae Card currently offers a hefty welcome bonus: 150,000 Marriott Bonvoy\u00ae bonus points after spending $5,000 in purchases on the card within the first three months from account opening (worth $1,050 in travel, according to Insider's Marriott points valuation).\n\nThere's a $650 annual fee, but in return, cardholders get up to $300 in statement credits per calendar year (up to $25 per month) for eligible purchases at restaurants worldwide, Platinum elite status, and a free night each year after your card renewal month at hotels where the redemption level is at or under 85,000 Marriott Bonvoy points.\n\nThe Hilton Honors American Express Aspire Card is one of the best hotel credit cards because of the generous benefits it offers.

It has a $95 annual fee, but it comes with a Priority Pass Select membership that includes 10 free visits a year.\n\nThis is a good choice for less-frequent travelers who might not need unlimited lounge visits or care about restaurant credits. Keep in mind that authorized users won't receive a Priority Pass membership, either.\n\nAmex Hilton Surpass Priority Pass details The primary cardholder receives a Priority Pass Select membership (no restaurant access)\n\nCardholders receive 10 free visits total (for themselves and guests) each year; after that, visits are $32 each\n\nAuthorized users do not receive Priority Pass benefits\n\nIf you open the Hilton Honors American Express Surpass\u00ae Card now, you can earn an excellent welcome bonus of 130,000 points after spending $2,000 in eligible purchases on the card in the first 3 months of card membership (worth $650 in stays based on our valuations).\n\nCardholders also receive automatic Hilton Gold elite status which offers perks like better rooms and free breakfast (currently awarded as a food and beverage credit in the US).\n\nLike the Hilton Honors American Express Surpass\u00ae Card, The Hilton Honors American Express Business Card is a solid choice if you don't travel often but still want Priority Pass airport lounge access.

You can find out more in our Hilton Honors Business card review.\n\nOther credit cards with Priority Pass lounge access\n\nThere are a couple of other credit cards that come with Priority Pass Select membership, but neither is currently available to new applicants:\n\nCiti Prestige\u00ae Card : Unlimited visits for the primary cardholder and up to two guests or immediate family (defined as spouse/domestic partner and children under 18). Authorized users cost $75 and get their own Priority Pass Select membership with the same guest privileges. The annual fee is $495 for the primary cardmember.\n\n: Unlimited visits for the primary cardholder and up to two guests or immediate family (defined as spouse/domestic partner and children under 18). Authorized users cost $75 and get their own Priority Pass Select membership with the same guest privileges. The annual fee is $495 for the primary cardmember. Ritz-Carlton Rewards\u00ae Credit Card: Unlimited visits for the primary cardholder and no limit on the number of guests. Authorized users are free and receive the same unlimited guest privileges. $450 annual fee.\n\nThe Ritz-Carlton Rewards\u00ae Credit Card is still available as an upgrade from the Marriott Bonvoy Boundless\u00ae Credit Card or Marriott Bonvoy Bold\u00ae Credit Card. If you've had one of these cards for at least a year, it's possible to call Chase and request to change to the Ritz-Carlton Rewards\u00ae Credit Card. You won't earn a welcome bonus, but it could be worth it if the card's benefits are valuable to you.\n\nWhat is Priority Pass?\n\nPriority Pass is a network of more than 1,300 airport lounges, restaurants, and caf\u00e9s worldwide. Many of these are independent lounges that aren't affiliated with a particular airline, but sometimes you'll find branded lounges \u2014 like the Air France/KLM lounge or Star Alliance lounge \u2014 at certain airports.\n\nMany larger US airports have Priority Pass lounges and restaurants, but there are even more overseas, so having a Priority Pass membership is especially useful if you travel internationally.\n\nYou can find Priority Pass lounges and restaurants by searching for your airport on the Priority Pass website or through the Priority Pass app. Here you'll be able to check lounge hours, amenities, guest policies, and any restrictions to be aware of.\n\nPriority Pass lounges\n\nTypically, airport lounges in the Priority Pass network are off-limits to the general public unless you have access through a membership, airline ticket, elite status, or via a paid day pass. They offer a quieter, more comfortable place to relax before a flight, usually offering light food and drinks, free Wi-Fi, and sometimes showers or other amenities depending on the location.\n\nInternational lounges are often nicer with better amenities and food than you'll find in US airports, too. Keep in mind that Priority Pass can deny access to its lounges if they are overcrowded \u2014 if it's busy, you may have to wait to get in.\n\nPriority Pass restaurants, caf\u00e9s, spas, and more\n\nIn addition to airport lounges, the Priority Pass network includes restaurants and caf\u00e9s at airports like Houston (IAH) and San Francisco (SFO). Priority Pass members can get anywhere from $28 to $30 of free food and drinks at participating restaurants.\n\nThe credit is usually enough for an entr\u00e9e or snack and adult beverage \u2014 and this can be a great way to save money if you'd otherwise buy a pricey meal at the airport. Some airports have multiple participating restaurants, and there's no reason you can't use the credit at each one, even on the same trip.\n\nSome airports also have other non-lounge experiences (like spas or rest suites) that are included in the Priority Pass network. In these cases, check the Priority Pass website or app to find out what's included in your complimentary visit.\n\nKeep in mind American Express cardholders no longer get access to Priority Pass airport restaurants or most other non-lounge locations (like Be Relax airport spas). And the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card lost access to Priority Pass restaurants/spas/non-lounge experiences on January 1, 2023.\n\nBe sure to check each restaurant's guest policy \u2014 often the credit is for the primary member and one guest (as opposed to two free guests at most lounges).\n\nPriority Pass membership options\n\nIf you want to buy a Priority Pass membership, there are three options:\n\nStandard membership: $99 per year and enables you to buy lounge passes for $32 per visit\n\nStandard Plus: $299 per year and gets you 10 free visits\n\nPrestige membership: $429 per year and includes unlimited free visits to Priority Pass lounges\n\nAll of these membership tiers allow you to purchase guest passes for $32 per person.\n\nThe Priority Pass membership you get from a credit card is called Priority Pass Select, which you can't purchase directly. It's much better than the publicly available memberships in that most credit cards offer some form of free guest access.\n\nCredit cards with Priority Pass frequently asked questions (FAQ)\n\nIs Priority Pass membership automatic when you open an eligible credit card? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. In most cases, Priority Pass membership does not happen automatically when you're approved for an eligible credit card \u2014 you'll typically have to activate it by enrolling through your card's online account or by calling the number on the back of your card. For example, with American Express cards like the Platinum Card, you'll find an enrollment link under the \"Benefits\" tab in your account online. Each authorized user needs to enroll separately for their own Priority Pass membership as well.\n\nCan you access airport lounges with just your credit card? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. To enter a Priority Pass lounge or receive a food and beverage credit at participating airport restaurants, you'll need to show your Priority Pass Select membership card. Most (not all) lounges will also accept a digital card through the Priority Pass app, but it's best to carry your physical card with you just in case. Your credit card alone will not get you into Priority Pass lounges.\n\nWhat if you have a large family or are traveling in a big group? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. With most cards, you're limited to two free guests \u2014 but if you have more people traveling with you, it may be possible to pay an entrance fee (usually $27 to $32) for your additional companions. Keep in mind there may be restrictions due to space availability so this may not always be an option. One workaround for those with large families is to add a family member as an authorized user to cards like the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae or Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card. That authorized user would get their own membership with two guests allowed \u2014 but keep in mind you must be at least 18 to enroll in Priority Pass.\n\nDo children count as Priority Pass lounge guests? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Most lounges will allow children to enter as long as they're accompanied by a responsible adult, but keep in mind they'll usually be counted as a guest and be subject to an entrance fee if you're over your complimentary guest limit. In some cases, lounges will allow children under a certain age to enter for free (without being counted toward your guest limit), but this is the exception rather than the rule.\n\nIf you cancel your credit card, can you still access Priority Pass lounges? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. When you cancel your credit card, you won't be able to access Priority Pass lounges, even if the expiration date on your membership card is well into the future. The bank notifies Priority Pass about the cancellation and your membership will terminate effective the same day you cancel your credit card.\n\nCan you 'stack' two Priority Pass memberships to get more guests into a lounge? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. If you have more than one Priority Pass membership from different credit cards, it might be tempting to try to use both cards to allow yourself more free guests in a single visit. Unfortunately, you can only use one membership card per visit per person, so it's not possible to stack these benefits. However, it is possible to visit more than one lounge or restaurant in the same airport on the same day.\n\nJasmin Baron, CEPF Editor Jasmin Baron is an editor at Insider, responsible for credit card coverage on Personal Finance Insider.

{"text": "The desire to smell good is nothing new. Based on what archeologists have discovered in ancient tombs, Egyptians and Mesopotamians were making perfume with ingredients such as jasmine, resin and myrrh way back in 3,000 B.C. Today, women\u2019s fragrance is a $679 million industry in the U.S. and Black people account for a whopping $151 million of that spending, according to a 2018 Nielsen Report.\n\nOur demand for perfume is strong, but those who want to go from consumer to creator face a challenging path due to a lack of access to education (traditional perfumers typically study in France), capital and mentorship. Although nearly 74 percent of all perfumers are white, a whiff of change is in the air.\n\nAnd it\u2019s about time. For decades, perfume ads and commercials have served as a reflection of everything most humans want: love, sex, power and validation. Consider the coolness projected by Calvin Klein\u2019s CK One campaigns, the sophistication of Chanel No. 5 images and the sex appeal exuded by Dior J\u2019adore ads. As consumers, we know we\u2019re buying into a fantasy, but the power of perfume is undeniable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith just a spritz or two, fragrance can make you feel confident, desirable and worthy of taking up space. It can unlock memories and create new ones. That\u2019s why a growing group of perfumers from the diaspora is disrupting the landscape with indie brands, letting the industry know that people of color belong there too. These pioneers aren\u2019t just grabbing a piece of the pie \u2014 they\u2019re also forging strong connections with underappreciated customers and championing the need for change.\n\n\u201cDiversity is happening in the niche fragrance business, but it would be great to see more people of color in perfumer roles at the bigger houses,\u201d said Maya Njie, founder of an eponymous line of perfumes. \u201cWith new generations coming in, this will happen more and more. The industry should offer scholarships and training that encourage diversity and show that it is a field where anybody can flourish if they put their mind to it.\u201d\n\nFind out what inspired her and her fellow entrepreneurs:\n\nDawn Marie West, founder and creative director of La Botic\u00e1\n\nDawn Marie West launched La Botic\u00e1 in 2018. Photos courtesy of La Botic\u00e1\n\nQueens, New York-based perfumer Dawn Marie West learned the power of scent at a young age. \u201cMy grandmother was a laundress, and she would wash laundry for clients at home when I was a child,\u201d she said. \u201cThe sheets hanging in our backyard filled the entire house with the smell of fabric softener. The aroma takes me back to my youth and reminds me of my grandmother\u2019s work ethic and the entrepreneurial spirit that she passed down to me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWest is inspired by different times in her life. Photos courtesy of La Botica\n\nBlending fragrances for La Botic\u00e1, the luxury fragrance collection West launched in 2018, also transports her to various times in her life. \u201cI find inspiration in places that represent my culture and what feels familiar,\u201d West said. For example, her scent Nolita 96 was inspired by years working at downtown art galleries (she\u2019s a photographer as well) and captures the vibe of concrete and effortless style. Another standout, Flor de Selva, features indigenous oils found in the Dominican Republic, a nod to West\u2019s Afro-Dominican heritage.\n\nMaya Njie, founder of Maya Njie Perfumes\n\nMaya Njie began to work with fragrances in 2012. Photo credit: Jacob Lillis.\n\nIn 2012, an old photo album inspired London-based perfumer Maya Njie to experiment with fragrance. She began bottling scents tied to her family history and by 2016, she turned what began as a personal project into a lauded line of fragrances. Njie channels her Swedish and Gambian heritage into all aspects of her line, from the minimalist packaging \u2015 which she calls \u201cScandinavian at heart\u201d \u2015 to the fragrance notes.\n\n\u201cTobak is connected to the smell of tobacco leaves, leather, smoke, tonka and wood. Even though it draws an immediate line back to my grandfather in Sweden, the smell is also reminiscent of craft markets in Gambia,\u201d she said. Njie advises aspiring Black perfumers to stay true to themselves while trying to break into the fragrance world. \u201cThere is a place for you here,\u201d she said. \u201cConsumers are keen to support people they can relate to so, keep walking on that path. It\u2019s long and requires persistence but there are plenty of nice people along the way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris Collins, founder of Chris Collins Fragrances\n\n\u201cThe road of a Black perfumer isn\u2019t easy, but the journey is worth it when you see your fragrances touch people,\u201d Chris Collins said. Although he\u2019s been \u201cobsessed\u201d with fragrance since he was a child, he didn\u2019t create his eponymous line until 2018 after spending 20 years as a Ralph Lauren model. \u201cMy father wore classic 1970s colognes like English Leather and Grey Flannel,\u201d Collins said. \u201cI always knew when he was home from work because I could smell him first. That\u2019s when I first fell in love with fragrance.\u201d\n\nChris Collins spent 20 years as a Ralph Lauren model before creating his fragrance line. Photo Courtesy of Chris Collins\n\nHis first trio of perfumes celebrated his historic neighborhood. \u201cI\u2019ve called Harlem home for 18 years,\u201d he said. \u201cI was inspired by the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s, a time when Black culture, music, literature and art flourished. I wanted to tell that story through fragrances.\u201d\n\nFour years later, it\u2019s clear that the industry likes the tales he\u2019s spinning: Collins\u2019 line is now sold at Sephora, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman, Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus.\n\nKimberly Walker, founder of Kimberly Walker New York\n\nKimberly Walker debuted her fragrance Artsy in 2016. Photo Courtesy of KIMBERLY New York\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore launching her namesake line, Kimberly Walker witnessed the lack of diversity in the perfume business up close. \u201cDuring my 10-year career as a department store luxury fragrance sales manager, I never encountered a brand led by a Black, female perfumer,\u201d she said. That motivated her to fill the void. Walker taught herself enough about chemistry and fragrance composition to create Artsy, a sweet and romantic scent that debuted in 2016 (after plenty of trial and error).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still my everyday fragrance and top seller,\u201d Walker said. When blending and naming some of her other fragrances, Jamaican-born Walker drew upon her West Indian heritage. One example: \u201cMy fragrance diaspora is a celebration of people of [African descent] and features Jamaican rose apple paired with notes of sparkling champagne.\u201d\n\nChavalia Dunlap-Mwamba, founder of Pink MahogHany Fragrances\n\nChavalia Dunlap-Mwamba recently launched a new set of gender-neutral scents. Photo Courtesy of Pink Mahogany\n\n\u201cDuring my tenure as an educator, I found out that many people had adverse reactions to fragrance,\u201d said Chavalia Dunlap-Mwamba, the self-taught perfumer behind Pink MahogHany. \u201cMy research confirmed that phthalates [chemicals commonly used to make scents last] were often the culprit. As a fragrance aficionado, I wanted to create a collection without them.\u201d\n\nBased in Longview, Texas, Dunlap-Mwamba has been making scents for 17 years. She said that inspiration comes to her \u201cin every form imaginable,\u201d especially when she\u2019s spending time alone outside. \u201cI always keep a notepad or my phone handy to jot down quick ideas,\u201d she said. This fall, she launched a new set of sweet and earthy gender-neutral scents called The Y\u00d6U Collection, designed to encourage wearers to tap into their sensual side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShawn Crenshaw, founder and CEO of Ovation\n\nShawn Crenshaw introduced the fragrance Ovation for Men in 2017.

While he was shopping for Christmas gifts for his male relatives, he noticed something.\n\n\u201cNot one brand had a face or a representation of anyone that looked like me,\u201d Crenshaw said. \u201cIt hit me like a ton of bricks that we as consumers held these designer brands in such high regard, but none of them \u2015 based on their marketing \u2015 held us equally in such high regard. That\u2019s when I realized there was an opportunity to create a brand that elevated the image of African American men.\u201d\n\nOvation for Men was the result of years of learning about the industry.

{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nAmerican skiing star Mikaela Shiffrin is one win away from equaling Lindsey Vonn\u2019s record of 82 World Cup wins after taking victory in the slalom competition in Zagreb, Croatia, on Wednesday.\n\nThat was Shiffrin\u2019s fifth consecutive win \u2013 and she might not be done yet.

{"text": "As the year 2023 approaches, there is much speculation about the future of the world economy. Prices of goods and services will undoubtedly fluctuate, but there are some products that could become significantly more accessible. With advancements in technology, improved production methods, and increased competition, the cost of certain items could drop substantially, enabling people to conserve resources in the long term.\n\n1. Energy\n\nThe proliferation of renewable energy sources is expected to lead to a significant decrease in the cost of producing electricity. Solar and wind energy are becoming increasingly cost-effective and reliable, with ongoing research aimed at making these sources even more affordable. As the price of renewable energy drops, so too will the cost of electricity from traditional sources like natural gas, coal, and oil.\n\n2. Transportation\n\nThe emergence of self-driving cars is revolutionizing public transportation, making it more affordable for people to travel. Companies like Waymo are developing autonomous vehicles that can safely and efficiently transport individuals. These vehicles have the potential to greatly reduce transportation costs, as they can avoid traffic and operate more efficiently than human-driven cars.\n\n3. Food\n\nAdvances in agricultural technology and genetic engineering are expected to make food production more efficient. Crops could become more resilient to drought, pests, and disease, allowing farmers to produce more food using fewer resources. The production of organic food could also become more accessible, as companies develop better methods for producing it without pesticides and synthetic fertilizers.\n\n4. Communication\n\nThe cost of communication services is likely to decrease in 2023, driven by the development of 5G technology. This will enable people to access faster internet speeds, improved video conferencing, and better connections. Additionally, the advent of cloud computing will allow companies to store data and run applications more efficiently, reducing costs in the process.\n\n5. Education\n\nThe cost of education could become more manageable in the future. Online learning platforms are becoming increasingly popular and efficient, making it easier for people to learn at their own pace and in their own time. Furthermore, educational content is becoming freely available on platforms like YouTube and Khan Academy, allowing anyone to access quality education without breaking the bank.\n\n6. Healthcare\n\nThe cost of healthcare is likely to decrease in 2023, driven by innovative technologies like telemedicine and wearable devices. These technologies could help reduce healthcare costs in the long term by enabling people to access care more quickly and efficiently.\n\nThe future of the world economy is inherently unpredictable, but it appears likely that certain goods and services will become more accessible in the coming year. As technology advances, the cost of energy, transportation, food, communication, education, and healthcare could all become more affordable, enabling people to conserve resources in the long term.", "label": "machine"}

However, since making my investment I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form. Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company. As a result, I am offering to buy 100% of Twitter for $54.20 per share in cash, a 54% premium over the day before I began investing in Twitter and a 38% premium over the day before my investment was publicly announced.

I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form under its current owner. Twitter needs to be transformed as a public company where members will become its owners. Together these members form the governing body of Twitter and under a leadership that can respect Free Speech without spreading disinformation and hatred. Together with my partners, my fund has secured the funding to buy Twitter. As a result, I am offering to buy 100% of Twitter for $18.53 per share in cash (14.26 Billion), as I do not consider the current valuation of $41.09 Billion to be accurate.

Musk has said that his aims for the site include a focus on free speech and a crackdown on bot accounts, which he claimed ran rampant. He took the company private, saying the changes he wanted to make wouldn't be possible in a public company.\n\nBut since Musk took over, Twitter has been sued by some of the thousands of workers he has laid off, faced an exodus of advertisers and celebrities using the site, and has allegedly seen a spike in hate speech. His leadership has been criticized by journalists, experts, Twitter staff, and the public alike.\n\nMusk said in December that he would step down as Twitter's CEO \"as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job.\"\n\nAccording to his Twitter and LinkedIn accounts, as well as his website, Raisini is a music producer and DJ who has been an angel investor at companies including Apple, Tesla, and Virgin Galactic. Raisini's eponymous company says that, among other things, it represents and books celebrities, listing Afrojack, Steve Aoki, Martin Garrix, and David Guetta as examples.\n\nRaisini has been a vocal critic of Musk. In a Twitter thread in November, Raisini called him a \"pathological liar, a charlatan and a Super Villain.\"\n\nRaisini's letter to Musk features the letterhead of Raisini Ltd, a London-based company.

Vertical mergers, which see companies operating at different levels of production in an industry combine, are trickier to build an antitrust case against than horizontal ones that see direct rivals combine \u2014 such as Facebook's (successful) 2012 acquisition of Instagram.\n\nThe Microsoft-Activision deal is seen as a vertical merger, one in which the tech giant would be adding an additional video game developer to its existing roster of in-house developers, rather than creating a developer conglomerate that sees others combine under its watch.\n\nThe most notable, recent success the FTC has had with tackling vertical mergers came in December 2021, when it sued to block the $40 billion acquisition of SoftBank-owned chip designer Arm by industry heavyweight Nvidia.\n\nThe move triggered a series of events that eventually saw the deal collapse in February 2022, with Arm seeking to return to public markets as a plan B.\n\nAt the time, the FTC said \"the termination of what would have been the largest semiconductor chip merger will preserve competition for key technologies and safeguard future innovation.\"\n\nBut the US government has previously struggled to see similar high-profile cases through, with the Department of Justice losing its case to undo AT&T's $80 billion purchase of Time Warner in February 2019, following a ruling from US District Court judge Richard Leon.\n\nMicrosoft has argued that the FTC's probe is \"unconstitutional\" and marks an overreach in its exercising of power.\n\nSkilled negotiator\n\nMicrosoft has also become a skilled negotiator, learning from the bruising it took from antitrust regulators in the 1990s.\n\nIn 1998, the US government accused Microsoft of abusing Windows' popularity to ensure the dominance of Internet Explorer at the expense of rivals such as Netscape.\n\nIt was a blockbuster case that saw Bill Gates appear on Capitol Hill to testify against claims that it violated the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. The court ultimately ruled that Microsoft had been in violation of the act.\n\nThough Microsoft successfully appealed against being broken up, it did agree on settlements that would restrict some of its practices at the time, such as forcing PC makers to work with them exclusively.\n\nSince that saga, Microsoft has worked to avoid the watchful eye of regulators and found ways of negotiating to get what it wants.\n\nTake its $7.5 billion deal to buy game developer Bethesda in September 2020, which had the potential to spark antitrust concerns; the acquisition was finalized six months later after some concessions were made with worried EU regulators.\n\nIt is likely that Microsoft will play a similar game with its Activision purchase. In November, it emerged that Microsoft was considering offering a 10-year licensing deal to PlayStation creator Sony that would make Activision games available to rivals that aren't Xbox, according to Reuters.\n\nThat said, Microsoft's acquisition of Activision will prove even tougher to tackle than anything Amazon has thrown up for the FTC chief to date. Its success will depend on its ability to make a case against one of Silicon Valley's most experienced players, as well as a deal type that has historically stood up to scrutiny.\n\nFailure will likely embolden Big Tech to test the waters further.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "London CNN \u2014\n\nEuropean stocks are pushing higher for the third straight day as investors cheer signs that inflation, supply chain bottlenecks and natural gas prices are all easing\n\nEurope\u2019s Stoxx 600 (SXXL) index rose 1% in Wednesday trading, and is now up 3.3% since markets kicked off 2023 trading on Monday. Germany\u2019s DAX (DAX) rose 1.8% on Wednesday, while France\u2019s CAC (CAC40) gained 1.9%. London\u2019s FTSE 100 index also gained 0.4%.\n\nDespite the undeniably gloomy outlook for the global economy \u2014 the International Monetary Fund expects one third of economies to fall into a recession this year \u2014 investors in European stocks are feeling cautiously optimistic following the release of a string of better-than-expected data indicating that the slowdown might not be as deep as once feared.\n\nOn Wednesday, France\u2019s statistics institute said consumer price inflation was 5.9% in December, down from 6.2% in November. A drop in energy prices drove the decline, the institute said.\n\nIn Germany, Europe\u2019s biggest economy, provisional data released on Tuesday showed that inflation had fallen to 8.6% in December, from 10% the month before. A one-off government payment to households to subsidize energy bills helped bring prices down.\n\nWeaker inflation is raising hopes among investors that the European Central Bank may be able to hike interest rates less aggressively this year, after increasing the cost of borrowing four times in a row since July 2022.\n\nAnd business activity across the 20 countries sharing the euro currency, while historically still low, ticked up in December from the month prior, according to a survey of companies released by S&P Global on Wednesday.\n\nThat adds to promising survey data released on Monday, also from S&P Global, showing that supply chain pressures and inflation for the region\u2019s manufacturers appear to be easing up.\n\nChris Beauchamp, chief market analyst for IG, an online trading platform, told CNN that the boost for markets is partly due to the slowdown in inflation.\n\n\u201cIt seems that investors are being tempted back now that the [Russia-Ukraine] war has been contained, and the worst of the sanctions discussions appear over for the time being,\u201d he added.\n\nTraders aren\u2019t so cheery across the pond. The S&P 500 (DVS) was down 0.4% at the close of trading Tuesday and the Dow (A1BSC) ended little changed, despite rallying in the morning. US futures were up slightly on Wednesday morning, but still trailing markets in Europe.\n\nWall Street\u2019s relatively sluggish start to the new year may be due to the higher number of poor-performing tech stocks in the United States, according to Beauchamp. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (COMP) is down 34% from this time last year.\n\n\u201cIf we are seeing a continued flight to value, then the relative cheapness of European stocks is a big plus,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lack of expensive tech names has been a real boost for the FTSE 100, but other indices in Europe are picking up too.\u201d\n\nAn easing energy crisis\n\nHigh levels of natural gas storage and unseasonably mild weather have put Europe in a stronger position than many feared a few months ago.\n\nBenchmark prices for European natural gas futures have tumbled 10% since Monday to \u20ac69 ($73) per megawatt hour. They\u2019re now down 79% since their all-time high in August, when they traded at \u20ac342 ($363) per megawatt hour.\n\nEuropean countries raced to fill their gas stores last year as Russia, once their biggest supplier, slashed its exports. Stores are currently filled to 84% of capacity \u2014 compared with 52% at the same time last year.\n\nAs such, Europe will likely avoid a much-feared energy shortage this winter, though it still faces the task of refilling its storage before next winter\u2019s heating season with little gas now flowing from Russia.\n\nRecord-breaking temperatures have helped keep storage levels high. On January 1, at least eight European countries recorded their warmest January day ever, climatologist Maximiliano Herrera told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nFears about energy supplies that led to significant outflows from European equities last year now seem \u201cunjustified as the risk of a severe energy shortage has diminished,\u201d Deutsche Bank analysts Maximilian Uleer and Carolin Raab wrote in a note on Wednesday.\n\n\u2014 Christian Edwards contributed reporting.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN \u2014\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un is calling for an \u201cexponential increase\u201d in his country\u2019s nuclear weapons arsenal in response to what he claims are threats from South Korea and the United States, Pyongyang\u2019s state media reported Sunday.\n\nKim\u2019s comments come as North Korea twice over the weekend tested what it claimed was a large, nuclear-capable, multiple-launch rocket system that could put all of South Korea in its range, according to a report from the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).\n\nSpeaking on New Year\u2019s Eve on the final day of a six-day plenary session that reviewed 2022, Kim said South Korea has become an \u201cundoubted enemy\u201d and its main ally, the US, has increased pressure on the North to the \u201cmaximum\u201d level over the past year by frequently deploying its military assets to the Korean Peninsula.\n\nNorth Korea's leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday praised the country's \"super-large\" Multiple Rocket Launcher (MRL), which he claims will put all of South Korea within range and can be loaded with tactical nuclear warheads. KCNA\n\nIn response, Kim said in the coming year that Pyonyang must mass produce tactical nuclear weapons while developing a new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that would give the North a \u201cquick counterstrike capability,\u201d according to the KCNA report.\n\nKim\u2019s comments come at the end of a year that saw his regime test more missiles than at any time in North Korean history, including an ICBM that could in theory strike the US mainland.\n\nOn Saturday, in its 37th day of missile tests in 2022, North Korea fired at least three short-range ballistic missiles from a site south of Pyongyang, according to South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nIt followed that early Sunday with another test. North Korea said both Saturday\u2019s and Sunday\u2019s tests were of a 600mm multiple-launch rocket (MRL) system. Most multiple-rocket launch systems in service around the world are around 300mm in size.\n\nThe 600mm MRL was first introduced three years ago, and production has been increased since late October of 2022 for deployment, Kim said in his speech to the plenary session on Saturday, according to KCNA. He later added that an additional 30 of the 600mm MRL will be deployed to the military simultaneously.\n\nKim said the weapon is capable of overcoming high landforms, can consecutively strike with precision, has all of South Korea in its shooting range and can be loaded with tactical nuclear warheads, according to the KCNA report.\n\n\u201cProspectively, as a key offensive weapon of our military forces, it will carry out its own combat mission to overwhelm the enemy,\u201d Kim said.\n\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, pictured on November 2, 2022, said his country should respond with clear retaliation to North Korea's provocations. Yonhap/Reuters\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry later responded to Kim\u2019s comments, calling them \u201cprovocative language that seriously harms peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula.\u201d\n\nThe ministry urged Pyongyang to \u201cimmediately stop\u201d developing nuclear weapons and return to the path of denuclearization, warning that the \u201cKim Jong Un regime will come to an end if North Korea attempts to use nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\nThe ministry vowed to maintain its military readiness posture to \u201cfirmly respond\u201d to any North Korean threats, adding that the military will strengthen its \u201cthree-axis\u201d defense system designed to counter North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile threats.\n\nThe three-axis defense system consists of the Kill Chain preemptive strike system, the Korea Air and Missile Defense system and the Korea Massive Punishment and Retaliation plan, an operational plan to incapacitate the North Korean leadership in a major conflict.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s President Yoon Suk Yeol said on Sunday during a phone call with military chiefs that North Korea will continue to conduct constant nuclear and missile provocations, and South Korea\u2019s military should respond with clear retaliation, his office said.\n\nExpert: North Korea expanding capabilities\n\nLeif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said Pyongyang has used the past year to demonstrate its ability to perform a range of military strikes.\n\n\u201cIts recent missile launches were not technically impressive. Instead, the high volume of tests at unusual times and from various locations demonstrate that North Korea could launch different types of attack, anytime, and from many directions,\u201d Easley said.\n\nEasley also noted that it\u2019s not just missiles that North Korea is using to up the military pressure on the South. Last week, Pyongyang flew five drones into South Korean airspace, forcing Seoul to scramble fighter jets and helicopters to track them and later to send its own drones into North Korean airspace.\n\nIt all leads to an escalation of tensions, according to Easley.\n\n\u201cSuch provocations, including drone incursions, appear excessive for deterrence and may be intended to scare South Korea into taking a softer policy. But with Kim disavowing diplomacy and threatening to mass produce nuclear weapons, the Yoon administration is likely to further increase South Korea\u2019s defense capabilities and readiness,\u201d Easley said.\n\nFor its part, South Korea is beefing up forces, too.\n\nSeoul\u2019s Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) announced last month it will spend more than $2.7 billion over 10 years to strengthen the mission capabilities and survivability of its fleet of F-15K fighters, jets that would play a key role in any possible strikes on North Korea.\n\nWashington is also not standing still. As well as deploying assets like F-22 fighters and B-1 bombers to the exercises around the Korean Peninsula, the US military recently activated its first Space Force command on foreign soil in South Korea, with the unit\u2019s new commander saying he is ready to face any threat in the region.\n\nThe new unit \u201cwill be tasked with coordinating space operations and services such as missile warning, position navigation and timing and satellite communications within the region,\u201d according to US Forces Korea.\n\nEven before Kim\u2019s latest remarks, experts had noted the big strides Pyongyang had made in its missile forces over the past year.\n\nAnkit Panda, a nuclear policy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told CNN in mid-December that Pyongyang has emerged as a missile power.\n\n\u201cThe bigger picture is that North Korea is literally turning into a prominent operator of large-scale missile forces,\u201d Panda said. \u201cThe word test is no longer appropriate to talk about most North Korean missile launches.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost of the missiles they\u2019ve launched this year are parts of military exercises. They are rehearsing for nuclear war. And that, I think, is the big picture this year,\u201d Panda said.", "label": "human"}

While most children suffered mild impacts, 22.7% of exposed children needed hospitalization, and 8% of them \u2013 573 children \u2013 needed critical care.\n\nMarit Tweet, an emergency medicine doctor at SIU Medicine in Springfield, Illinois, is the lead author on the study. Tweet's curiosity on the topic piqued in 2019, when she started a fellowship at the Illinois Poison Control Center.\n\n\"The big buzz at that time was that cannabis was going to be legalized for recreational, adult use January 1st, 2020\" in Illinois, she said. State marijuana laws have been changing rapidly in the past decade, and the drug is legal for medical use in 37 states and for recreational use in 21 states and Washington, D.C.\n\nTweet was curious how recreational use had gone in other places, so she looked at studies from other states that had already legalized the drug. One study in Colorado documented that the number of children 10 years and under accidentally exposed to marijuana products rose between 2009 and 2015.\n\nSo Tweet wanted to know if this would also happen nationally, as more states legalized the drug. She was most concerned about kids 5-years-old and younger, a particularly vulnerable age for accidental poisoning.\n\n\"This age group accounts for about 40% of all calls to poison centers nationally,\" says Tweet. \"They can get into things, and you can't really rationalize with them\" about dangers.\n\nMarijuana edibles are made to look like sweets, she adds: \"They think it looks like candy, and maybe, they just want to eat it.\"\n\nTweet and her colleagues analyzed information from the National Poison Data System, which draws on calls to the 55 regional poison control centers that serve the United States and its territories.\n\nAndrew Monte, an emergency medicine doctor at University of Colorado hospital, urges parents who suspect their child ate an edible to take the child to a doctor right away.\n\n\"There are some patients that actually have airway obstruction and need to be in the ICU or put on a ventilator,\" says Monte, who was not involved in the study.\n\nMonte says he and his colleagues see these cases in their emergency department several times a month. Colorado was the first state to legalize marijuana for recreational use in 2012.\n\nDr. Nora Volkow, who directs the National Institute on Drug Abuse, says the study's findings are concerning.\n\n\"It's not just the issue that there are more poisonings of children consuming cannabis, but those consumptions appear to be more serious,\" says Volkow.\n\nThe study should also draw attention to how marijuana edibles are packaged and marketed, Volkow says.\n\n\"If you've ever been curious, go to a dispensary or a store where they sell cannabis products, which of course, me being a curious person, I've done,\" Volkow says. \"And the edibles are extremely appealing, in terms of packaging.\"\n\nShe says parents and caregivers who consume edible cannabis products should store them in child-proof containers and keep them out of the reach of children.", "label": "human"}

The company hadn\u2019t previously filed notice to state or local officials of the layoff plans, immediately raising questions about whether the terminations might violate California and federal WARN Acts, although at least some employees reportedly received sufficient pay to negate the need for such notice.\n\nDuring Thursday\u2019s hearing, lawyers for the former employees were set to ask a federal court for an order barring Twitter from seeking separation agreements with laid off employees without informing them of the lawsuit and their associated rights. As part of the requested order, they are also seeking to bar Twitter from communicating with employees in any way that could undermine their rights as part of the litigation.\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs are very concerned that employees will be asked to sign away their rights without notice that they have legal claims to additional benefits and severance and that these legal claims have already been filed on their behalf,\u201d the former employees said in their lawsuit.\n\nLiss-Riordan added during the press conference that, \u201cthe richest man in the world is not above the law. The employees have rights here.\u201d\n\nWeeks after the initial Twitter layoffs, hundreds more Twitter employees exited after Musk gave them an ultimatum to work \u201cextremely hardcore\u201d or leave the company.\n\n\u201cOf all the issues Elon Musk is facing right now, this feels like the easiest one to fix \u2026 treat your workers with respect,\u201d Liss-Riordan said.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "For many years, medical professionals have been providing guidance and care to their patients. However, the emergence of genetic testing and genomics has revolutionized the healthcare landscape. As technology advances, doctors are now able to connect with their patients on a deeper level, exploring the intricate details of their genetic makeup.\n\nRecently, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) launched its Genomic Medicine Initiative, a pioneering effort in the United States. This initiative aims to develop personalized medicine for individuals suffering from a wide range of chronic diseases, including cancer, Alzheimer's, and diabetes.\n\nThrough the application of cutting-edge technologies, the NIH is working to harness the power of genomics to create precise medical care. By analyzing an individual's genetic profile and associated health risks, healthcare providers can design targeted treatments and preventative care regimens tailored to each patient's unique needs.\n\nThis technology not only enables a more comprehensive approach to healthcare but also provides a deeper understanding of an individual's health risks and needs. By grasping a person's genetic makeup and risks, doctors can offer more informed guidance on managing medical care, including recommendations on lifestyle modifications, dietary changes, and medication prescriptions.\n\nThe NIH is also exploring the integration of artificial intelligence into genomic medicine, allowing healthcare providers to better comprehend an individual's health risks and create personalized plans. By collecting data on a patient's health history, lifestyle choices, and genetic information, AI can generate targeted recommendations, reducing guesswork in the medical field and creating a more efficient healthcare experience.\n\nThe Genomic Medicine Initiative marks a significant milestone in healthcare, as it combines the power of genomics and artificial intelligence to create a more personalized approach to patient care. This will enable doctors to better identify risk factors and develop tailored treatments that cater to each individual's unique needs.\n\nFurthermore, this initiative aims to reduce health disparities and ensure that everyone, regardless of financial standing or geographic location, can access the healthcare they need. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies, the NIH seeks to make healthcare more accessible, affordable, and effective for all.\n\nThe Genomic Medicine Initiative is just one of the many projects undertaken by the NIH to improve healthcare access and efficacy. As technology continues to evolve, the healthcare industry is likely to experience even more innovative changes in the future.\n\nIn the years to come, it may be possible for doctors to have a \"presence\" within their patients' DNA \u2013 a truly remarkable development. With the advent of genomic medicine, doctors will possess the tools and resources necessary to better understand and treat their patients. It's an exciting time for healthcare, and with the NIH's guidance, we can look forward to a future with more personalized and effective healthcare for everyone.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Ten years ago, on Dec. 14, 2012, a gunman entered Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, CT, with two rifles and a handgun and killed 20 students between the ages of six and seven and six adults. It is the deadliest mass shooting at an elementary school in American history and the fourth deadliest overall. The attack renewed calls for stricter gun laws and universal background checks. Below, Sarah D\u2019Avino details the life-changing consequences of her sister\u2019s murder, and how she has transformed her pain into recovery.\n\nThat morning, my mom drove me to a doctor's appointment in West Hartford, as she did every week. Later, I was supposed to hang out with one of my girlfriends at my house. When mom and I got back home, my friend was already there. She looked shaken and told us, \u201cI have to go! I can't hang out today. I just got word there was a shooting at my nephew's school.\u201d That school was Sandy Hook Elementary.\n\nMy mom and I were in so much pain for her, seeing her look so distraught. We told her, \u201cGo! Go! Go!\u201d We go inside the house and turn on the news. We begin to hear aerial sounds above the house. Minutes later, Rachel's boyfriend, Anthony Cerritelli, rushed into the living room\u2014we all lived together\u2014and he goes, \u201cThat\u2019s Rachel's school.\u201d We thought Rachel was at Newtown Elementary School the entire time, but it was that very second we learned she had switched to Sandy Hook less than a week earlier.\n\nRachel had her master\u2019s from Post University in behavioral therapy, was working on her doctorate in the same field from the University of St. Joseph, and was about to become a board-certified behavioral analyst. She was doing her clinical hours with one of the Sandy Hook students on the autism spectrum, seven-year-old Josephine Gay, who also died that day. Rachel's job was to make the \u201cmainstream\u201d classroom inclusive for Josephine, accommodate her needs, and help her integrate with the other students.\n\nRachel, left, with Hannah, center, and Sarah. Courtesy Sarah D'Avino\n\nAfter Tony tells us she\u2019s at Sandy Hook, we panic when we don\u2019t hear from Rachel. We looked at our phones repeatedly, hoping and waiting to hear from her. When we got no response, my mom drove us to the Town Hall. We weren\u2019t there long before the police caravanned us across town to the firehouse, which became the official family meeting area. Then, one by one, we witnessed families being told their child wasn't coming home. It was painful, especially not knowing what was happening with Rachel.\n\nThe shooting was at nine in the morning. By nine that night, we still had no word. At this point, it's just my mom and me sitting at the fire station. Because Rachel was so new, her name wasn't on any list. But the officers knew they had a family looking for a \u201cRachel D'Avino,\u201d and they knew they had a body whose name they didn\u2019t know, but they didn't want to tell us anything until they were sure. Finally, an officer walks over to us. It must\u2019ve been killing this man to watch us wonder all day. When he got to where we were, I assume he broke every protocol when he said, \u201cAnybody who was in that school, and we don't know who they are, is gone.\u201d I collapsed on my mother. We screamed on top of each other. A priest came over, put his hands on us, and said a prayer. I grabbed his hand.\n\nWe left shortly after that and drove home to tell my younger sister, Hannah. I remember just taking deep breaths, clenching that steering wheel with all my might, and thinking, Just suck it up and get mom home. Then, around 2:30 in the morning\u2014now it's a Saturday\u2014we get a knock on the door. There are police officers, social workers, and that same priest at our door. They hand us a packet on how to go about making funeral arrangements. That was our confirmation: Rachel had been identified by her tattoos.\n\nOne by one, we witnessed families being told their child wasn't coming home.\n\nThat night, I had been clean four years: From 16 to 21, I abused substances, mostly opioids. After hearing the news, I didn\u2019t know how to feel what I was feeling. So, I returned to what I knew \u2014 I relapsed and had a drink. What started as using to numb the pain after a few years became using against my will. In the 10 years since Rachel died, the first half was spent using to not feel, then there was about a year of using because I didn't know how to stop. I was stuck in a cycle of active addiction, where I would watch myself, wish I wasn't doing it, but not know how to stop. And finally, one day, I just put my hands up and said, God, either kill me or fix me because I can't do this anymore. I found a 12-step program and committed to it. I worked very hard on recognizing patterns in my life and why I choose substances when I'm in pain. On Feb. 26, I will have four years completely clean and sober. I am in grief and trauma counseling and finally unclenching that steering wheel. If I had a magic wand, I would not change that process. I needed every single one of those stepping stones to be who I am today. I have a sponsor who tells me, \u201cYou can't climb a smooth mountain.\u201d\n\nOne week after the shooting, on Dec. 21, we held Rachel\u2019s funeral at The Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, CT. I gave her eulogy. That was the most important thing I could do for her. I spoke about how\u2014Rachel being the oldest of us three sisters\u2014our foundation was rocked. The church was standing room only with a video camera doing live feed to the church hall because that was filled with people, too. The sign-in book from that day has 695 signatures, many of which just say the so-and-so family\u2014so it was probably close to 1,000 who came to honor Rachel. It was beautiful to see how much she was loved and remembered.\n\nFor the first year after the shooting, I felt paraded around. There were memorials, trips to D.C., interviews, family and friends showing up at the house, and standing in front of cameras and reporters. I felt very exposed. Today, I'll go through something painful, like a breakup, and my friends would say, \u201cWow, you talk so freely about your pain.\u201d And I'll tell them, \u201cWell, you have to imagine what it's like for your grief process to be on the 11 o'clock news.\u201d\n\nRachel and her mom. Courtesy Sarah D'Avino\n\nI believe the day Sarah left us, she became my guardian angel. I\u2019ve survived overdoses where there was no medical explanation as to why. I was told since I was a teenager I\u2019d never carry a pregnancy to term. Now, I\u2019m a mom.\n\nI\u2019ve often thought about my relationship with Rachel and how my addiction and mental health issues drove a wedge between us. I wasn\u2019t an easy sister to be around, and we didn\u2019t get along, and I deeply regret that. There are no pictures of us past middle school. I regret that I can't go back and fix our relationship. But what\u2019s in my control now is how I apply the lessons from her loss to those still in my life: I document memories of myself and my loved ones; I will tell you I love you more; I will forgive faster; I will agree to disagree quicker. Because I can't undo any of that with Rachel.\n\nGrowing up, Rachel was the ringleader. In kindergarten, her teacher called her one-gate Rachel because it didn't matter if there was a fire drill or an ice cream truck outside, Rachel was only going at the pace Rachel wanted to go at. She remained that way into adulthood. She was bright and focused, an independent thinker who was always driven and always had a heart to help others, even before herself. I grieve for the loss of who Rachel would have become. I grieve for the children she would have had and the doting aunt she would have been. Rachel would\u2019ve raised the world's most well-rounded and highly self-esteem-possessing children. She would\u2019ve had an opportunity to see who I've become. She would love this Sarah and want to spend time with me and tell me she loves me. It doesn't just end with losing 29-year-old Rachel; it is a lifelong loss.\n\nI know with all of my heart that Rachel is always protecting me, guiding me, and sending love and light my way.\n\nWhen my grandfather passed away, my grandmother gave me her engagement ring. It caused a bit of a stir between us because, as the oldest, Rachel felt it would be hers. A few months before she died, I don't know why, but I put the ring by the coffee pot early one morning with a note that said Rachel, this always should have been yours. Love, Sarah. The ring had been missing a stone or two. Tony, her boyfriend, had the ring cleaned and replaced the stones. A few weeks before the shooting, he asked my mom and my stepfather for permission to propose to Rachel on Christmas Eve. She didn\u2019t know. She would\u2019ve said yes.\n\nI once heard a quote that a person dies twice: Once when they take their last breath and the second time when their name is spoken for the last time. If that's the case, Rachel is going to live forever. There are monuments in her honor, and she's still a part of our family. Gregory, my 18-month-old son, knows he has an Auntie Rachel. She's talked about just as much as any other family member. He\u2019s been to her gravesite. We\u2019ve told him stories about how she could sometimes be mischievous. How we\u2019d put on a little play for our mom after dinner. Gregory may never meet his auntie, but he will always know her.\n\nThroughout my grieving process, I\u2019ve thought about my mother the most. Because, as a new mom, I\u2019d look at my son and just get lost in my love for him. I would go hungry for him. I would go sleepless for him. But I only have the one. I could only imagine what it\u2019s been like for my mom. When you have more than one child, there isn't love more for any specific one of them, but there is that one that made you a mother. With Rachel\u2019s death, my mom lost the child that made her a mother. I can\u2019t even grasp what that would feel like, so that\u2019s stayed with me.\n\nRachel and her dog Diezel, who accompanied her when working with special needs clients. Courtesy Sarah D'Avino\n\nIn this 10-year grieving process, I\u2019ve learned that it's okay to hurt. It's okay to feel pain. It's okay to think nobody understands or that it'll never go away. I\u2019ve learned to not run away from grief and pain. That recovery is possible, that there's no rock bottom with addiction, there\u2019s just death. That hope is out there and doesn't end until life does. I\u2019m no longer afraid to admit that when Rachel died, yes, I turned to substances\u2014it was the only thing I knew then to quench my pain. When life happens again, and it will, I know that I\u2019m not exempt from grief and trauma and pain. None of us are. It is one of those hard-to-swallow pills of life. But now, I have a program of recovery, a toolbox of healthy coping skills, and a network of angels on earth to catch me. I know with all of my heart that Rachel is always protecting me, guiding me, and sending love and light my way.\n\nI\u2019ve also learned that trying to dull my pain with any substances only causes more, new, and different pain. I learned that the answer is not in a bag. The answer is not in a bottle. I did not find Rachel in any pill. I did not find her inside any needle. All that did was take me farther away from her memory. And now, being clean, being in recovery, living every day, one day at a time, for myself, I know that I am Sarah. I am not the things that have happened to my family and me. I am not the pain I've gone through. I don't have to spend the rest of my life being Sarah, Rachel's little sister who lost her to a tragic incident. I'm Sarah first, and it took 10 years to find this Sarah.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and length.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Environmental protection and sustainability are becoming increasingly important and are increasingly becoming a central theme in public debate. A new group of activists, who call themselves \"Climate Stickers\", have emerged as a driving force behind this movement over the past few years. Their direct and provocative actions have sharpened public awareness of climate change and sharpened the focus of policymakers. But how are the Climate Stickers actually paid, and what do they spend their work on?\n\nTo answer this, we interviewed some of the most renowned Climate Stickers across the country and were surprised by how much they earn and spend.\n\nThe activists who identify as Climate Stickers see themselves as those who advocate for immediate and ambitious global climate policy. They believe in direct actions to raise public awareness and are willing to take risks to draw attention to climate change and climate protection.\n\nAccording to our interviews, Climate Stickers typically earn between 500 and 1000 euros per action. Some earn more, while others earn less. The companies that hire them usually pay them either per action or a flat rate, depending on their work.\n\nDespite the money they receive, the Climate Stickers remain very committed and dedicated to fighting for climate protection. They are aware that what they do goes beyond just money. It's a completely altruistic movement focused on creating comprehensive climate protection.\n\nEven though Climate Stickers don't earn much money, they spend their earnings very carefully. Some use their income for local environmental projects or additional equipment like stickers, banners, and signs. Others invest it in travel to speak at events and conferences or to develop new campaigns.\n\nFurthermore, many Climate Stickers support smaller companies that produce goods sustainably and participate in fundraising campaigns for environmental and sustainability organizations.

The latest release comes as the panel winds down its work with the House majority set to change hands from Democrats to Republicans next week at the start of the new Congress.\n\nSo far, the released transcripts have provided illuminating insights into the final weeks of former President Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, with accounts from inside the Trump White House, from federal and state officials who resisted pressure to overturn the 2020 election results, and many others.\n\nHere are some of the highlights from Thursday\u2019s disclosures:\n\nDonald Trump Jr. explains why he texted Meadows on November 5 about plans to keep his father in office\n\nDonald Trump Jr. told the committee that the reason he texted Meadows a detailed plan about how to ensure his father would get a second term two days after the 2020 presidential election was because he thought the ideas were \u201cthe most sophisticated\u201d and \u201csounded plausible.\u201d\n\nTrump Jr.\u2019s testimony, revealed by the select committee on Thursday, provides new context to a text message CNN first reported on in April where he lays out various ideas for keeping Trump in power by subverting the Electoral College process.\n\nThe November 5 text message outlines a strategy that is nearly identical to what allies of the former President attempted to carry out in the months that followed. Trump Jr. makes specific reference to filing lawsuits and advocating recounts to prevent certain swing states from certifying their results, as well as having a handful of Republican state houses put forward slates of fake \u201cTrump electors.\u201d\n\nIf all that failed, according to the Trump Jr. text, GOP lawmakers in Congress could simply vote to reinstall Trump as President on January 6, 2021.\n\n\u201cWe have operational control Total leverage,\u201d the message reads. \u201cMoral High Ground POTUS must start 2nd term now.\u201d\n\nAlthough Trump Jr. said that he was not the original author of the text, a point his lawyer made to CNN back in April, and that he did not remember who the original author of the message was, he explained to investigators why out of all the messages he was being sent at the time, he felt this one was necessary to pass on to Meadows.\n\n\u201cPerhaps in reading it, it was the most sophisticated, you know, and detailed, and again, about things I don\u2019t necessarily, you know, know too much about, but it sounded plausible and I wanted to make sure that we were looking into the issues brought up in the text,\u201d Trump Jr. said.\n\nMeadows did not initially respond to the original November 5 text, but when Trump Jr. followed up the next day to make sure he saw, Trump\u2019s then-chief of staff texted, \u201cmuch of this had merit. Working on this for PA, so Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina already.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump Jr., fianc\u00e9e don\u2019t recall details and distance themselves from events that led to January 6, transcripts show\n\nDonald Trump Jr. told the committee he couldn\u2019t recall key details related to his appearance at a rally that preceded the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nTrump Jr. said he didn\u2019t know Turning Point Action paid him and his fianc\u00e9e Kimberly Guilfoyle $30,000 each for their appearances at the rally on the White House ellipse. He said he thought the money was for an event at the Palm Beach Hilton in December, according to a transcript released Thursday.\n\n\u201cMy recollection was that we had spoken for them prior to Christmas at an event that we did annually and always got sort of paid for speaking fees to show up,\u201d Trump Jr. said.\n\nIn transcripts of their interviews with the House select committee, Trump Jr. and Guilfoyle repeatedly said they didn\u2019t recall details and distanced themselves from the events that led to the January 6 attack. Trump Jr. told committee investigators, \u201cI don\u2019t recall specifically,\u201d when asked if he ever received the $30,000 and \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d when asked if Guilfoyle ever ended up getting paid.\n\nThroughout their testimony, Trump Jr. and Guilfoyle said they didn\u2019t remember specific conversations about rally planning and that they were in the dark about the particulars as it was being put together.\n\nGuilfoyle also denied having conversations with anyone linking the rally to objections to Congress certifying Joe Biden\u2019s electoral win.\n\n\u201cI was not involved in any of that certification stuff. I couldn\u2019t explain it to you to this day,\u201d she said, adding that she didn\u2019t know the significance of holding the rally on January 6.\n\n\u2018Just give me five dead voters\u2019: Sen. Lindsey Graham said after 2020 election, Trump lawyer tells committee\n\nAfter the 2020 election, Sen. Lindsey Graham pledged to become a \u201cchampion\u201d of then-President Trump\u2019s election fraud claims \u2013 if only Trump\u2019s advisers would give him information about dead voters, according to an account given to the January 6 committee.\n\n\u201cSenator Graham was saying, \u2018Get me your information,\u2019\u201d Trump lawyer Christina Bobb relayed to the committee about what Graham said in a meeting days before the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\n\u201cJust give me five dead voters,\u201d Bobb said Graham told then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and others in Meadows\u2019 office at the White House.\n\n\u201cGive me, you know, an example of illegals voting. Just give me a very small snapshot that I can take and champion,\u201d Bobb added, relaying what Graham said at the time.\n\nThe exchange with Graham highlights how the South Carolina Republican became involved in Trump\u2019s pressure campaign to overturn his election loss in Georgia, and how the White House at the time was connecting with influential politicians to advance Trump\u2019s message of false election fraud claims.\n\n\u201cGraham was like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019d love to support the cause. I think it would be great to, you know, really show all the fraud. Send me a memo and show me, you know, what information you have got. I\u2019ll champion it,\u2019\u201d Bobb also recalled from the conversation with Graham.\n\nAccording to a transcript of Bobb\u2019s House testimony released Thursday, Graham received a memo from the legal team working with Trump, titled \u201cChairman Graham dead votes memo for your consideration.\u201d\n\nBut Bobb added: \u201cHe did nothing with it.\u201d\n\nGraham\u2019s office pointed out on Thursday that the book \u201cPeril\u201d by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa previously described a similar exchange between Graham and the Trump advisers. After receiving their memo, the senator was unconvinced of the fraud they claimed, the book said. His office didn\u2019t provide any further response.\n\nGrisham says she learned Trump thought rioters \u2018looked very trashy\u2019 but loved that they were \u2018fighting for him\u2019\n\nStephanie Grisham, a former White House press secretary and chief of staff to Melania Trump, said she learned from people inside the West Wing on January 6, 2021, that Trump thought the rioters \u201clooked very trashy,\u201d but reveled in how they were \u201cfighting for him.\u201d\n\nGrisham told the committee: \u201cI heard from several people in the West Wing, more on the military aide or Secret Service side, and then a couple just people, but that he was sitting in the dining room, and he was just watching it all unfold, and that a couple of his comments \u2013 some of his comments were that these people looked very trashy, but also look at what fighters they were.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was kind of reveling in the fact that these people were fighting for him. But he also didn\u2019t like how they looked,\u201d Grisham said.\n\nMelania Trump didn\u2019t trust her husband\u2019s inner circle, the former first lady\u2019s chief of staff says\n\nGrisham also detailed the former first lady\u2019s distrust in people close to her husband after the 2020 election, including Donald Trump Jr.\n\n\u201cCertainly when it came to the kids, especially Don Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle, she never trusted that they were doing things in the best interest of their \u2013 of Don Jr.\u2019s father,\u201d Grisham told the committee.\n\nGrisham said Melania also distrusted \u201cpeople that she thought were giving her husband bad advice,\u201d like lawyers Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani and campaign staffers. \u201cShe would say, I think they\u2019re giving him bad advice, I don\u2019t think this is smart.\u201d\n\nFormer Trump acting defense secretary endorsed giving DC mayor more control of DC National Guard\n\nChris Miller, who served as acting defense secretary at the end of the Trump administration, told the committee he thought the Washington, DC, mayor should have greater control of the DC National Guard in the wake of the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\nMiller was asked in his January deposition about a proposal in Congress to give the Washington, DC, mayor the same authority to deploy the National Guard that a governor has. Because the District of Columbia is not a state, the authority to deploy is delegated to the Army secretary by the defense secretary and president.\n\nMiller said of the DC mayor being given more authority over the Guard: \u201cBeing a private citizen, I\u2019ll tell you exactly what I think, and take it or leave. Heck, yeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe mayor should absolutely have greater control over the DC National Guard,\u201d he continued, according to a transcript released by the panel Thursday. \u201cI do not know the history. And I\u2019m sure there\u2019s all sorts of reasons that are constitutional, way beyond what I understand, so I\u2019m just kind of popping off, but there\u2019s got to be a way to integrate her or the mayor into this process of work meaningfully and more proactively.\u201d\n\nMiller testified to the committee about the lag in getting National Guard soldiers to the Capitol on January 6, saying that he didn\u2019t know why Major Gen. William Walker, the DC National Guard Commander, believed he didn\u2019t have approval to deploy. According to the January 6 committee\u2019s report, Walker \u201cunderstood he had to wait for approval from Secretary (Ryan) McCarthy to deploy his forces. But as he waited on that video call for hours, he did strongly consider sending them anyway.\u201d", "label": "human"}

{"text": "A meeting between Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Joe Biden took place on Monday, focusing on the need to address Russia's ongoing aggressive actions in the region.\n\nThe two leaders, speaking to the press in Kyiv, emphasized the importance of Russia ceasing its incursions into Ukrainian territory and warned that the situation is approaching a critical juncture.\n\nZelensky and Biden also discussed strategies to enhance the resilience of Ukraine and other countries in the region to counter Russia's aggression.\n\n\"The United States will not remain idle while Russia continues to threaten the security of Ukraine and its neighbors,\" said Biden. \"We stand prepared to assist Ukraine in strengthening its capacity to defend itself and deter Russian aggression.\"\n\nBiden went on to state that the US would aid Ukraine in bolstering its defense capabilities and ensure that Ukraine had access to the necessary resources to build its defense forces.\n\nBiden also called on Russia to halt its \"malevolent activities\" in Ukraine, noting that the US is prepared to collaborate with its allies in the region to \"maintain sovereignty and territorial integrity.\"\n\nThe two leaders also addressed the need for increased economic support for Ukraine and a more effective fight against corruption.\n\n\"We are committed to working with the Ukrainian government to combat corruption and economic mismanagement to ensure the economic future of this nation,\" said Biden.\n\nZelensky noted that the US was providing \"not only moral but also material support\" to Ukraine.\n\n\"This support helps Ukraine to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity, to counter Moscow's aggression, and to build a secure future,\" he said.\n\nThe meeting between the two leaders comes as tensions remain high in the region, with Russian-backed forces continuing their offensive in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe conflict in the region has been ongoing since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and began supporting the separatist movement in Ukraine's east.\n\nThe meeting between Zelensky and Biden takes place ahead of the US president's first official visit to Kyiv, which is expected to occur later this month.\n\nDuring his visit, Biden is expected to meet with Ukraine's leaders and discuss ways to advance the implementation of the Minsk Agreement, which aims to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe visit also comes as Biden and his team attempt to rebuild ties with Russia that deteriorated significantly under the administration of former President Donald Trump.\n\nSpeaking at Monday's joint press conference, Biden reaffirmed the US' commitment to Ukraine and vowed to continue to stand with the country in the face of Russian aggression.\n\n\"It is imperative that we stand together against Russian aggression and support Ukraine as it works to build a better future,\" said Biden. \"The United States is and will remain a steadfast partner of Ukraine.\"\n\nZelensky thanked Biden for his \"unprecedentedly strong support\" and stated that the US is \"essential in helping Ukraine become a strong and prosperous country\".\n\nThe Ukrainian leader also noted that the US has been supporting Ukraine since its independence in 1991 and that the country is now \"on the brink of a crucial turning point in its history\".\n\nThe two leaders also discussed strategies to strengthen their countries' partnership and to push for greater international cooperation to address the security challenges in the region.\n\n\"It is important for us to continue to make progress on our shared interests in security, economic development, and democracy,\" said Biden.\n\nIn conclusion, Biden and Zelensky agreed to continue their cooperation to help build a strong and secure Ukraine and to work together to address the security threats posed by Russia in the region.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Researchers at the University of Vermont analyzed 1,000 TikTok videos under the most popular hashtags related to body image and eating Jakub Porzycki | NurPhoto | Getty Images\n\nTikTok ban on government devices\n\nThe banning of TikTok on government devices could benefit rival platforms like Snap and Meta's Facebook and Instagram that also fight for young consumers' attention. The bill includes an exception for law enforcement, national security and research purposes. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, as well as FBI Director Christopher Wray, have voiced fear that TikTok's ownership structure could make U.S. user data vulnerable, since companies based in China are required by law to hand over data if the government requests it. TikTok has repeatedly said its U.S. user data is not based in China, though those assurances have done little to alleviate concern. The company has been working toward a deal with the administration to assuage national security fears through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. \"We're disappointed that Congress has moved to ban TikTok on government devices \u2014 a political gesture that will do nothing to advance national security interests \u2014 rather than encouraging the Administration to conclude its national security review,\" a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement following the release of the package text. \"The agreement under review by CFIUS will meaningfully address any security concerns that have been raised at both the federal and state level. These plans have been developed under the oversight of our country's top national security agencies \u2014 plans that we are well underway in implementing \u2014 to further secure our platform in the United States, and we will continue to brief lawmakers on them.\"\n\nDeterring online counterfeit sales\n\nThe spending package also includes the INFORM Consumers Act, which seeks to deter counterfeit, stolen or harmful products from being sold online. The bill requires online marketplaces like Amazon to promptly collect information like bank and contact details from \"any high-volume third party seller\" and to verify that data. Though Amazon initially opposed the bill last year, writing that it was \"pushed by some big-box retailers\" and claiming it would punish small businesses that sell online, the company ended up supporting a version of the bill, saying it was important to have a federal standard rather than a patchwork of state laws. Etsy and eBay had earlier supported the bill. \"Passing the bipartisan INFORM Act would be a major victory for consumers, who deserve to know who they're buying from when they visit an online marketplace,\" Kovacevich said in a statement. \"This legislation has been through years of hearings and markups and has earned the support of both parties as well as brick-and-mortar stores and online marketplaces.\" Etsy's head of Americas advocacy and public policy, Jeffrey Zubricki, said in a statement the bill \"will achieve our shared goal of protecting consumers from bad actors while avoiding overly broad disclosure requirements that would harm our sellers' privacy and hinder their ability to run their creative businesses.\"\n\nHigher fees for big mergers\n\nWhile more ambitious antitrust measures targeting digital platforms didn't make it into the end-of-year legislation, there is one bill to help raise money for the antitrust agencies that scrutinize mergers. The Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act will raise the cost companies pursuing large mergers must pay to file with the antitrust agencies, as they're required to do under the law. The bill also lowers the cost for smaller deals and allows the fees to be adjusted each year based on the consumer price index. The measure is meant to help fund the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice Antitrust Division, which have seen a large uptick in merger filings over the past few years without adequate budget increases. While it fell short of antitrust advocates' hopes, the inclusion of the merger filing fee bill still gained praise. \"This is a major milestone for the anti-monopoly movement,\" said Sarah Miller, executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project, backed in part by the Omidyar Network. Miller said the bill will \"significantly strengthen antitrust law for the first time since 1976.\" \"Big Tech, Big Ag and Big Pharma spent extraordinary sums in an unprecedented effort to keep Congress from delivering on antitrust reform and undermine the ability of state and federal enforcers to uphold the law \u2014 and they lost,\" Miller added. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who sponsored the bill, said in a statement earlier this week its inclusion \"is an important step to restructure merger fees after decades of the status quo so we can provide our antitrust enforcers with the resources they need to do their jobs.\" \"This is clearly the beginning of this fight and not the end,\" she said. \"I will continue to work across the aisle to protect consumers and strengthen competition.\"\n\nEmpowering state AGs in antitrust cases\n\nAnother antitrust bill included in the package was a version of the State Antitrust Enforcement Venue Act. The bill gives state attorneys general the same power as federal enforcers in antitrust cases to choose the district in which they bring their cases and prevent them from being consolidated in a different district. Under the legislation, companies defending against claims of antitrust violations won't be able to pick what they perceive to be a more favorable venue to fight the case. That's what happened in an antitrust case against Google brought by a group of state attorneys general accusing the company of illegally monopolizing the digital advertising market. The company transferred the case from Texas to New York, to be heard alongside private antitrust complaints against the company in the pretrial proceedings. Last year, attorneys general from 52 states and territories wrote Congress in support of the legislation.\n\nTransparency on ransomware attacks\n\nThe bipartisan RANSOMWARE Act also made it into the spending bill, requiring the FTC to report to Congress on the number and types of foreign ransomware or other cyberattack complaints it receives. The FTC also must report to Congress trends in numbers it sees in these complaints, including those that come from individuals, companies or governments of foreign adversaries like China, North Korea, Iran and Russia. And it must share information on its litigation actions related to these cases and their results. The FTC can also share recommendations for new laws to strengthen resilience against these attacks as well as for best practices that businesses can follow to protect themselves.\n\nResearch into tech impacts on kids\n\nA version of the Children and Media Research Advancement (CAMRA) Act is included in the package, directing the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct or support research on the effects of media and technology on infants, kids and adolescents. Those effects could include the impact on cognitive, mental and physical health by technologies like social media, artificial intelligence, video games or virtual reality, according to the legislation. The director of the National Institutes of Health must deliver a report to Congress on its work within two years of the law's enactment. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.

{"text": "2022 was a bumpy year in the markets, even for portfolio mangers who purposefully went out of their way to avoid turmoil. But the Janus Henderson Investors' Balanced Fund has been able to shield itself from at least part of the year's volatility by reducing exposure to equities and leaning more on fixed income. \"The intention has always been to provide our investors with a smoother ride over time, with less volatility to returns by combining growth equities with fixed income,\" said Jeremiah Buckley, a portfolio manager. In a year of broad market losses, that strategy has allowed the fund to outperform, at least on a relative basis. The retail share class (JABAX) lost 16.4% in 2022. That gives it a slight edge over the S & P 500 , which dropped nearly 20% last year . Morningstar rates the 30-year-old fund five stars among peers with 50% to 70% of allocations in equities. It has an annual expense ratio of 0.82%. 'Harder to find a safe place' In recent years, the fund's focus on growth stocks has helped drive gains. The fund gained 22%, 14% and 17% annually in 2019 through 2021, respectively, as technology stocks outperformed. (JABAX ranks in the 8th percentile among its peer funds over the past five years, and the 4th percentile over the past 15, Morningstar says.) Winds shifted in 2022, however, as investors traded growth for value names as interest rates rose and concerns mounted over a looming recession. Buckley said he recognized early in the year that the inflationary environment could trigger Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, creating a harsh environment for both stocks and fixed income. But he felt more confident in how bond holdings would respond. In turn, he cut the percentage of the fund's stock exposure to 55%, as of Nov. 30, from around 64%. Fixed income accounted for about 44%. \"This year has been tricky, obviously, because there's been such a high correlation between fixed income and equity returns,\" he said. \"It's been harder to find a safe place, essentially, during this year.\" The fund's recent history shows a trend of underperforming during strong up years for the S & P 500, while being able to outperform in downdrafts. In 2018, for example, the last time the S & P 500 saw a down year, the Janus Henderson fund, which today runs assets of some $23.7 billion, eked out a 0.5% return. Buckley said it's normal to adjust the fund's allocation in times of turmoil. Equity allocations came down in 1999 ahead of the 2000-2002 bear market. Stock exposure came down again again in 2006 before the 2008 financial crisis, then rose back in 2009 to coincide with recovery. In early 2020, Janus Henderson lowered the fund's equity allocation, but quickly added exposure again as the market improved. Microsoft , which Buckley characterizes as a \"core growth\" stock, made up the largest share of the fund as of Nov. 30, at 4.4%. The top 10 holdings comprised nearly 23% of fund assets . Within fixed income, Buckley said the fund has been more conservative by reducing exposure to corporate credit. The fund has moved from a focus on short duration to becoming more neutral amid growing hope the Federal Reserve will continue slowing its hikes in interest rates. The central bank raised borrowing costs half a percentage point in December after four straight increases of three quarters of a point earlier in the year. Long-term outperformer Most recently, Janus Henderson Balanced underperformed 77% of its peer group in 2022, pushed down by the recent rally in value stocks, according to Morningstar analyst Karen Zaya. But Zaya said the returns are attractive for long-term investors over longer time periods, especially given its relatively lower risk. When looking at its Sharpe ratio, which measures risk-adjusted returns, Zaya found that from December 2012 through November 2022, the balanced fund outperformed 97% of its peer group. \"Diversifying your portfolio with bonds has historically added stability,\" she said. \"You may sacrifice some returns ... but in the long run, it gives you a less volatile experience and can help keep an investor invested through the ups and the downs.\" Another aspect of the portfolio is its emphasis on domestic rather than overseas securities compared with peers, which are typically more internationally diversified, Zaya said. That's helped in recent years as U.S. equities outperformed international stocks. Despite the challenges of 2022, Buckley is optimistic about 2023. The fund has been watching for stocks with high yields and strong balance sheets that would help it navigate current volatility and a potential economic downturn in 2023, he said. Buckley is also expecting a \"far less dramatic\" correlation between the performance of stocks and bonds, which he hopes will provide more areas for returns in the new year. While he said tilting more toward bonds helped limit losses in 2022, he expects 2023 to be a relatively more favorable environment for stocks. \"It's going to be more of a stock-picker's market, where security selection matters even more than a kind of macro orientation of a portfolio,\" he said. \"We're doubling down on focusing on companies that we think have productivity initiatives, that have been able to invest through the pandemic, that will start to reap the rewards of that investment as we go into 2023.\"", "label": "human"}

{"text": "An Israeli far-right leader's Al-Aqsa visit sparks outrage and calls for U.N. meeting\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Atef Safadi/AP Atef Safadi/AP\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel \u2014 Israel is lobbying against calls to hold an urgent session of the United Nations Security Council, following a controversial visit by Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, to a sensitive holy site in Jerusalem.\n\nOn Tuesday, just days after Israel's new ultranationalist government took office, Ben-Gvir toured the hilltop compound that is home to the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The site is revered in Islam as the Noble Sanctuary, where the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven, but in Judaism it is called the Temple Mount, because it was the location of the biblical Temples.\n\nBen-Gvir, previously convicted in an Israeli court of ties to an anti-Arab racist organization, has long called for expanded access and rights for Jews on the hilltop. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended Ben-Gvir's visit, saying there would be no change to the status quo of the holy site. Arab countries and the U.S. warned that any unilateral changes to the way the religious site is run could spark violence.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates, a key ally of Israel, says it is pushing, with China's support, for the U.N. Security Council to discuss the situation. The Palestinian Foreign Ministry said it urged the UAE to request the meeting, and that it is expected to take place Thursday.\n\ntoggle caption Maya Alleruzzo/AP\n\nAn Israeli diplomatic official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal communications, tells NPR that Israel's Foreign Ministry instructed Israeli embassies to lobby countries against any moves the Security Council might take. Israeli news site Walla News first reported the Israeli efforts to block the proposed U.N. meeting.\n\nThe UAE was among the first Arab countries to criticize Ben-Gvir's visit to the compound, and held calls with Turkey and Jordan on the matter. Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey and Bahrain have all slammed the visit, with most of them calling it \"provocative.\"\n\nBut the UAE's outspoken criticism is particularly noteworthy, given its warm public embrace of Israel. The two countries, then under Netanyahu and President Donald Trump, opened diplomatic relations in 2020, and just last month, the UAE's ambassador to Israel hosted Ben-Gvir at an Emirati national day celebration.\n\nElham Fakhro, a Bahraini research fellow at the University of Exeter, says public opinion in the Gulf is largely opposed to Israeli actions against Palestinians, and is skeptical that formal ties with Arab states can change Israel's policies.\n\n\"I think what's happening now is there's been a maturing of the relationship between the two sides. I think the Emiratis are more confident in the relationship with Israel,\" says Fakhro, author of a forthcoming book on the U.S.-brokered deals that formalized ties between Israel and the Gulf Arab states of Bahrain and the UAE in 2020.\n\n\"They're trying to use their influence,\" she says of the UAE. \"Whether or not Netanyahu is going to be a willing partner in that is a different question.\"\n\nBen-Gvir's visit to the holy site also drew criticism within Israel from those opposed to the country's new ultranationalist government.\n\n\"It's outrageous. It's totally intolerable,\" former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert tells NPR. \"I completely understand the reaction of the international community.\"\n\nNPR's Aya Batrawy contributed to this story from Dubai.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Whenever there's a big storm in the American West, pilots are likely flying into the eye, seeding clouds with a substance called silver iodide. The goal is to increase precipitation. Cloud seeding has been around since the 1940s. It's become widespread of late as the West battles a drought of historic proportions. States, utility companies and even ski resorts are footing the bill. While it was was assumed for decades to be effective, recent studies have helped prove that cloud seeding works, and there's no evidence that silver iodide is harmful at current levels. Experts say cloud seeding generally yields a 5% to 15% increase in precipitation. It's no cure for drought, but cloud seeding can be an important water management tool. \"We can't make a storm happen and we can't create conditions in this storm that are ideal. Those happen naturally,\" said Jason Carkeet, a utility analyst and hydrologist with the Turlock Irrigation District in central California. Turlock started its cloud-seeding program in 1990. \"What we're doing is just taking advantage of existing conditions, naturally occurring conditions, and trying to make the storm again more efficient from a water supply perspective,\" Carkeet said.\n\nHow cloud seeding works\n\nWhen done aerially, cloud seeding involves loading up a plane with silver iodide. Flares are placed on the wings and fuselage. The pilot reaches a certain altitude, where temperatures are ideal, and shoots the flares into the cloud. The silver iodide causes individual water droplets within the clouds to freeze together, forming snowflakes that eventually become so heavy that they fall. Absent the freezing process, the droplets wouldn't bond together and become large enough to precipitate as either rain or snow. \"The cloud initially is all water,\" said Bruce Boe, vice president of meteorology at Weather Modification International, a private company that's been providing cloud-seeding services since 1961. \"Eventually, as it gets toward the summit of the mountain, it may be 50% ice or maybe more than that. But even if it is, there's still a lot of liquid water left there.\" Boe said there's a \"window of opportunity\" to get the precipitation big enough to fall \"before it crests the mountain and starts to descend and thus warm.\"\n\nPilot Joel Zimmer, who works for Weather Modification International, affixes silver iodide flares to the bottom of a cloud seeding plane. Katie Brigham | CNBC\n\nFor cloud-seeding pilots like Joel Zimmer, who works with Weather Modification International to seed clouds for the Turlock Irrigation District, flying into the storm can be an exhilarating but intense experience. \"By the time the wheels are up, you're in cloud,\" said Zimmer, whose route involves seeding over the Sierra Nevada mountains. \"And we're in cloud the entire mission until we're shooting an approach back into an airport and then pop out of the clouds and have a visual on the runway. It feels like you're a sub commander in the Navy. You don't see anything.\" From a water supply perspective, it's most valuable to seed clouds over mountains, where the water is essentially stored as snow until the spring runoff. \"When it's out on the plains such as North Dakota, it's still a benefit because it helps recharge soil moisture,\" Boe said. \"But it can't be stored and used for a later date.\" While Texas uses cloud seeding to help irrigate fields for farmers, it's more common in the West, where states like Idaho, California, Colorado, Utah and Wyoming use it to help fill up their rivers and reservoirs. Most programs use planes for cloud seeding, but some use ground-based flares. \"It's a lot more common than people think,\" Carkeet said. \"More basins have a seeding program than do not have a seeding program.\"\n\nCosts and impact", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Happy 50th Anniversary to the discovery of the Santa Claus rally. It's that time of year again: the Santa Claus rally. Like a lot of Wall Street mythology, this one has a lot of barnacles around it. Santa Claus rally: what it is The Santa Claus rally is a short rally that runs from the last five trading days of the year to the first two trading days of the New Year. Across that span, the S & P 500 posts an average gain of 1.3% since 1950. A 1.3% increase over seven days is much higher than the expected probability that the S & P 500 would increase by that amount over a seven-day trading period, so this is statistically significant. And it happens fairly often. According to one study, a Santa Claus rally has materialized in four out of every five years since 1950. Santa Claus rally: what it isn't Still, this is often taken as some kind of trading strategy. \"It's not a trading strategy, it's an indicator!,\" Jeff Hirsch reminded readers of the Trader's Almanac a few weeks ago. Jeff's point: failure to rally in these coming seven days tends to precede bear markets or times when stocks could be purchased later in the year at lower prices. He should know. His father, Yale Hirsch, a friend of mine for many years, discovered and named the Santa Claus rally in 1972. This year is the 50th anniversary! It's also why the rally is so closely associated with Yale's now-famous couplet: \"If Santa Claus Should Fail To Call, Bears May Come To Broad And Wall,\" (referring to the New York Stock Exchange location). Why is there a Santa Claus rally at all? Nobody knows, but there is no shortage of explanations: anticipation of new money coming into the market in January, optimism about the new year, end of year bonuses being put to work, lack of institutional trading which leaves the market to more optimistic retail traders, and even just traders anticipating a rally. All of this makes some sense, but it makes a simple assumption: that everything is relatively normal and there is no macroeconomic event that has everyone worried. That's not the case right now. Markets are obsessed with a recession in 2023. But here's an odd thing: Santa Claus rallies do occur during recessions. \"The three largest Santa Claus rallies (2008-2009, 1974-1975 and 1973-1974) occurred during recessions, as did the worst end-of-year periods (1990-1991 and 2007-2008),\" one study concluded ( https://smartasset.com/investing/santa-claus-rally-2020 ).

{"text": "As the calendar year draws to a close, many individuals in the United States are likely to consider making philanthropic contributions for 2020. Engaging in charitable activities has numerous benefits, including alleviating the struggles of those in need, reducing one's taxable income, and even optimizing tax savings.\n\nIn the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and its profound economic consequences, charitable giving has become more crucial than ever. According to the 2020 report by Giving USA, charitable donations in the United States decreased by 3.9% in 2020. Furthermore, the IRS noted that tax deductions for charitable contributions declined by 7.5% between 2017 and 2018. This underscores the significance of charitable donations in the current economic climate.\n\nFor those contemplating making a charitable donation this year, there are two effective methods to maximize one's tax deduction. The first approach involves donating cash, which is the most efficient and tax-efficient way to contribute to charity. One can deduct up to 60% of their adjusted gross income for cash donations, and the deduction can be claimed in the tax year the donation is made.\n\nThe second method involves donating appreciated securities. When donating appreciated securities, one is not only permitted to deduct the full market value of the securities but also exempt from paying capital gains tax on the appreciation. This means that one can deduct the full market value of the securities without incurring any taxes on the gains.\n\nThese two approaches are among the most effective ways to maximize one's tax deduction. Additionally, there are other methods of donating to charity, such as donating property, donating IRA assets, or establishing a Donor Advised Fund. It is essential to consult with a financial advisor or tax professional to determine the most suitable method for one's individual circumstances.\n\nWhen making charitable donations, it is crucial to itemize one's deductions and retain all receipts and documents related to the donation. Furthermore, it is essential to ensure that one is donating to a legitimate charity, particularly when considering donations to relief organizations or crowdfunding sites. One should always conduct thorough research to verify the legitimacy of the organization or individual and ensure that the donation will be used for the intended purpose.\n\nPhilanthropic giving is a valuable means of reducing one's taxable income and assisting those in need. As the year draws to a close and taxes are on everyone's mind, consider making a charitable donation to maximize one's tax deduction. With the right approach, one can make a positive impact while also optimizing their tax situation.", "label": "machine"}

Col. Matthew Shelly, an experienced A-10 pilot and the commander of the 74th Fighter Squadron, told Insider. It's only the 74th and 75th Fighter Squadrons of the 23rd Fighter Group and the 76th Fighter Squadron, once part of the 23rd but now part of a Reserve unit, at Moody Air Force Base that fly with shark's teeth.\n\n\"There are other A-10 units that have nose art, but not the iconic shark face,\" he said.\n\nFor instance, the Air Force Reserve's 442nd Fighter Wing at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri gave their A-10s Warthog teeth with tusks in 2015 after an aircraft structural maintenance technician asked, \"Why don't ours have teeth?\"\n\nAircraft 79-123 was the first A-10 Thunderbolt II flying out of the 442nd Fighter Wing at Whiteman Air Force Base, Mo., to receive teeth.

The designs ranged from teeth to pin-up models to cartoon characters.\n\nThe intake on the Curtiss P-40, an Allied fighter and ground-attack aircraft, lent itself to a shark mouth design.\n\nThe first P-40s to feature the shark mouth war paint were the British Royal Air Force Tomahawks. The design was later adopted by the Americans and featured on US P-40s, which were known as Warhawks.\n\nFor the Americans, the shark art \"started in the American Volunteer Group, which eventually became the 23rd Fighter Group,\" Shelly said.\n\nA P-40 Warhawk painted in the colors of the American Volunteer Group (Flying Tigers) at a 2018 air show.

It was only active for about a year before it was disbanded, but in that time, it destroyed 297 enemy aircraft, according to the US Air Force.\n\nTheir actions made them legends. \"They did that with P-40 aircraft,\" Shelly said. And, \"when you look at the P-40 aircraft from World War II, almost all the pictures that you look at have a shark face on it,\" he added.\n\nA P-40 Warhawk painted in the colors of the American Volunteer Group (Flying Tigers) at a 2018 air show.

People would need to make a reservation online to cross land borders, while ferries and flights are subject to ticket availability.\n\n\"Entering mainland via Hong Kong becomes a very realistic and feasible choice,\" Lee said. \"In terms of attracting foreign investment and talents it will bring a very positive effect.\"\n\nLee said the government will make an announcement about border crossing arrangements between Hong Kong and the gambling hub of Macau at a later date.\n\nPeople in Hong Kong have only been able to reach the mainland via the city's airport or just two check-points, one at Shenzhen Bay and the other via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge.\n\nMost other border points including the West Kowloon high speed rail terminus have been closed since early 2020.\n\nBefore the coronavirus emerged in China in late 2019, there were more than 236 million passenger trips over their border a year, government data showed.\n\nChina will no longer require people to present COVID tests upon arrival in the mainland from Hong Kong, while China will issue special tourism and business visas for mainland residents to visit Hong Kong from Jan. 8, the office said.\n\nChina will also increase flights between the mainland, Hong Kong and Macau, it said.\n\nHong Kong residents have flocked to clinics to get vaccinated against COVID ahead of the border reopening, which some fear could bring a surge in both infections and demand for mRNA vaccines that are not widely available in the mainland.\n\nReporting by the Beijing newsroom, Farah Master, Meg Shen and Jessie Pang in Hong Kong; Editing by Himani Sarkar, Robert Birsel and Kim Coghill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "As the 17th week of the American football season draws to a close, attention is shifting to the postseason. For some teams, this week's games will have a significant impact on their chances of advancing. Conversely, some teams have already been eliminated from contention.\n\nOne such team is the Houston Texans, who have been mathematically eliminated from the playoffs. On the other hand, the San Antonio Squad, a team with high expectations, has struggled to meet them.\n\nThe Squad was expected to have a strong season, led by quarterback Carson Wentz, a former Super Bowl MVP. However, the team's performance has been disappointing, with Wentz struggling with turnovers and poor decision-making. This has resulted in the Squad ranking near the bottom of the league in points scored per game.\n\nDespite having a talented roster, the Squad has struggled to find consistency, ultimately missing the playoffs. The biggest disappointment is Wentz, who was expected to lead the team to success. While he hasn't been as poor as some have suggested, it's still been a letdown for the Squad's organization.\n\nOn a positive note, the Squad still has a strong foundation, including a capable offensive line and a young defense that is still developing. If the Squad can address its offensive issues and get Wentz back to his MVP form, they should be competitive next season.\n\nHowever, the Squad will need to make significant improvements to contend for a championship. Rather than dwelling on what could have been this season, the team should focus on making the necessary adjustments to move forward.\n\nIf the Squad makes the right moves, they may still be one of the season's winners. While it's no surprise that Carson Wentz and the Squad didn't make the playoffs this season, there's still hope for the future.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Asylum seeking migrants from Central America sit next to a vehicle that was stopped by police after crossing the Rio Grande into Eagle Pass, Texas from Mexico along U.S. Route 90, in Hondo, Texas, U.S., June 1, 2022.\n\nA Supreme Court decision will keep in place for now a controversial Trump-era rule that allows the U.S. to deport migrants at the Mexican border as a public health measure in response to the pandemic.\n\nThe court voted 5-4 on Tuesday to grant an emergency request by 19 Republican state attorneys general who sought to intervene in defense of the policy. It also agreed to hear oral arguments in February and rule on whether the states can intervene, with a decision due by the end of June. The policy will remain in place at least until that ruling is issued.\n\n\"Title 42 is a public health measure, not an immigration enforcement measure, and it should not be extended indefinitely,\" the White House said in a statement. \"To truly fix our broken immigration system, we need Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform measures like the ones President Biden proposed on his first day in office.\"\n\nConservative Justice Neil Gorsuch joined the three liberals on the court in voting against the stay request. The brief court order said that while the administration cannot set aside the Title 42 policy, the decision \"does not prevent the federal government from taking any action with respect to that policy.\"\n\nMore than 2 million people have been deported at the southern border under the policy since 2020.\n\nIn November, a federal district court in Washington, D.C., had ordered the Department of Homeland Security to end the policy Dec. 21, criticizing the deportations as arbitrary. But Republican-led states intervened in the case and successfully petitioned the high court to block that lower court ruling. Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily blocked the Biden administration earlier this month from ending the controversial policy.\n\nThe deportation policy originated with the Trump administration. In March 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention used a provision under the Public Health Services Act, or Title 42, to prohibit migrants from crossing into the U.S. from Mexico or Canada due to the risk of them spreading Covid-19. The deportation policy is often referred to simply as Title 42.\n\nBut human rights groups and dozens of health experts fiercely criticized the policy as a way for the federal government to carry out arbitrary mass deportations at the southern border under the guise of public health.\n\nThe White House continued the policy until April 2022, when the CDC said it was longer necessary to prevent the spread of Covid. The CDC and DHS had planned for the policy to end in May, but Republican states sued and got a federal court in Louisiana to block the Biden administration from ending the deportations at that time as well.\n\nRepublicans and some Democrats argue that ending the policy will lead to a major increase in migration at the southern border that communities there are unequipped to deal with. El Paso, Texas, declared a state of emergency on Saturday in response to a recent increase in migrants crossing the border.", "label": "human"}

Dat heeft topman Andy Jassy aan de medewerkers laten weten.\n\nHet gaat om de grootste banenreductie in de geschiedenis van Amazon en is een nieuw signaal dat grote techbedrijven een omslag doormaken. In de sector zijn de laatste maanden al verschillende grote ontslagrondes aangekondigd.\n\nAmazon had in november al aangegeven dat er personeel ontslagen zou worden, waarbij de topman aangaf er aan het begin van het nieuwe jaar meer over te kunnen zeggen. Amerikaanse media meldden destijds dat het in Seattle gevestigde bedrijf zo\u2019n 10.000 banen zou gaan schrappen.\n\nDe ontslagronde is volgens Jassy noodzakelijk vanwege \u201cde onzekere economie\u201d en omdat het webwinkelconcern \u201csnel personeel had aangenomen\u201d tijdens de pandemie. Consumenten bestelden tijdens de coronapandemie massaal producten bij de webwinkel. Om aan die explosieve vraag naar leveringen te voldoen verdubbelde het wereldwijde personeelsbestand van Amazon tussen 2020 en 2022. Maar nu verwacht Amazon dus mindere tijden door de gedaalde koopkracht en mogelijke economische recessie.\n\nEen deel van de ontslagen bij Amazon zal in Europa zijn, zei Jassy, eraan toevoegend dat de getroffen werknemers vanaf 18 januari op de hoogte zullen worden gebracht. Vooral de verkooptak van Amazon en de afdeling die zich bezighoudt met de werving van nieuwe medewerkers lijken te worden getroffen.\n\nJassy zei verder dat de plotselinge aankondiging van de ontslagronde werd gedaan \"omdat een van onze teamgenoten deze informatie extern heeft gelekt\".\n\nFNV verwacht weinig impact in Nederland\n\nHet wereldwijde massaontslag bij webwinkelconcern Amazon gaat waarschijnlijk grotendeels aan Nederland voorbij, denkt vakbond FNV. Volgens FNV-bestuurder Michiel Al heeft het Amerikaanse bedrijf in Nederland maar \u00e9\u00e9n bezorgcentrum, in de buurt van Schiphol. Daar verwacht hij eigenlijk geen ontslagen zolang er in Nederland mensen zijn die artikelen blijven bestellen.\n\nAl schat dat er op het Nederlandse bezorgcentrum, een verdeelpunt voor pakketjes die uit andere distributiecentra van Amazon in Europa komen, zo'n 150 tot 200 mensen werken. Dat zijn volgens hem veelal uitzendkrachten. Verder is er voor zover de vakbondsman weet ook nog wat kantoorpersoneel aan de slag in Nederland. Hij schat dat dit gaat om tientallen mensen, maar met hen heeft FNV geen contact.\n\nDe aanwezigheid van de bond is sowieso erg beperkt bij Amazon, dat erom bekend staat vakbonden zoveel mogelijk buiten de deur te willen houden.\n\nAmazon startte pas tijdens de coronapandemie met een Nederlandse versie van zijn webwinkel. Het bezorgcentrum werd in de zomer van 2021 geopend. FNV heeft toen aangegeven ook met de leiding van het bedrijf te willen gaan praten. \"Maar ik wacht al anderhalf jaar op een uitnodiging\", zegt Al.\n\nDe FNV'er denkt dat de ingreep van Amazon in Europa vooral in Duitsland gevoeld zal worden. Dat is volgens hem de grootste Europese markt van het bedrijf. Ook sluit hij een relatief groot banenverlies in Luxemburg niet uit. \"Als het om kantoorfuncties gaat dan kan het dat Luxemburg wordt getroffen, want daar zit het Europese hoofdkantoor van Amazon.\"\n\nTechsector snijdt in het personeelsbestand\n\nDe veranderde economische situatie zorgde al eerder voor ontslagen bij technologiebedrijven. Zo zette Elon Musk recent flink het mes in het personeelsbestand van Twitter. Ook Meta, het moederbedrijf van Facebook, kondigde vorig jaar een reorganisatie aan. Daarbij verdwijnen er 11.000 banen, ongeveer 13 procent van het totale aantal arbeidskrachten. Eerder deze week werd bekend dat fabrikant van bedrijfssoftware Salesforce zijn 80.000 werknemers tellende personeelsbestand met ongeveer 10 procent wil verminderen doordat klanten voorzichtiger zijn geworden met hun uitgaven.\n\nDe ontslagronde van Amazon is wel grootste van de recente personeelsinkrimpingen in de Amerikaanse technologiesector. Maar Amazon heeft ook met afstand het meeste personeel. Het concern had eind september wereldwijd meer dan 1,5 miljoen werknemers in dienst. Dat is exclusief seizoenarbeiders die worden geworven tijdens periodes van verhoogde activiteit, met name tijdens de feestdagenperiode.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "A notable development occurred on Wednesday, as authorities in Mexico took into custody the offspring of a notorious figure notorious for his involvement in the illegal drug trade. This individual, Ovidio Guzman Lopez, 28, was apprehended by Mexican security forces in the western state of Sinaloa, according to the country's security minister. The warrant for his arrest is connected to organized crime charges, authorities stated.\n\nThis development comes amidst heightened tensions between the United States and Mexico, following the imposition of tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of Mexican goods by the outgoing Trump administration. The arrest appears to be a move by the Mexican government to bolster security ahead of the visit by the incoming U.S. administration, which is expected to focus on economic and security issues.\n\nThe United States and Mexico share a lengthy and complex border, and a desire to address cross-border drug trafficking and illegal migration. Lopez is one of the most notorious drug traffickers in Mexico, being the son of a prominent drug lord who led the Sinaloa cartel and was captured in 2016 after twice escaping from Mexican prisons.\n\nGuzman is currently serving a life sentence in the U.S. after being convicted of drug trafficking and murder-for-hire. Lopez had reportedly been in the crosshairs of Mexican and U.S. authorities for some time, with U.S. authorities seeking to extradite him from Mexico on drug trafficking charges in October 2019. However, Mexico's extradition court rejected the request, citing a \"lack of precision\" in the charges.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Mexican army, along with police forces, moved into the Sinaloa capital of Culiac\u00e1n after local gangs reportedly mobilized in support of Lopez. Although details of the raid were not immediately clear, Mexican media reported that some of Lopez's followers fired guns in the city to disrupt the operation.\n\nThe Mexican government has long struggled with drug cartels, which have proliferated in recent years, as the country grapples with violence and corruption. The fight against organized crime has been a main priority for the incoming government, with the arrests of drug lords, including Lopez, being part of its overall strategy to tackle drug-related violence, which has been on the rise in Mexico.\n\nThe incoming U.S. administration is expected to discuss cross-border security issues with their Mexican counterparts during their visit, along with trade and economic issues. While the two leaders are expected to take a more collaborative approach to issues such as immigration and drug trafficking, the Biden administration's policies towards Mexico are likely to differ from those of the Trump administration.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "As investors position their portfolios for the year ahead, one sector is a standout pick for the investment panel on CNBC's \"Halftime Report\" : financials. Financials are well-positioned to deal with volatility after preparing for a bearish scenario in 2023, according to the investment committee on Wednesday. The panel included Joe Terranova, Karen Firestone, Jenny Harrington and Jim Lebenthal. \"In every recession, there's one sector, whose balance sheet is most negatively affected by the recession. So if you go back to 2000, 2001, it was technology. Well, what happens? That sector cleans up its balance sheet. and the next recession, they're able to endure through that environment,\" said Terranova, senior managing director at Virtus Investment Partners. \"In '08, technology, best sector. So, if you think about '08, financials' most negatively impacted, cleaned up the balance sheets, I think they're gonna be resilient and recessionary environment,\" Terranova added. Gilman Hill Asset Management CEO Jenny Harrington named financial stocks as her top 2023 sector pick, saying the sector is undervalued after reviewing its price/earnings to growth ratio, or PEG ratio. Financials had the second-lowest PEG ratio among the S & P sectors, after consumer discretionary stocks. What's more, banks may have bolstered their reserves for a truly bearish scenario. \"If my friend [Jim Lebenthal] is right, and we have no recession or not a terrible recession, banks should end up doing really well next year,\" Harrington said. The financials sector in the S & P 500 was down by 12% in 2022, still outperforming the broader market index despite the drop. Similarly, Aureus Asset Management Chairman and CEO Karen Firestone chose financials as her top sector in 2023, though she specified she prefers companies apart from the big banks in the sector. Firestone named S & P Global , Charles Schwab , First Republic Bank and Blackstone as stocks that she owns, all of which are down severely after the past year. Shares of S & P Global lost 29% in 2022, while First Republic Bank plunged nearly 41%. Meanwhile, Blackstone dropped more than 42% last year. Regardless, the investor expects these stocks are more attractive in the coming year, given their higher cash flow and dividend yields. Notably, Firestone called Charles Schwab one of her top 2023 stock picks, saying the business has a lot of momentum for asset growth, and will be supported by higher interest rates. According to Firestone, \"It's an organic growth story, and we think that this multiple can sustain itself.\" The other investment panel members approved of the picks. \"I don't think we're going to have a recession,\" Cerity Partners' Lebenthal said. \"The balance sheets are in great shape, which means their lending is going to continue, and if you don't have a recession, then all that capital expenditure that you've heard me talk about for months comes to fruition.\" \"That needs financing, okay, and that financing is going to come from the banks, whether it's in loans or underwriting debt. Economic activity benefits the financials,\" Lebenthal added. Here is the full 2023 stock picks from the group: Karen Firestone: Charles Schwab, Align Technology, American Tower; Sector Pick: Financials Jenny Harrington: Kohl's, Uber, B & G Foods; Sector Pick: Financials Jim Lebenthal: Boeing, Cleveland-Cliffs, Paramount Global; Sector Pick: Industrials", "label": "human"}

Leaked passages from Spare suggest tensions go back to birth\u2014an underlying resentment of being \u201cthe spare heir\u201d, while his brother is next in line to the throne.\n\nAlexander Larman, author of The Crown in Crisis: Countdown to the Abdication and The Windsors at War: The King, His Brother and a Family Divided, argues that the two brothers tended to butt heads even before Harry left for America, stating, \u201cBoth of them are strong personalities, committed to a variety of causes and initiatives, and inevitably there have been clashes and disagreements along the way.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also a long history of such feuds. As Larman puts it, \u201cThink of James II, who began as Duke of York and then made a spectacular mess of being king [in the 1680s] after [his brother] Charles II died. Or Richard III, who, if Shakespeare is to be believed, brought about the deaths of both his brothers Edward IV and the Duke of Clarence to ascend the throne [in the 1480s], only to be forced off it by Henry VII. Nobody\u2019s thinking that Harry has had anything quite so dramatic in mind\u2026 yet, anyway.\u201d\n\nIn a new 60 Minutes interview airing in full on Jan. 8, Harry claims that one of the reasons he\u2019s going public about the drama is because the royal family\u2019s relationship to the British press has made it impossible for him to have the private conversations necessary to mend his relationship with his father and his brother.\n\n\u201cEvery single time I\u2019ve tried to do it privately, there have been briefings and leakings and planting of stories against me and my wife,\u201d Harry tells Anderson Cooper.\n\nIn a separate interview on U.K. broadcaster iTV, which airs a few hours before 60 Minutes, Harry argues that his father and his brother do not want to make amends. \u201cI would like to get my father back, I would like to have my brother back,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve shown absolutely no willingness to reconcile.\u201d\n\nIn a six-part Netflix docu-series Harry & Meghan that debuted in December, Harry revealed that William screamed at him during a family meeting with his father and his grandmother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, shortly after Harry announced his desire to give up royal duties. Harry also claimed that he didn\u2019t consent to a joint statement that the royal family put out in the brothers\u2019 name to debunk rumors that William was bullying Harry. He claimed that the royal family\u2019s staffers were willing to \u201clie to protect my brother\u201d and his alleged misdeeds, but \u201cfor three years they were never willing to tell the truth to protect us,\u201d meaning Meghan and himself.\n\nThe feud between the brothers is also about more than just their relationship with one another.\n\n\u201cThe traditional ascription to the ill-will between William and Harry is that neither of their wives like one another and that has driven a wedge between them, coupled with a sense on William\u2019s part that his younger brother has behaved irresponsibly and selfishly in abandoning any sense of duty by staging his quasi-abdication,\u201d says Larman.\n\nHarry has not been totally cut off from his father and brother. Shortly after Oprah Winfrey interviewed Harry and Markle in March 2021, journalist Gayle King\u2014a friend of Winfrey and Markle\u2014told People that Harry talked to his father and brother after the interview, but that the conversation was \u201cnot productive.\u201d Harry had told Oprah that his father stopped taking his calls at one point.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the family will come together in a public show of unity before King Charles III\u2019s coronation ceremony on May 6. Larman notes that Harry has chosen to air his family\u2019s dirty laundry, arguing, \u201cToday, we might not see royal brothers meeting on the field of battle, winner taking all, but instead we find them conducting their warfare via that rather more insidious weapon\u2014the media\u2014and hoping that the court of public opinion will favor one side over the other in a hopefully definitive way.\u201d\n\nWrite to Olivia B.

{"text": "A sign at the Nahant Thicket Wildlife Sanctuary warns people about coyotes, in Nahant, Mass., Dec. 28, 2022. (Sophie Park/The New York Times)\n\nNAHANT, Mass. \u2014 When coyotes approach children playing in the park, as they do with unnerving frequency in this tiny coastal town north of Boston, Kellie Frary springs into action, trying to drive the animals off while another adult quickly gathers Frary\u2019s day care group.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to have to make that phone call, to tell a parent, \u2018The coyote picked your kid,\u2019\u201d said Frary, a lifelong resident of Nahant, where 3,000 people inhabit 1 square mile.\n\nNo humans have been harmed by Nahant\u2019s coyotes, estimated to number about a dozen. But after the disappearances of more than two dozen pets in roughly two years \u2014 and reports of three brazen, fatal attacks in 2022 on leashed dogs accompanied by their owners \u2014 the town is ever more on edge. Its isolated geography \u2014 Nahant is essentially an island connected to the mainland by a narrow, 1.5-mile causeway \u2014 contributes to the sense of menace felt by some residents.\n\nSign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times\n\nCompact, densely populated and surrounded by water, it is a hard place for coyotes to leave, and a hard place for them to remain mostly invisible to humans, as they often do in cities and more sprawling suburbs, wildlife experts said.\n\nEarly in December, Nahant\u2019s three-member Board of Selectmen voted to enlist federal sharpshooters to track and kill some of the coyotes, making Nahant the first municipality in Massachusetts to seek the expert help through a new state partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nThe plan has relieved many anxious residents, some of whom now carry whistles and baseball bats on strolls around town, and dress their dogs in $100 \u201ccoyote jackets\u201d covered with metal spikes to repel attacks.\n\n\u201cI love animals, and I don\u2019t want to see them killed, but some child on a porch is going to get taken,\u201d said Lisa Wrenn, who watched a coyote snatch her 12-pound Chihuahua, Penelope, off a leash last summer as she stood on her front stairs. Left holding the leash and empty collar, she never saw the dog again, she said.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough coyotes regard small pets as prey, attacks on people are rare and almost never fatal, according to coyote experts.\n\nSupport for the sharpshooting plan is not unanimous. Opponents have argued for a more humane approach, hoisting handmade \u201cSave the Nahant Coyotes\u201d signs near the causeway into town.\n\nFrancene Amari-Faulkner, a resident who has organized protests against the plan, said false claims and exaggeration have fueled hysteria and a rush to drastic measures. \u201cIf the town brings in sharpshooters, it\u2019s going to be a bloodbath,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause then other towns will say, \u2018We can do that too.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlthough a coyote problem on a peninsula jutting into the sea may be less than typical, human aversion to the species is well established. Coyotes have long been viewed as a nuisance, and millions have been poisoned, shot and trapped by frustrated or frightened humans trying to control their population. But their signature trait may be their persistence. By the 1950s, they had pushed east into Massachusetts; by 2000, they were present everywhere in the state except the islands of Nantucket and Martha\u2019s Vineyard, according to the state Division of Fisheries and Wildlife.\n\nTony Barletta, Nahant\u2019s town administrator, takes pains to remind residents that there is no going back: Coyotes will remain, long after a handful are eliminated. And like it or not, residents will have to find a way to live alongside them.\n\n\u201cWe fully expect to have them here in town,\u201d Barletta said at a recent meeting of the Board of Selectmen. \u201cJust because you\u2019re afraid of coyotes doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a problem, and that\u2019s a tough thing to explain to residents.\u201d\n\nMassachusetts offers fewer checks on the coyote population than many other places, with its abbreviated hunting season, local rules against discharging firearms and ban on most effective traps, enacted by a ballot referendum in 1996.\n\nIn South Carolina, 25,000 to 30,000 coyotes are killed by hunting and trapping every year, while in Massachusetts, the annual total is around 500, said Dave Wattles, a biologist with the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife. Yet even in the South, he said, hunting has little impact on coyote numbers, known for rebounding rapidly from any dips.\n\nAs local encounters with the animals have multiplied \u2014 residents share videos of coyotes patrolling their porches on a Facebook page called \u201cNahant Coyote Victims\u201d \u2014 theories have multiplied. Some locals believe the omnivorous creatures have wiped out all the island\u2019s resident skunks and raccoons (rabbits have somehow persisted), and are hungrily stalking homes with pets, looking for food.\n\nState and local authorities stress that attacks on off-leash pets are normal coyote behavior, unfortunate but not concerning. But in targeting dogs on leashes, coyotes in Nahant have deviated from normal patterns, indicating decreased fear of humans, Wattles said. Those attacks prompted the state to authorize the town to seek federal intervention to kill some animals.\n\nBecause there is no way for sharpshooters to identify the most aggressive, they will probably use trial and error, killing several and then waiting to see if atypical behaviors subside.\n\nExperts say it will fall to the people of Nahant to reinstill a healthy fear of humans in the remaining coyotes \u2014 and that will require overcoming their own fear.\n\n\u201cIf humans act submissive toward them, and run away, it teaches them they\u2019re the king of Nahant,\u201d Wattles said during an educational meeting hosted by the town for residents in July. \u201cYou have to teach them you\u2019re a threat, and they\u2019re not welcome.\u201d\n\nBy engaging in ongoing harassment known as \u201chazing,\u201d he said \u2014 chasing coyotes; spraying them with water; throwing sand or gravel at them; screaming and banging pots and pans to disrupt them \u2014 residents can reestablish boundaries.\n\nBut after seeing little impact from attempts at hazing, some residents worry it may be too late.\n\nMichael Hanlon, a part-time resident of the town, said he \u201cyelled bloody murder\u201d and swung a 3-foot stick at three coyotes who circled him and his dog Dewey on a residential street one recent night, but the animals only retreated a few feet.\n\nHanlon retreated into his house.\n\n\u201cThey have no fear at all,\u201d said Frary, the day care provider, whose 12-year-old Pekingese poodle, Brody, reluctantly dons a spiked vest on walks. \u201cIt\u2019s like a teacher who was lenient, and then tries to be strict. \u2026 They\u2019re used to us now, and it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nShe said coyotes have been known to laze in the sun on the local golf course, watching players putt. Linda Tanfani, another resident, complained to town officials after loitering coyotes cast a pall over her game of pickleball.\n\n\u201cWhen they\u2019re ruling over us, controlling our lives, it\u2019s not right,\u201d Tanfani said at the select board meeting. \u201cI\u2019m tense all the time.\u201d\n\nWildlife experts say most coyote aggression toward humans stems from people providing the animals with food, which can drastically alter their behavior. In Arlington, a Boston suburb that saw three nonfatal coyote attacks on children in 2021, police later determined that a resident had been feeding a coyote. Officers killed the animal, and the town has had no problems since, a spokesperson said.\n\nA coyote attack can be so stealthy, it has been mistaken for something more mundane. John Malafronte, a driver for a clothing donation company, was standing in a parking lot in Swampscott, Massachusetts \u2014 across the bay from Nahant \u2014 early one morning in June, smoking a cigarette and texting on his phone, when he felt a pinch and reached to swat what he thought was a fly biting his leg.\n\nWhen he glanced down and saw a coyote instead, \u201cI flipped my lid,\u201d said Malafronte, who suffered a puncture wound and later received rabies shots.\n\nStanley Gehrt, at the Chicago-based Urban Coyote Research Project, has studied coyotes for decades, tracking hundreds of them to learn how they live. He acknowledges that removing coyotes may be appropriate in some situations, but he also reminds nervous suburbanites about the coyote\u2019s role in a healthy ecosystem.\n\nCoyotes can help control populations of rodents, rabbits and Canada geese, Gehrt said; they also prey on white-tailed deer, which cause car accidents and endanger drivers.\n\nCoyotes also offer humans a bracing dose of humility, he noted.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done everything we can to wipe them off the continent for 150 years, and they\u2019re moving into our backyards,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder that we don\u2019t have control of everything.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 2022 The New York Times Company", "label": "human"}

She and the other top 10 CNN Heroes honored at Sunday\u2019s gala all receive a $10,000 cash award and, for the first time, additional grants, organizational training and support from The Elevate Prize Foundation through a new collaboration with CNN Heroes.

She began her studies there with almost no experience with computers, handwriting papers and struggling to transcribe them onto a laptop.\n\nEverything changed in her junior year, though, when Cheboi took a programming course required for her mathematics major.\n\n\u201cWhen I discovered computer science, I just fell in love with it. I knew that this is something that I wanted to do as my career, and also bring it to my community,\u201d she told CNN.\n\nMany basic computer skills were still a steep learning curve, however. Cheboi remembers having to practice touch-typing for six months before she could pass a coding interview. Touch-typing is a skill that is now a core part of the TechLit curriculum.\n\n\u201cI feel so accomplished seeing kids that are 7 years old touch-typing, knowing that I just learned how to touch-type less than five years ago,\u201d she said.\n\nOnce she had begun working in the software industry, Cheboi soon realized the extent of which computers were being thrown away as companies upgraded their technology infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWe have kids here (in Kenya) \u2014 myself included, back in the day \u2014 who don\u2019t even know what a computer is,\u201d she said.\n\nSo, in 2018, she began transporting donated computers back to Kenya \u2014 in her personal luggage, handling customs fees and taxes herself.\n\n\u201cAt one point, I was bringing 44 computers, and I paid more for the luggage than I did for the air ticket,\u201d she said.\n\nA year later, she co-founded TechLit Africa with a fellow software engineer after both quit their jobs. The nonprofit accepts computer donations from companies, universities and individuals.\n\nThe hardware is wiped and refurbished before it\u2019s shipped to Kenya. There, it\u2019s distributed to partner schools in rural communities, where students ages 4 to 12 receive daily classes and frequent opportunities to learn from professionals, gaining skills that will help improve their education and better prepare them for future jobs.\n\n\u201cWe have people who own a specific skill coming in and are just inspiring the kids (with) music production, video production, coding, personal branding,\u201d Cheboi said. \u201cThey can go from doing a remote class with NASA on education to music production.\u201d\n\nThe organization currently serves 10 schools; within the next year, Cheboi hopes to be partnered with 100 more.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that when the first TechLit kids graduate high school, they\u2019re able to get a job online because they will know how to code, they will know how to do graphic design, they will know how to do marketing,\u201d Cheboi said. \u201cThe world is your oyster when you are educated.

{"text": "The investment case for Best Buy looks murky as retailers face a slowing consumer spending environment, according to Bank of America. Analyst Elizabeth Suzuki downgraded shares of the consumer electronics retailer to underperform from neutral, saying in a note to clients Wednesday that recession fears in 2023 threaten to put a damper on Best Buy's potential for positive earnings growth. The stock shed 3% following the downgrade. \"We believe it is in a strong position in core products and should have opportunities to expand into new categories going forward, although a medium-term pullback on discretionary retail categories presents a headwind to both sales growth and valuation,\" she wrote. Best Buy shares have come under significant pressure this year as retailers grapple with high inflation and a pullback in consumer spending. The stock's down more than 17% year to date, with Bank of America's $69 price target suggesting shares could fall another 18% from Tuesday's close. Suzuki's price target suggests that stock trades at 10 times the bank's 2024 earnings per share forecast, which is below the historic averages for both Best Buy and the hardline retail sector. \"We believe this discount is warranted given the pressure on consumer discretionary spending in light of inflation,\" she wrote. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting", "label": "human"}
{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Calling it among \"the most significant\u201d recent laws to be enacted, President Joe Biden on Friday touted legislation he signed in August that expanded health care benefits for veterans suffering from exposure to toxic burn pits.\n\nThe new law, dubbed the PACT Act, \"empowers the VA to move more quickly to determine if a veteran qualifies for the benefits of the law,\u201d Biden said at a National Guard and Reserve center in New Castle, Del., named after his late son, Beau Biden. \u201cAnd the benefits are real, they\u2019re real benefits like exposure screening. \u2026 It means new facilities, new research, more health care workers at VA hospitals.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor families who suffer the ultimate loss, that means potential access to life insurance, tuition benefits, home loan assistance, monthly stipends \u2014 and it\u2019s real, it\u2019s not small,\u201d he said.\n\nThe issue is personal for Biden, who has said he believes his son's brain cancer was linked to exposure to burn pits during his deployment to Iraq in 2008. In his remarks, Biden said he remembered when Beau, who was diagnosed in 2013, called him to say he had collapsed while running.\n\nSince Biden signed the law, more than 185,000 veterans have applied for benefits, the White House said. More than 730,000 veterans have also received screenings for toxic exposure, with nearly 39% reporting concern of exposure.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs began processing claims for terminally ill veterans Monday, with about 2,500 claims from veterans self-identifying as such, the White House said. The government will begin processing claims for all other veterans in January.\n\nThe law gives veterans exposed to burn pits access to more medical care and disability payments. It also requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to presume some lung illnesses and cancers were related to exposure, meaning veterans don\u2019t have to prove they got sick from the burn pits to receive compensation. Previously, about 70% of disability claims related to burn pits were denied by the VA due to lack of evidence, scientific data and information from the Department of Defense, the Associated Press reported.\n\nBiden said he has directed the Department of Veterans Affairs to treat the 23 presumptive conditions in the law immediately. \u201cI\u2019m urging all veterans of these decades of war to enroll in the VA health care to get screened for toxic exposure and to promptly file your claim,\u201d he said.\n\nBiden spoke about the danger posed by the pits, saying \u201cit\u2019s a hole between eight and 10 feet high, 12 feet deep, the size of a football field, great big rectangle, and every damn ugly thing in our world is burned in it.\u201d\n\nMany of the best-trained, fittest warriors in the world have come home to the U.S. from deployments \u201cwith headaches, numbness, dizziness, cancer,\u201d he said.\n\nExperts have said that while it is difficult to draw a definitive link between burn pit exposure and certain health problems like cancer and asthma, long-term exposure to toxic smoke can lead to serious health issues.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The House Administration Committee has released transcripts of interviews with former President Donald Trump's top aides regarding the pro-Trump rally held on the day of the Capitol insurrection. The transcripts provide a detailed account of the events leading up to the January 6 riot, as well as new revelations about Trump's interest in trademarking the phrase \"Rigged Election!\" and additional security measures he wanted to take at the rally.\n\nTrump's interest in trademarking the phrase \"Rigged Election!\" was discussed in a December 16 phone call with his campaign's chief of staff and political director, Michael Glassner. Glassner told Trump that he had begun the process of trademarking the phrase, and Trump replied that it was a \"great thing.\" Glassner also suggested that Trump could market \"Rigged Election!\" merchandise on the campaign website, which Trump approved.\n\nThe transcripts also revealed that Trump was interested in selling \"Stop the Steal\" merchandise on the campaign website, a phrase associated with the false narrative of the 2020 election being stolen from him.\n\nIn addition, the transcripts showed that Trump wanted additional security measures for the January 6 rally, including hiring 1,000 additional law enforcement officers. However, the Secret Service refused to take these measures, citing a lack of adequate resources and staff.\n\nThe rally was largely peaceful until violence erupted and a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol shortly before the counting of the electoral votes was scheduled to begin. The transcripts showed that the Trump team discussed holding the rally at the White House and that Trump had asked for access to the roof of the Capitol building, requests that were not granted.\n\nThe transcripts also revealed that the Trump team discussed postponing the rally due to the impending impeachment vote. However, Trump ultimately decided to move forward with the rally.\n\nThe testimony of Trump aides and former administration officials presented to the House panel paints a clear picture of a president who wanted to send a message with his rally, one that was ultimately overshadowed by the violence that would later ensue on the Capitol grounds.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Global thermal energy consumption is poised to reach an unprecedented level this year, according to the International Energy Agency's latest report.\n\nThe report, titled \"Thermal 2020,\" indicates that demand for thermal energy in 2020 is on track to reach a record high of 8.4 billion units of thermal equivalent (UTE), representing a 3.4% increase from 2019. This marks a continuation of the rising thermal energy demand seen in recent years, with global thermal energy consumption increasing in each of the previous three years.\n\nThe report attributes the increase to the ongoing expansion of thermal power plants in some of the world's most populous countries, as well as a rebound in demand from industrial users. The demand growth was particularly notable in Asia, where new capacity in countries such as India and Vietnam drove the sector's resurgence.\n\nAccording to the report, the world's top three thermal energy-consuming countries\u2014China, India, and the United States\u2014were likely to combine for over two-thirds of global thermal energy demand in 2020. However, the report warns that the countries' reliance on thermal energy could cause a longer-term energy transition problem if current trends continue unchecked.\n\n\"Unless policies to accelerate a shift away from thermal energy are implemented quickly, our latest outlook shows that global thermal energy capacity and related CO2 emissions will keep increasing to 2040,\" said Dr. Fatih Birol, the IEA's executive director.\n\nThe IEA's warning comes as concerns over the environment and climate change continue to mount. In recent years, governments around the world have sought to reduce emissions from thermal power plants, but progress has been slow.\n\nThe IEA said governments should take stronger action to accelerate the thermal energy transition, including encouraging investments in renewable energy and phasing out thermal energy subsidies. The agency also noted that thermal energy could still play a role in the energy transition, if the sector were to develop low-carbon technologies such as carbon capture and storage.\n\nThe IEA's report comes amid increasing calls from environmental activists for governments to take more decisive action to phase out thermal energy. Last month, the United Nations Environmental Programme warned that the world needed to make \"transformative\" changes to its energy systems in order to meet its climate goals.\n\nAt the same time, however, the IEA said that it was important to note that thermal energy still played a significant role in the global energy mix, accounting for around 27% of global primary energy demand. This was down slightly from the 2019 level of 29%, but still a significant share, the agency said.\n\n\"While a significant share of the global energy system is still dependent on thermal energy, our latest analysis shows that the tide is turning,\" said Dr. Birol. \"More and more countries are setting clear commitments to accelerate the transition away from thermal energy and, despite the remarkable rebound this year, global thermal energy demand is set to remain below its previous peak and to keep declining over the next two decades.\"", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Noah likes to feed the squirrels naked. I don\u2019t know if he does it this way when I am not here. But like clockwork on the weekend mornings we spend together, the squirrels will start to tap on the window. And Noah will rise from the bed as if responding to a baby monitor. He will stumble to the kitchen, grab a handful of unsalted almonds from a jar in the cabinet, return to the bedroom, and crack the window an inch, popping the almonds out one by one so they land on the sill in a line.\n\nThe squirrels live in the saw-whet owl nesting house he bought and placed on the corner of his fire escape. For a few hours each morning, they pad back and forth across the windowsill, balancing on the black steel ribbons of the landing, waiting for him to put out breakfast, then second breakfast, then snack. If no almonds are waiting for them on the sill, the squirrels will knock loudly on the window until he wakes up. They stand on their hind legs like tiny Peeping Toms and stare at us in bed until food appears. They will knock and stare if we are sleeping, or reading, or having sex.\n\nA poem by Ellen Bass: \u2018The Squirrel\u2019\n\nThe squirrel house is made of cedar and has a hunter-green composite roof. When Noah first showed it to me while lying in bed one afternoon, I didn\u2019t pay much attention. I\u2019m a single mother living in the Long Island suburbs, while Noah is a single man in his 40s in Brooklyn. We are both divorced. Spending $60 on a small house that may or may not get used by squirrels seemed frivolous to me, but in the middle of the pandemic, any kind of distraction also felt worth it.\n\nNoah was far from the only person taking solace in squirrels during the pandemic. Around this time, in May 2020, we watched Mark Rober\u2019s video \u201cBackyard Squirrel Maze 1.0 -Ninja Warrior Course\u201d on YouTube. After cadres of the small animals destroyed his squirrel-proof backyard bird feeders, Rober built a course designed to challenge the squirrels\u2019 mental and physical abilities. Those that made it to the end received the prize of \u201ca butt-ton of walnuts.\u201d The video has 107 million views.\n\nMany of those views came from my own household. During the first year and a half of the pandemic, I spent my weekdays away from Noah\u2019s place in my apartment with my two children. Third and fourth grade, then fourth and fifth grade, took place in the living room via Google Classroom, while I taught my college courses over Zoom in my bedroom. I could also watch squirrels chase one another through the branches of the towering old oak tree in my backyard, but they never came close enough to feed. I was more interested in birds, anyway. Noah bought us a glossy blue egg-shaped feeder to hang from the tree.\n\nThe first few days, the kids enjoyed watching the birds land and chatter while they ate the seed. The kids\u2019 teachers would be droning desperately on the computer, but my sons would be looking outside, entranced by the bird dramas. They would report their sightings of cardinals and mourning doves and finches when we all came to the table for lunch each day.\n\nOne morning, the glossy blue egg was hanging sideways by its steel string. A pile of birdseed was on the ground, and squirrels were munching away. I shooed them off, repaired the feeder, strung it back up. From my bedroom upstairs, I watched as a squirrel climbed the oak\u2019s trunk until he was parallel to the bird feeder, and then he launched himself onto the orb. Over and over, he would jump and skitter and flop off. Over and over, he would climb back up, adjusting his height and angle, until he finally stuck his landing. Stretching his body vertically so that he hung nearly upside down, the squirrel worked the metal dish and dowel at the bottom of the feeder until birdseed was scattered everywhere.\n\nA few mornings later, I came downstairs to make coffee, and the feeder itself was lying on the ground atop a giant pile of seed. Birds and squirrels were enjoying the party. I walked out with my coffee cup to assess the damage, shaking my head but also marveling at the ingenuity of the little bastards. I went to refill the feeder, but when I pulled out the plastic bin I used to store seed, I discovered that the handle had been chewed off. Apparently, the squirrels had found the source and feasted on that too.\n\nNoah first noticed his squirrels because a neighbor a few floors up kept a bird feeder on the fire escape. Every morning and afternoon, the squirrels would scamper up and down the steps, chasing the rain of seeds that would pour forth when one or another shook the feeder vigorously. When he was suddenly working from home every day, alone in the quarantine months, these squirrels would often be the only living beings he saw for days. The squirrels would pause at his window to eat the birdseed, and he enjoyed watching how they perched on the edge of the ironwork and observed the dogs and humans going by on the sidewalk. They became part of his day, and so he thought about how to make them more comfortable, how to make them stay.\n\nFrom the October 2021 issue: An ode to squirrels\n\nIn an article about the history of squirrels in New York, Sadie Stein wrote that in 1968 100,000 drowned squirrels were pulled out of a reservoir. This mass death was linked to a phenomenon that occurred across the eastern United States called the Great Squirrel Migration. After a robust year for acorns in 1967, squirrel births skyrocketed. Unfortunately, that plenty was temporary; 1968 was an unusually bad year for acorns, and it is likely that squirrels left their usual homes in search of more food. In September of that year, hundreds of thousands died on highways, or while crossing bodies of water. Squirrels are not agile swimmers, using a kind of doggy-paddle technique that requires a lot of energy to cross a short distance, and they are known to die of exhaustion when crossing bodies of water.\n\nThe squirrels migrated because they were desperate. I worried that Noah was like their 1967 bounty\u2014unreliable and temporary. When we went away on vacation for a week, he asked his friend Ryan to stop by to water his plants and feed the squirrels. As the weeks passed, we named the squirrels, and every few months they seemed to change up, with different squirrels taking ownership of the house. Noah calmed my anxiety about dependence by reporting back that while the squirrels usually eat the first few nuts they grab, they also collected nuts and ran down to the apartment building\u2019s lawn to bury them. They were storing their caches. They seemed to know it is not safe to rely on a single source of sustenance.\n\nIn our respective divorces, Noah and I had both lost places we\u2019d loved. We\u2019d both had the experience of feeling at home, of feeling like we\u2019d found the place we\u2019d be for the long term. We also knew what it meant to have to pack up and leave. His ex-wife still lived in his old apartment. A new family had moved into my house after my ex-husband and I agreed to sell it. I\u2019m not sure which is worse.\n\nHe\u2019d had squirrels at his previous apartment too, though he had not cultivated them\u2014there was a fallow planter on his fire-escape ledge, and one morning he woke up to a bundle of sleeping squirrels curled around one another. I think this was when he first fell in love with them.\n\nFor most of our relationship, we both lived in what we called our in-between places, him in Brooklyn, me in the suburbs. We both missed our old homes; we both felt unsettled where we were. Our current apartments were pass-throughs, and we knew it, though we didn\u2019t know what we were passing through to.\n\nNoah and I had been talking about moving in together before COVID hit, but every time the discussion circled too closely to reality, one or the other of us would balk. I\u2019d never introduced the kids to anyone I\u2019d dated before. Noah and I dated for two years before he met them, and then the four of us went climbing together, and running, and to the zoo. Noah and I were moving toward something, but with no timeline. Until the pandemic, we\u2019d both enjoyed living on our own, were ambivalent about marriage, were working on ourselves after our respective shipwrecks. Neither of us was in a hurry to change anything.\n\nMy maternal great-grandfather had a summer cottage in Tappan, New York, where he kept gardens. He used to treat the squirrels like pets, my mother remembers, and would often walk around his garden with a squirrel on his shoulder or perched on his hat, as he fed the animal nuts from his pocket.\n\nBut squirrels are not pets. One day, while riding on my grandfather\u2019s head, a squirrel sunk its claws into the side of my great-grandfather\u2019s face and ripped it apart. This is one of the few stories I know about the man: He worked for a French steamship company, he loved his gardens and his granddaughter and squirrels, and one of them nearly took out his eye.\n\nRead: Admit it, squirrels are just tree rats\n\nI imagine him strolling in his gardens before that awful morning, smiling contentedly while making his granddaughter giggle by tossing peanuts to the squirrel on his shoulder. I imagine he might have thought I have everything I wanted, the same way Noah and I did for a period in our respective homes before our divorces. When you live with a person you love, you think you have an understanding; you think We\u2019re in this together and Things will always feel this good. I imagine my great-grandfather\u2019s pride must have stung along with his face that day, the same way mine stung when I signed away my farmhouse. We both should have known better.\n\nNoah promised he would never open the window more than an inch to pop a nut out onto the sill, would never try to pet them. I mostly believed him. From what I could see, Noah and the squirrels seemed content to live alongside each other. The squirrels munched happily on the fire escape as Noah sat and chatted to them from the other side of the window. Sometimes, if a storm blew the nesting house too close to the open ledge, Noah would poke the green handle of his broomstick out of the window and nudge it securely into the corner of the fire escape again.\n\nAccording to National Geographic, there are more than 200 types of squirrels in the world. Many people consider them akin to chipmunks or bunnies, but make no mistake: They are in the rodent family and, like rats, their front teeth never stop growing. In New York City, the Parks Department notes that the majority of the squirrels we see are eastern gray squirrels, though they are not necessarily gray. Often they make their homes in trees, stitching together a palace of leaves called a drey. There is typically enough room for two squirrels in a drey, and a male and female might share the space during mating season. The females nest alone when pregnant. They usually give birth to a brood of two to six babies in winter, and another in summer.\n\nMother squirrels with babies are often described as living alone. By the time the pandemic hit, I had lived with my children for five years, and I certainly never felt like I lived alone. Even on the weekends they spent with their father, they remained present in our place through the drawings taped to the walls, the stray socks they peel and fling around the living room while doing homework or watching television, the drawer of multicolored children\u2019s cutlery next to the adult stainless-steel forks and knives. And yet, during the pandemic, when friends would text to check up on me, I realized this is how many saw me: living alone, with children. Squirrels and humans, it seems, require an adult partner in order to be considered not alone.\n\nThis aloneness was a bitter topic between Noah and me during the pandemic. As alone as I might have seemed, Noah was actually alone. And no amount of Facetime or texting could change that. I was jealous of this. After days of teaching in my room; preparing breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner, and dessert; overseeing Zoom elementary school and homework, getting the kids out for walks or to throw a ball; bingeing Survivor or the next Wings of Fire book, all I wanted was a minute alone. All Noah wanted was a minute with me.\n\nI felt alternately smothered and cozy. Every week I\u2019d oversee our homelife. Every other weekend, I\u2019d drive the children to their father\u2019s and then continue on to Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn. During the first year of the pandemic, Noah\u2019s apartment was an oasis. Noah is tidy, loves clean lines, is a phenomenal cook. Years earlier, the first night I stayed over, he\u2019d made me breakfast in his underwear. This was in his old apartment, the one he\u2019d bought when he was still married, before the divorce was finalized and the apartment became hers. I sat perched on the stool at the big marble island and told myself over and over, Just sit here and enjoy this. I watched him from the other side of the island as he moved between chopping vegetables and whisking what he called \u201chotel eggs\u201d in the double boiler\u2014his face set in concentration, a clutch of black hair falling in his eyes\u2014and was content.\n\nI feel the same way when he feeds the squirrels. I turn in bed to watch him. He is dutiful and precise and talks to them as he delivers the almonds. He experimented with walnuts and peanuts, but the squirrels seem to prefer almonds. \u201cIt\u2019s pear day!\u201d he announced one morning, sliding slices of pear out onto the windowsill. \u201cWait your turn,\u201d he\u2019ll chide if two begin to bicker. When he spots a squirrel with two long rows of pink nipples, it makes him happy knowing there are going to be babies. He leaves cotton balls out for the mama to insulate her nest in the winter, and the stuffing soon pokes out between the cedar slats of the nesting house.\n\nNoah is a caretaker. The first winter in his pass-through apartment, mice invaded. He used glue traps and, multiple mornings before work each week, he placed a frightened mouse in a cardboard box and carted it over to a patch of grass near a horse stable, where he would pull a vial of olive oil out of his pocket and grease the creature\u2019s feet until it could free itself from the glue and scamper off. He did this over and over until the building management finally repaired the wall behind his dishwasher where the mice were getting in. At the end of her life, Noah\u2019s geriatric Italian greyhound could no longer make the jump up to the bed. She could relax only when Noah was next to her, so he slept on the floor. For months.\n\nRead: Squirrels are professional eavesdroppers\n\nI believe, wholeheartedly, in snap-traps. I don\u2019t think I would sleep on the floor for months for a dog. I questioned my capacity to care for other humans until I became a mother. Not much about that came naturally\u2014I never felt comfortable with baby talk or babies, generally, and I often joke that I do not like children, only mine. But the love, the care, the putting them first\u2014these things became simply part of my body, the same way my children were.\n\nOnce, at the farmhouse, I fell down the porch stairs while carrying my second son in the crook of one arm and pruning shears in the other. The baby was in that squishy-all-over phase; even his skull was still soft. My ankle twisted at the top of the porch, and without thinking or trying, I tossed the shears to the side as we tumbled, twisting my body so that I was between the baby and the bluestone slab beneath us. He was so much lighter than me that he inhabited a different gravitational force, and for a moment, we were like acrobats, reaching for one another across the air. And then I was on the ground on my back, and he was on my chest, and we were both so stunned that it took a moment for us to cry.\n\nIn addition to my children, I want to care for another person like that on purpose. I want it to be intentional, not reflex. A person I choose, not a person who is an extension of my own body.\n\nWhen we found the house we wanted to buy together, it was a surprise. When we put an offer in, we didn\u2019t expect for it to go through\u2014this was in the height of the 2022 real-estate boom. We were the last appointment of the weekend to see the small yellow cape on a corner lot. It was surrounded by gardens and flowering trees. When Noah saw the amount of natural light in the kitchen, he turned to me. \u201cI think this might be our house,\u201d he whispered.\n\nWe were surprised again when, a week later, we were under contract. The reality of what we\u2019d done began to set in. There was anxiety and fear. Mostly, though, we were excited to wake up together each morning, excited to begin living in a home that felt like it was more than a pass-through.\n\nThat following weekend, as usual, I dropped the children at their father\u2019s apartment and made my way to Ocean Parkway. After a candlelit dinner with wine discussing paint colors and lawyers, we went to bed. And at 6 a.m., like clockwork, a small tapping on the window woke us up.\n\nI opened my eyes. Noah was already rising from the bed. He cracked the window and said good morning; it was the squirrel we\u2019d named Racecar a few weeks earlier because of the strange stripe of fur missing down her back, as if someone had taken a razor and just ran it along her body from her head to her tail. When the squirrel had first shown up, we\u2019d thought it was a male, but soon nipples popped out like little pink buttons. It was April. The gestation period of a gray squirrel is about 40 days. She\u2019d probably give birth in June, around our fifth anniversary. Around our closing date. Around the time Noah would need to leave his apartment. The squirrel accepted the treats, and Noah returned to bed.\n\nHe looked at me, then looked back at the squirrel munching on her breakfast. \u201cI know,\u201d he sighed.\n\nA group of squirrels is called a scurry. A family of squirrels is called a drey. When I learned this term, I thought it must be incorrect, but the word for a squirrel home and a squirrel family are, in fact, the same.\n\nNoah is afraid that he will not be able to enter the circle of closeness between my children and me, that it will always be the three of us and him, rather than simply us, all four together. I am not able to confidently erase this fear for him. Home has meant the three of us for many years now. We enjoy it; I like living alone with my children. To me, this seemed like the best way to ensure our survival. But as I watch the way things flourish under Noah\u2019s care, I\u2019m not convinced that my theory holds up.\n\nI imagine our new house, with the children\u2019s socks tucked in the couch corners and their art on the walls, Noah\u2019s rescue cactus in some sunlit corner, hotel eggs on the stove. I will try to hang the glossy blue bird feeder again, and Noah will find new squirrels. I hope that this home will be one of safety and security, of caretaking and caregiving, of joy and helping one another grow. But I know the statistics. Although they can live up to 12 years in the wild, only 25 percent of gray squirrels survive their first year. Success rates for second marriages are almost equally dire. I don\u2019t plan on marrying again, but I recognize that my magical thinking (if we don\u2019t get married, we won\u2019t get divorced!) can\u2019t keep us safe in the way I might hope.\n\nAs we research strategies to soften the blow of Noah\u2019s leaving on his squirrels, I stumble upon a hopeful fact. Squirrels typically keep a second drey nearby. They know their nests are fragile, prone to predators or storms or mite infestations, and so they have a backup plan, the same way they bury stores of nuts in the fall so that they will have enough food during the winter.\n\nThis does not guarantee that they will survive, of course. The Great Squirrel Migration followed a year of plenty; even in typical times, most squirrels will die in their first year of life. The mothers know this, and they curl tightly into their babies in their nests for as long as they can. But they can\u2019t stay there forever, because not moving is certain death. So they make their backup plans, and fortify their dreys to the best of their abilities. And they hope for the best.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Prolific stadium builder Bob Dunn, advising the Lightfoot administration on how to fix Soldier Field to keep the Bears in Chicago, released detailed plans Sunday for transforming the isolated stadium into a year-round commercial and entertainment hub, served by a transit station that would underpin his goal of residential expansion on the Near South Side.\n\nDunn estimated that his proposal to dome Soldier Field, working within its existing footprint, would save the Bears at least $1 billion over the cost of building from the ground up in Arlington Heights, where the team has a contract to purchase land.\n\nDunn, president of Landmark Development, said the proposed new Soldier Field and surrounding activity would fatten city tax coffers while giving the Bears and the team\u2019s fans a facility that would be among the tops for NFL teams.\n\nHis credentials include involvement in MetLife Stadium in New Jersey and every stadium for the Bears\u2019 rivals in the NFC North Division.\n\nIn an interview, he offered images that promise that Soldier Field\u2019s design, which has been likened to a crashed spaceship, could become something thrilling.\n\n\u201cHaving built a number of NFL stadiums, having built other sports venues \u2026 having built Lambeau Field, which is consistently ranked as one of the top buildings in all of sports by fans, taking that building and then transforming it to become what it\u2019s become, there is not an opportunity in the sports industry in the United States, I would argue, that matches the opportunity here,\u201d Dunn said.\n\nMayor Lori Lightfoot brought in Dunn last July to help in her effort to keep the Bears in Chicago. He said he\u2019s unpaid for the role, that he has developed the plans at Landmark Development\u2019s expense. He timed the release of his plan to the Bears\u2019 final game of the season.\n\nHe spells out his vision with a website, reimaginesoldierfield.com, that includes a video narrated by former TV news anchor Bill Kurtis.\n\nA rendering showing how Soldier Field\u2019s colonnades could be incorporated into the improvements. Landmark Development\n\nDunn said he hasn\u2019t reviewed the plan with the Bears.\n\nTeam officials have they they are sticking to a contractual obligation and talking only with Arlington Heights officials about what they can build on the former site of Arlington Park racetrack. The Bears have a contract to buy the 326 acres for $197.2 million but could back out of the deal.\n\nThe Lightfoot administration has estimated that a Soldier Field redevelopment, dome and all, could cost $2.2 billion.\n\nDunn\u2019s plan includes a glassy north wall he said could be opened depending on the weather. Stadium capacity could be in the \u201chigh-60s,\u201d he said, compared with the current 61,500 seats.\n\nCity officials promised a feasibility study of public financing options last year but have provided no updates.\n\nFunding would surely be controversial because of the likely hit on taxpayers and the amount still unpaid on debt from Soldier Field\u2019s 2003 renovation. The Illinois Sports Facilities Authority, which handles the debt, said the amount owed is $631.5 million on notes due by 2032.\n\nThe End Zone Club under a proposal for a revamped Soldier Field. Landmark Development\n\nDunn said the city\u2019s $2.2 billion cost estimate was reasonable but that inflation and rising interest rates inevitably would affect the project. He wouldn\u2019t discuss taxpayer funding.\n\nHe predicted that Arlington Heights would cost far more and deliver less for the team and taxpayers.\n\nSoldier Field draws from a central area that gets 50 million visitors a year, with 100 million vehicles a year zipping by on Du Sable Lake Shore Drive.\n\n\u201cThose are Disney-like numbers,\u201d Dunn said.\n\nArlington Heights, he said, might draw eight to 12 million annual visitors.\n\nDunn said the city and the Bears could strike new revenue-sharing deals covering parking, concessions, corporate sponsorships and other income sources.\n\n\u201cYou have to have a different revenue mix,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can be solved. It\u2019s been solved in a lot of markets across the country.\u201d\n\nThe Lightfoot administration responded to questions about Dunn\u2019s plan with a written statement that offered no new details of public funding options.\n\n\u201cMayor Lightfoot has been vocal about the need to reimagine the experience at Soldier Field,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe city still believes that Soldier Field is the best home for the Chicago Bears and continues to . . . explore the future of the stadium.\u201d\n\nWith less than two months before the mayoral election, Dunn\u2019s expanded presentation could be seen as a move to boost Lightfoot\u2019s chances by showcasing her commitment to the lakefront asset. Dunn said his concern is planning, not politics.\n\n\u201cWe have to have a vision here for the future of Soldier Field\u201d whether the Bears move or not, he said. \u201cI think any administration would look at this very favorably.\u201d\n\nScott Hagel, senior vice president of marketing and communications for the Bears, stuck with the tenor of the club\u2019s recent statements about stadium matters, saying, \u201cThe only proposal we are exploring is in Arlington Heights.\u201d\n\nIn Dunn\u2019s outline, Soldier Field would keep its name and its tradition of honoring veterans, with a memorial to armed forces within the building. Its colonnades would stay in place, but the space around them would become active with shops and maybe a food hall.\n\nHis plan calls for a concert stage north of the arena near the Field Museum.\n\nA view of the concert stage that could be Soldier Field\u2019s neighbor. Landmark Development\n\nThe dome would be supported by four columns added near the end zones, prime opportunities for corporate sponsors, Dunn said. Building into what\u2019s now dead space around the stands, he said, would put an end to the current cramped concourses.\n\nThe project could take three to four years to complete, he said.\n\nThe proposal has two main assumptions.\n\nOne is that costs could be held down by using 70% of the existing stadium structure, including the seating bowls, which Dunn said provide an intimate view of games.\n\nThe other assumption is that he can change how fans get to Soldier Field. Most drive now, but Dunn said that, with a transit connection next to the stadium, 40% of the crowd could arrive by rail, comparing the game-day commuting patterns to Wrigley Field.\n\nThe transit hub is a clue to Dunn\u2019s vested interest in helping Soldier Field. It\u2019s a principal part of his plan for a megadevelopment of up to nine highrises built over Metra\u2019s tracks west of the stadium. The plan is called One Central and, as previously sketched out, could cost $20 billion and include more than 9,000 residences.\n\nOne Central needs that transit station \u2014 seen as a junction for the CTA, Metra and Amtrak \u2014 to get people to the future buildings. But its cost is estimated at $6.5 billion. Dunn has promised to fund the construction, provided the state repays him from sales taxes resulting from the development.\n\nCritics have called the public obligation risky. The state has ordered a feasibility study of the transit hub but reserved any decision for giving Dunn a go-ahead.\n\nHe still needs city zoning approval to build One Central, and his original plan has drawn fire from nearby residents and some politicians. Much of the opposition centers on density and access to the site.\n\nDunn said the plan could be downsized.\n\n\u201dI think it\u2019s fair to say we\u2019ve learned a lot, and I think we\u2019ll be able to demonstrate that in what we learned, we made some very significant improvements in the plan.\u201d\n\nDeveloper Bob Dunn discusses how a transit hub can improve access to Soldier Field.

{"text": "Despite a painful year for internet stocks, opportunities in the beaten-up sector are plentiful for investors positioning for a recovery, according to top tech analyst Mark Mahaney. It was a tough year for the sector as valuations tumbled from record highs in an environment defined by rising rates and fears of slowing economic growth. Against this backdrop, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is down more than 31% from its height and about 30% this year, but a comeback may loom on the horizon. While Mahaney viewed the sector cautiously in 2022, the comedown in both estimates and multiples, coupled with cost-cutting initiatives like layoffs, positions many of these names for an \"EPS slingshot opportunity\" when a recovery occurs in 2023 or 2024, he said. \"We would especially highlight stocks going into '23 where we believe: a) revenue models are reasonably recession resilient; b) there are new product cycles; and c) cost actions have already been taken,\" the Evercore ISI analyst wrote. Here are some of Mahaney's favorite internet plays: Netflix shares have suffered one of the more gruesome routs this year, with the stock slumping about 47% as the company shared subscriber losses and battled growing streaming competition . The stock's bounced back from its lows, offering a 76% return since July 1. Big banks like Bank of America and Wells Fargo recently upgraded the stock, viewing upside from Netflix's ad-supported tier. Similarly, Mahaney views the company's cheaper ad-supported tier as a slightly recession-protective offering that can also drive a reacceleration in revenue growth. Heading into the new year, Mahaney also likes Uber , with the firm's price target suggesting shares can nearly triple from Friday's close. Despite suffering a loss in its recent quarter, the ride-sharing giant posted strong forward guidance and a revenue beat as lockdowns ease and consumers return to travel. Shares are down about 37% this year. Mahaney also named Booking Holdings among his top internet picks, highlighting the company's roughly $1.1 trillion total addressable market opportunity and \"asset-light\" business model. Booking shares have tumbled about 16% this year. Mahaney's $2,600 price target suggests shares could gain 29% from Friday's close. During a recent interview with CNBC's \"Closing Bell,\" Mahaney called Booking one of his favorite travel plays heading into the new year , given its solid management team and cautious approach to its cost structure. \"They could arguably grow faster \u2014 post-Covid, post-normalization \u2014 than they were back in 2019,\" he said. \"That's a good story to put together.\" Names like online-dating app Bumble and web software company Wix were also included in Mahaney's top picks list. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting", "label": "human"}

In the two weeks prior to January 4, China reported fewer than 20 deaths from local Covid cases, according to figures released on the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention website.\n\nWHO officials, who have grappled with China\u2019s tight control of data access throughout the pandemic, have become increasingly vocal in their calls for reliable information as a major outbreak rips across China\u2019s urban centers in the wake of an abrupt relaxation of disease controls last month.\n\nThere, the outbreak has overwhelmed hospitals and crematoriums, triggered shortages of basic medicines, and sparked fears of an even darker month ahead as experts warn of a spread to less resourced rural areas during the upcoming Lunar New Year.\n\nThe surge in cases in a country of 1.4 billion has also raised global concerns about the potential emergence of new variants \u2013 and of China\u2019s levels of monitoring and sharing data. A number of economies have implemented Covid testing requirements for travelers from China, citing a dearth of data on strains circulating there.\n\nOn Wednesday, the European Union \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d its member states to introduce a requirement for a negative Covid test for passengers traveling from China to the EU, according to a statement released by the Swedish presidency of the bloc.\n\nThe WHO\u2019s Tedros said Wednesday it was \u201cunderstandable\u201d that some countries were taking these steps, \u201cwith circulation in China so high and comprehensive data not forthcoming.\u201d\n\nChinese health officials presented recent genomic data to a WHO advisory body during a closed-door meeting Tuesday. The variants detected there are known and have been circulating in other countries, with no new variant yet reported by the China CDC, the body said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nBut the group and WHO officials continued to stress the need for more forthcoming genomic data. The latest situation adds to longstanding challenges for the UN body, which faced criticism at the start of the pandemic that it did not push China hard enough for data, amid concerns Beijing was obscuring critical information. Beijing has repeatedly defended its transparency.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more data that needs to be shared from China and additionally from around the world so that we can track this pandemic as we enter this fourth year,\u201d Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO\u2019s technical lead on Covid, said Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe need more information on sequencing around the country, (and for) those sequences to be shared with publicly available databases like GISAID so that deeper analyses can be done,\u201d she said. GISAID is a global initiative that provides access to the genomic data of different influenza viruses.\n\nInformation about China\u2019s outbreak would also be shared with WHO member states during a broader meeting on Thursday, WHO officials said.", "label": "human"}

Of those, 22 were 737 Maxes.\n\nThe Virginia-based manufacturer's commercial aircraft unit had told investors that the flaw would impact its delivery numbers for the month.\n\n\"We'll recover on that quickly,\" Stan Deal, chief executive of Boeing's commercial airplane unit, said during an investor event last week. \"We can surge and we will recover for our deliveries at the end of the year, but that adverse quality which we have to manage out of the system was an impact.\"\n\nBoeing is making about 31 of the 737s a month. Last week, it told investors that it expects to deliver between 400 and 450 of its 737s next year, up from about 375 planes this year.\n\nThe company logged orders for 122 of its 737 Max planes in October from carriers including Alaska Airlines and British Airways' parent International Consolidated Airlines Group.\n\nSupply chain problems and labor shortages have prevented the manufacturer from ramping production up further, an issue that has hit rival Airbus, too, just as travelers are returning in droves. JetBlue and United are among the airlines that have complained about aircraft delivery delays.\n\nBoeing last week laid out a recovery plan for investors and analysts that forecast a return to annual sales of around $100 billion by the middle of this decade.

{"text": "The recent announcement by the State Administration Council of Myanmar has granted a general amnesty to over 7,000 prisoners, a move seen as an effort to ease tensions in the country following the February 1 coup. This amnesty covers those convicted of minor offenses and those jailed for political activities, including members of pro-democracy political parties. The news has been welcomed by civil society groups, who have been calling for the release of all political prisoners since the military took control of the government. However, Amnesty International has warned that the amnesty does not address the root causes of the crisis and urged the junta to release all political prisoners. The announcement has also raised concerns about the fate of those already released under a previous amnesty and those released on bail. The Myanmar junta has not released any information on the total number of political prisoners in the country, with estimates ranging from over 2,000 to over 5,000. The international community has condemned the coup and imposed sanctions on Myanmar, while the United Nations has launched an investigation into human rights violations. The situation in Myanmar has been further complicated by the postponement of general elections, which the military has said will be held when the country is \"stabilized\" and \"inclusive dialogue and national reconciliation is achieved.\" The international community is pressing for a return to democracy and the release of all political prisoners, with the United Nations Secretary-General warning of \"severe consequences\" if the junta fails to comply with these demands.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "In the face of rising global temperatures, Cambodian farmers are grappling with the consequences of climate change on their livelihoods. Unpredictable weather patterns, dwindling water resources, and increased pest and disease pressure have taken a toll on the country's agricultural sector.\n\nFor farmers in Cambodia, the situation is precarious. Many are struggling to make ends meet due to poor crop yields and high input costs. With mounting debts, some are resorting to desperate measures to stay afloat.\n\nOne coping mechanism is the use of microfinance loans. In Cambodia, microfinance is the primary source of credit for individuals without access to traditional banking services. These loans can be a lifeline for farmers, enabling them to purchase essential agricultural inputs like seeds, tools, and pesticides.\n\nCambodia has become synonymous with microfinance, with over 100 active microfinance institutions operating in the country. However, these loans come with significant risks, as they often feature exorbitant interest rates. If farmers are unable to repay the loan, they may find themselves in an even more precarious financial situation.\n\nUnfortunately, this is the reality facing many Cambodian farmers. Despite their best efforts, many are unable to repay their loans, putting their livelihoods at risk.\n\nAs the effects of climate change continue to impact the agricultural sector, the situation is likely to deteriorate unless immediate action is taken. The government is providing assistance to struggling farmers, including loan subsidies and infrastructure development.\n\nHowever, to truly support Cambodia's farmers and build resilience to climate change, more needs to be done. Access to credit must be made more affordable and accessible for farmers, enabling them to secure the resources they need to protect their crops and futures.\n\nThe challenge of helping Cambodia's farmers is significant, but it is clear that greater investment in microfinance and other forms of support will be essential for building a sustainable future.", "label": "machine"}

It handed hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts to America's wealthiest people and corporations under the flimsy premise that these economic benefits would somehow translate to economic benefits for everyone else.\n\nIt didn't work, of course. Trickle-down economics never works. The $4,000 annual raise that former speaker of the House Paul Ryan promised American households would see in the form of higher wages never materialized. The Trump tax cuts didn't increase investments in American business \u2014 in fact, the wealth created for the richest Americans from those tax cuts likely wound up overseas.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin promised that the tax plan would \"pay for itself\" with economic growth, but that economic growth never materialized. Instead, the Congressional Budget Office found that corporate tax revenue fell by over 30% the year after the tax cuts passed.\n\nWe're still unraveling all the harm that the 2017 Trump tax bill has done to the economy. In his new book, \"Only the Rich Can Play: How Washington Works in the New Gilded Age,\" David Wessel, a Brookings economist and director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy, documents a clever tax-cut mechanism written into the law that escaped attention until recently.\n\nIn the latest episode of the \"Pitchfork Economics\" podcast, Wessel explains how so-called \"opportunity zones\" were created in the bill as a way to develop the economy in nearly 9,000 targeted areas around the country \u2014 but they really only served as a capital-gains tax cut for the super-rich.\n\nThe plan was relatively simple: Poor and underdeveloped locations around the country that could benefit from a massive influx of cash were identified as opportunity zones, and wealthy people and corporations could claim their investments in opportunity zones as a tax cut. The policy was slipped into the tax bill without much fanfare, and requirements for federal watchdogs to study and report on economic results of the opportunity zones plan were stripped from the bill before it passed.\n\n\"Once governors designated opportunity zones from a list of census tracts that the law made eligible, almost any investment in a property or business in a zone qualified,\" Wessel wrote in the New York Times, adding that \"one doesn't need to even assert that an investment will help the people who live in the zone.\"\n\nThanks to a recent investigation into 2019 tax records, a pair of enterprising economists provided a partial view of how nearly $19 billion in investments into opportunity zones worked out. The authors of the report, Patrick Kennedy and Harrison Wheeler, found that wealthy Americans and corporations only invested in about 16% of the existing opportunity zones. The majority of zones that received any funds were \"neighborhoods with pre-existing upward trends in population, income, and home values, and declining shares of elderly and nonwhite residents,\" Wheeler and Kennedy said.\n\nWessel said that recipients of opportunity-zone funds include \"a Ritz-Carlton hotel and condo complex in downtown Portland, Oregon, and a Virgin Hotel in New Orleans. Self-storage facilities, which create hardly any jobs, are sprouting with opportunity zone money. So is luxury student housing in university towns, which are eligible only because college kids show up as poor in census tallies.\"\n\nIn other words, the opportunity-zone program used the excuse of investing in thousands of low-income communities around the country, many of which happen to be nonwhite communities that have been ignored by politicians and business leaders for generations, to create a huge flow of untaxed money into a handful of mostly white, wealthy communities.\n\nIt's a damning reminder that even when trickle-down economics is explicitly written into the tax code as a feature and not a bug, the only people who benefit are the wealthy few, at the expense of everyone else.\n\nThe Trump tax cuts could serve as a watershed moment for trickle-down precisely because they prove the fallacy at the heart of the idea that rich people are the true job creators.\n\nFor the first time in 40 years, mainstream politicians are talking seriously about investing broadly in the American people through programs like affordable childcare, paid family leave, and worker-friendly laws like increased overtime thresholds and higher minimum wages.\n\nIf they follow through on their promises, they could finally upturn trickle-down's hold on the economy by proving that it's the consumer spending of working Americans \u2014 and not ridiculous, convoluted, free-market opportunity-zone schemes \u2014 that creates jobs and grows the economy from the middle out.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "If you live in Seattle, the prospect of a solar-powered electric car may not be that exciting, but enough people in sunnier places want to try the futuristic vehicle that automaker Lightyear has announced its second model. The Lightyear 2 is expected to enter production at the end of 2025 and go on sale with a starting price below $40,000.\n\nAccording to the company, the Lightyear 2 will halve the lifetime vehicle CO2 emissions compared to a traditional EV. The vehicle also promises 500 miles of range between charges, and the company says it has received 21,000 preorders from car-leasing and ride-sharing companies. Though the amount of solar-powered range was not shared specifically, the car will add several miles each day from its solar panels, the amount determined by the level of available sunlight.\n\nLightyear shared few other details, other than that the car will offer an impressive 0.175 drag coefficient, which will make it one of the slipperier cars around. The company did say its 500-mile estimate is based on how much sun would contribute to range during 15,000 miles of driving per year in Chicago.\n\nThe crossover-like 2 follows the insanely futuristic-looking Lightyear 0. That car features a range of 388 miles, and the company says its solar panels can add more than 6,800 miles per year. It also costs more than $263,000, so it\u2019s far from becoming a mainstream hit.\n\nLightyear announced that hopeful buyers could enter their information to get on the waitlist for the car, but a spokesperson told Autoblog that the waitlist is more of an email list to distribute information. Signing up gives priority when preorders and reservations do open, though, so it's probably best to sign up if you're at all interested.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t been paying close attention, it might seem like solar-powered EVs are coming out of nowhere, but there are at least a couple of other companies in the mix. The Sono Sion is a $25,000 solar EV that should begin production in Europe later this year. It offers a range of 190 miles and provides 5,700 miles of solar charging per year, or around 15 miles per day.\n\nStory continues\n\nAptera took a completely different approach than Lightyear and Sono, building a three-wheeled solar EV that looks like an airplane missing its wings. The funky car features up to a 1,000-mile range in the top model and can add up to 30 miles of range in a sunny location.\n\nSolar-powered EVs, like solar-powered homes, are somewhat at the mercy of the weather. The bulk of their range is gained like any other EV, through plugging in, but solar charging contributes. Most of the range numbers seen here are taken in sunny locations, such as Aptera\u2019s, which quotes Southern California as the region. Those of us living in less fantastic climates will see less of an impact from the solar panels, but any ability to charge for free should be welcomed.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The world is poised on the cusp of a pivotal year, with various political trends converging to shape the global landscape. The ongoing rivalry between the United States and China is expected to intensify, with both nations vying for economic and military supremacy. The Biden administration's stance on China remains unchanged, advocating for a balanced approach of cooperation and competition.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia's pivot towards the West may lead to a thaw in relations between Moscow and the West. A potential meeting between Putin and Biden could address key issues such as nuclear arms control, Ukraine, and the Arctic region, potentially reducing tensions and opening up avenues for cooperation.\n\nPopulism is likely to continue its upward trajectory, with populist parties making gains across Europe and potentially influencing the outcome of elections in countries like France and the UK. The rise of populism may also lead to increased scrutiny of immigration and the refugee crisis.\n\nClimate change remains a pressing concern, with the Biden administration committed to reducing emissions and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Other countries are expected to follow suit, setting ambitious targets for carbon neutrality and promoting renewable energy sources.\n\nLastly, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic will continue to be a major factor in global politics, with many countries focusing on rebuilding their economies while addressing the challenges posed by the virus. The year ahead promises to be eventful, with the world working to address the challenges of the present and plan for a sustainable future.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The upcoming week will witness a significant milestone in the world of finance, as major stock indexes are poised to reach new heights. The optimism stems from the economy's steady growth and the containment of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States.\n\nBefore the market opens on Tuesday, here are five key factors to keep an eye on:\n\n1. Market predictions indicate a positive start to the week. \n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq 100 futures are all trending upwards in pre-market trading. The Dow futures are expected to rise by 105 points, or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures are expected to gain 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively.\n\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite closed at record levels on Monday, with the Dow only 0.4% away from its all-time high. The three indexes have collectively risen in the first three days of the new year.\n\n2. Earnings season is in full swing.\n\nThis week marks the busiest period of the latest earnings season, with over 1,100 companies set to release their quarterly financial results. Analysts predict that S&P 500 companies will report a year-over-year decline of just 6.7% in fourth-quarter earnings.\n\nThe focus will be on companies' outlooks and projections for the upcoming year, as investors seek clarity on the economy's recovery. Tuesday's earnings calendar is packed with financials, industrials, technology, and more.\n\n3. Congress passes a new relief package.\n\nThe U.S. Senate unanimously approved a $900 billion relief package on Monday, which includes direct payments to most Americans, funds for small businesses, an extension of unemployment benefits, and an extension of the eviction moratorium.\n\nThe House is expected to pass the bill and send it to President Donald Trump for his signature later on Tuesday.\n\n4. Optimism about stimulus is on the rise.\n\nThe news of the relief package sent optimism about the economic outlook soaring. The 10-year Treasury yield hit its highest level since March on Tuesday, as investors bet on economic strength going into the new year.\n\n5. Global markets are on the rise.\n\nThe global markets will start the new year on a positive note, as equity indexes in Europe and Asia also edged higher on Tuesday. China's CSI 300 index rose 0.6%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 closed 0.8% higher. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index was up 0.6%.\n\nIn the commodities space, oil prices inched up on Tuesday, with the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate adding 0.5% to $48.86 per barrel. International benchmark Brent rose 0.3% to $51.66 per barrel. \n\nGold prices remained steady, with spot gold trading flat at $1,960.10 per ounce.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Het is nu officieel 2023, en er zijn nieuwe vermogensbelastingregels in werking getreden. In dit artikel bespreken we de nieuwe methode en wat het betekent voor uw financi\u00eble situatie.\n\nEr zijn twee tarieven voor de vermogensbelasting: 15% voor vermogen tot \u20ac500.000 en 35% voor vermogen boven \u20ac500.000. Deze tarieven gelden voor alle belastingplichtigen, zowel particulieren als ondernemingen.\n\nEr is ook een vrijstelling van \u20ac10.000 voor het eerste \u20ac100.000 van uw vermogen. Als uw vermogen hoger is dan \u20ac100.000, wordt de vrijstelling toegepast op alle extra vermogen.\n\nVoor een enkelpersoonshuishouden betekent dit dat als je vermogen meer is dan \u20ac100.000, je 15% vermogensbelasting betaalt over het bruto-vermogen tot \u20ac500.000 en 35% over het bruto-vermogen dat boven \u20ac500.000 ligt.\n\nHet is belangrijk om te onthouden dat alleen het \"netto\" vermogen wordt belast, wat betekent dat u uw vermogen moet berekenen zonder schulden.\n\nOm het voor belastingbetalers gemakkelijker te maken, heeft de Nederlandse belastingdienst een rekentool gelanceerd. Hiermee kunnen zij hun bruto-vermogen invoeren en de belastingdienst rekent uit hoeveel vermogensbelasting ze moeten betalen.\n\nHoewel er een vrijstelling is voor het eerste \u20ac100.000 van uw vermogen, betekent dit niet dat iedereen van de vermogensbelasting vrijgesteld is. Er zijn nog steeds een aantal situaties waarin de vermogensbelasting geheven kan worden.\n\nOok is het belangrijk om te onthouden dat de vermogensbelasting niet alleen geldt voor personen die in Nederland belastingplichtig zijn. Voor buitenlandse belastingplichtigen gelden dezelfde regels.\n\nTot slot is het belangrijk om te weten dat de vermogensbelasting een jaarlijks terugkerend belastingvoordeel is. Als u de vermogensbelasting in het eerste kwartaal van het jaar betaalt, dan krijgt u een teruggave als uw vermogen over het hele jaar niet meer is dan \u20ac100.000.\n\nHet is belangrijk om de tijd te nemen om te begrijpen hoe de nieuwe methode precies werkt.

{"text": "The huge omnibus spending bill that was unveiled Tuesday contains an important series of provisions to help Americans save more. Buried in the 4,100 page bill is the \"Secure 2.0\" plan which would, among other things, require employers to automatically enroll employees in their 401(k) plan at a rate of least 3% but not more than 10% of their salary. Businesses with 10 or fewer employees or in business less than three years would be excluded. Doesn't sound like much, but it's a potentially important leap in helping overcome the retirement crisis. You can thank a University of Chicago professor, Richard Thaler, for helping popularize the idea. Thaler is one of the founding fathers of behavioral economics, which studies how people really behave, not how they are supposed to behave. One of those insights is that humans tend not to take action when they should: there is a lot of \"inertia\" in human decisions. Thaler designed many \"nudges\" that helped spur people to do things beneficial to them. Like saving more money for retirement. Thaler's 'nudge' Employer-sponsored 401(k) plans have been around since the late 1970s, but a lot of workers don't sign up for them, even when employers offer matching contributions. Not signing up made little sense, except if you understood that humans often don't act in their own self-interest. Thaler's \"nudge,\" which he suggested some 20 years ago, was automatic enrollment: employees are automatically enrolled in the program, unless they opt out. Congress built on that suggestion: the Pension Protection Act of 2006 encouraged employers to adopt automatic enrollment plans. It caught on, and many companies adopted the idea. Enrollment went way up. Today, about 6 in 10 employers offer automatic enrollment. A 2021 Vanguard study found that 91% of new hires stay in the plan when enrollment is automatic, compared with 28% at firms where contributions are voluntary. They also tend to increase contributions over time. The Secure 2.0 bill further codifies that practice into law. Americans don't save enough for retirement Remember the old \"three legged stool\" for retirement: personal savings, a pension and Social Security. That's mostly gone. Few young Americans have pensions. The average Social Security is check is $1,400 a month, not enough to get by for most people. That leaves personal savings. We need more \"nudges\" to get people to save more. The Secure 2.0 provisions would also create bigger \"catch-up\" contributions for older workers, allowing workers to put away an extra $10,000 a year once they are over 50 (the current limit is $6,500). It would also increase the age when Required Minimum Distributions would start, first to 73 from the current 72, and then 75 in 2033. Thank you, Richard Thaler Thaler won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2017 for his contributions to understanding human behavior. He has spent a lifetime studying irrational behavior, but when he won the Nobel Prize he joked that he intended to spend the prize money \"as irrationally as possible.\" There's a man who not only understands people, he understands himself.", "label": "human"}

More Information The information related to the JetBlue Plus Card has been collected by Business Insider and has not been reviewed by the issuer.\n\n40,000 bonus points after spending $1,000 on purchases and paying the annual fee in full within the first 90 days from account opening\n\n6X points on eligible JetBlue purchases\n\n2X points at restaurants and grocery stores\n\n1X points on all other purchases\n\n5,000 bonus points every year after your account anniversary\n\nMosaic benefits after spending $50,000 or more on purchases each calendar year with your card\n\nAnnual $100 statement credit after purchasing a JetBlue Vacations package of $100 or more with your JetBlue Plus Card\n\n50% inflight savings on cocktails and food purchases\n\nFree first checked bag for you and up to 3 companions on the same reservation when you use your JetBlue Plus Card to purchase tickets\n\nNo foreign transaction fees\n\nThe Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae is currently offering 60,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening.\n\nCardholders earn 5x total Chase Ultimate Rewards points on air travel and 10x total points on hotels and car rentals purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards\u00ae (after earning the $300 travel credit) and 3x points on other travel and dining. You can use the points to book travel directly through Chase, or transfer them to airline and hotel partners like United, Southwest, JetBlue, and Hyatt.\n\nChase's definition of \"travel\" is broad. You'll earn 3x points per dollar spent (outside of Chase Ultimate Rewards\u00ae) on flights, hotels, tolls, parking garages, taxis, and rideshare services like Uber and Lyft. Plus, you'll earn 3x points on dining, including takeout and delivery. These are all popular spending categories for New Yorkers.\n\nCardholders can also activate two years of complimentary Lyft Pink All Access membership (usually $199 per year), plus get 50% off their third year of membership.\n\nThe Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae has an annual fee of $550, but you'll get up to $300 in annual travel credits that apply to most travel purchases, including rideshares, which offsets over half the fee.\n\nYou'll get other valuable benefits like primary car rental insurance and trip delay and cancellation insurance. I had this card when I lived in New York and found it worth keeping for the lucrative points earning alone.\n\nIn New York City, you'll likely find yourself on the MTA subway or a commuter train like Amtrak or NJ Transit at some point, if not daily. You can earn 3x Chase Ultimate Rewards points on every dollar spent on tickets with the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae card, because train rides are included within Chase's broad travel category.\n\nEven better, you can use the up to $300 annual travel credits from the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae toward a subway or commuter train pass or tickets, which helps to offset the card's annual fee. Plus, you'll earn bonus points for most other travel and for dining. It's a handy card to have when you purchase train tickets to move about the city.\n\nIf you're not sure you can make the most of the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae card's benefits, consider the Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card, with a $95 annual fee. It earns 2x Chase Ultimate Rewards points on travel (outside of purchases made through Chase Ultimate Rewards) and 3x points on dining. Either card is ideal to use in New York City.\n\nNew Yorkers like stopping into Duane Reade or other drugstores for quick essentials. With a drugstore around nearly every corner, it's convenient to pop in any time as most of them are open around the clock.\n\nThe Chase Freedom Flex\u2120 offers a $200 after spending $500 on purchases in the first three months from account opening, and earns 3% cash back on drugstore purchases with no cap, which can add up quickly if you spend a lot at drugstores. You'll also earn 3% cash back on dining at restaurants, including takeout and eligible food delivery services, 5% cash back in rotating quarterly bonus categories (up to $1,500 in combined purchases each quarter when you activate, then 1%) and travel booked through Chase, and 1% cash back on most purchases. That's strong earning potential for a card with no annual fee.\n\nThe cash back is actually earned in the form of Chase Ultimate Rewards points. With the Chase Freedom Flex\u2120, 1 point is worth 1 cent, but your points are potentially worth much more if you pair the Chase Freedom Flex\u2120 with another Chase Ultimate Rewards card, like the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae, Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card, or Ink Business Preferred\u00ae Credit Card.\n\nChase Ultimate Rewards points are worth 1.8 cents apiece, on average, based on Insider's points and miles valuations, but the return you'll get depends on the cards you have and how you redeem your points.\n\nNew York City's restaurant scene needs no introduction, and is enjoyed by residents and visitors alike. In fact, many New Yorkers eat out or get delivery more often than not, especially because there are dozens of unique restaurants in each neighborhood.\n\nThe American Express\u00ae Gold Card comes with a welcome bonus offer of 60,000 points after you spend at least $4,000 in your first 6 months of card membership. It's the best card to use for dining out, takeout, and food delivery in New York City because you'll earn 4 American Express Membership Rewards points per dollar spent. Plus, you'll get up to $120 in dining credits each year** that are easy for New Yorkers to use.\n\nAfter enrollment, you can use up to $10 in statement credits each month for purchases at Grubhub, Seamless, The Cheesecake Factory, Milk Bar, Goldbelly, Wine.com, and participating Shake Shack locations. Even if you don't like the restaurants on the list, most New Yorkers can make good use of Grubhub and Seamless delivery once per month when they're not dining at their favorite local restaurants. This helps to cover the card's $250 annual fee.\n\nIf city exploration is your favorite thing to do, consider the Capital One Savor Cash Rewards Credit Card and its solid intro bonus: Earn a one-time $300 cash bonus once you spend $3,000 on purchases within the first 3 months. It earns 4% cash back on entertainment purchases \u2014 a broad category that includes things like tickets to movie theaters, plays, sporting events, and concerts, as well as tourist attractions, dance clubs, and many other activities.\n\nPlus, the card now offers cardholders 10% cash back on Uber and Uber Eats purchases, and a complimentary Uber One membership (offer ends November 14, 2024).\n\nThere aren't a lot of cards that reward entertainment purchases. You'll also earn 4% cash back on dining, 2% cash back at grocery stores, and 1% cash back on all other purchases. The Capital One Savor Cash Rewards Credit Card comes with a $95 annual fee, but if you spend a lot in the bonus categories, you can easily cover it. Run the numbers and see if your entertainment spending is enough to make this card worthwhile.\n\nDelta is a good airline for New Yorkers because they have a domestic hub at LaGuardia and many international flights out of JFK. Amex offers several Delta credit cards, but most casual flyers will do well with the Delta SkyMiles\u00ae Gold American Express Card. Right now, the card is offering a welcome bonus of 40,000 bonus miles after you spend $2,000 in purchases on your new card in your first six months.\n\nWith it, you'll get a free first checked bag on Delta flights for yourself and up to eight companions traveling on the same reservation, Zone 1 Priority boarding, and a 20% discount on inflight purchases as a statement credit. Considering it costs $30 to check a bag each way, you can recover the card's annual fee of $0 intro for the first year, then $99, in a single trip traveling with friends or family.\n\nThe Delta SkyMiles\u00ae Gold American Express Card also earns 2x Delta miles on Delta purchases, at restaurants worldwide (including takeout and delivery in the U.S.), and at U.S. supermarkets, which are bonus categories most New Yorkers can appreciate.\n\nIf you prefer to fly out of Newark, chances are you'll find yourself on a United flight. In that case, the United\u2120 Explorer Card is the best credit card for United flyers, with a limited-time elevated welcome bonus offer of 60,000 bonus miles after you spend $3,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening.\n\nYou'll earn 2x miles on United purchases, dining (including eligible delivery services), and hotel stays. Cardholders also get a statement credit of up to $100 for Global Entry, TSA PreCheck, or NEXUS every four years.\n\nThe card also mimics lower-level elite status by providing a free first checked bag for you and one companion on the same reservation when you pay for your ticket with the card, priority boarding, 25% back as a statement credit for United inflight purchases, and two United Club passes each cardmember anniversary.\n\nAll combined, the card is easily worth its annual fee of $0 intro for the first year, then $95, especially if you make the most of its generous perks. It's also one of the rare cards that offer primary car rental insurance.\n\nFrequent United flyers should also consider the United Club\u2120 Infinite Card, which comes with United Club airport lounge membership, additional benefits, and a new limited-time bonus.\n\nAmerican Airlines offers plenty of flights out of their hubs at LaGuardia domestically and JFK for trans-Atlantic travel. With the Citi\u00ae / AAdvantage\u00ae Platinum Select\u00ae World Elite Mastercard\u00ae, you'll earn 2x miles per dollar spent on eligible American Airlines purchases, and at restaurants and gas stations.\n\nAlong with a welcome bonus offer of 50,000 American Airlines AAdvantage\u00ae bonus miles after spending $2,500 in purchases within the first 3 months of account opening, the card also gets you a free first checked bag on domestic American Airlines flights, as well as for up to four companions traveling on the same itinerary. That perk alone can cover the card's annual fee of $99, waived for first 12 months. You'll also get preferred boarding when you fly on American Airlines and a 25% discount on inflight food and beverage purchases. If you fly American Airlines a few times per year, this is the best credit card for American Airlines flights.\n\nFinally, there's New York's hometown airline, JetBlue, which occupies all of Terminal 5 at JFK airport. New Yorkers love flying JetBlue for its comfort, unlimited snacks, and welcoming atmosphere.

{"text": "The Enigmatic Case of Tesla's Stock Price\n\nThe stock market's fascination with Tesla (TSLA) has been a subject of debate among investors. While some are captivated by the company's innovative spirit and cutting-edge products, others remain skeptical about its ability to turn a profit. The dichotomy, coupled with the inherent risks associated with tech stocks and Tesla's declining stock price, has left many investors perplexed. However, according to Wharton professor and renowned finance expert, Jeremy Siegel, there is a clear explanation for the selloff that puts it in a familiar context.\n\nIn a recent blog post, Siegel posited that Tesla's stock price decline can be attributed to investor expectations that have outpaced reality, a phenomenon reminiscent of Warren Buffett's investments in the 1990s.\n\n\"During the 1990s, Warren Buffett invested heavily in various US companies,\" Siegel wrote. \"However, he faced immense expectations for those investments. The shares of the companies he bought surged, but not nearly to the level that the market had priced in his expectations. A similar scenario is unfolding with Tesla today.\"\n\nSiegel argues that investors have flocked to the stock, expecting it to become one of the most influential and valuable companies in the world. Unfortunately, he believes this is unrealistic without significant advancements in the car maker's production capabilities and technology. Without these breakthroughs, Tesla will struggle to meet investors' expectations, and the stock will struggle to maintain its current price.\n\n\"Without the prospect of Tesla becoming the Amazon, Microsoft, or Apple of the automotive world, it is challenging to envision the stock sustaining its current valuation levels,\" Siegel wrote.\n\nThis is not to say that Tesla is a poor investment; rather, investors should temper their expectations and acknowledge that the company's future prospects are more limited than its lofty valuations suggest.\n\nSiegel's take on Tesla's stock price decline is echoed by several Wall Street analysts. Many believe that the stock's high valuation reflects irrational exuberance rather than its business prospects. Indeed, in the past year, several well-known analysts, including Bank of America, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs, have downgraded their ratings on the company.\n\nUltimately, it appears that Tesla is a high-risk, high-reward stock. If the company can deliver on its ambitious plans, the stock could reach new heights. However, there is a very real risk that the company may fail to meet investor expectations, resulting in a prolonged period of disappointing returns. As Siegel has emphasized, it's essential to be mindful of these risks when investing in Tesla stock.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "In the heart of Asheville, North Carolina, a small, vibrant community has blossomed, offering a fresh start to those seeking a more fulfilling life. For Jaquay Boone, a 28-year-old writer and artist, this community, known as Fireseed Haven, was a lifeline when she was drowning in debt and struggling with mental health.\n\nPrior to moving into the tiny home village, Boone had accumulated significant debt while pursuing her education. The weight of this financial burden was taking a toll on her mental well-being. However, her decision to join Fireseed Haven marked a turning point. The community's emphasis on sustainability, shared values, and a strong sense of connection allowed Boone to regain control of her finances and ultimately pay off her debt.\n\nThe tiny home village, comprising 19 homes ranging from 200 to 500 square feet, is nestled amidst a communal garden and features a shared kitchen, pottery studio, and library. Boone's home, like the others, is a cozy haven that has enabled her to focus on her creative pursuits. By saving money on rent and utilities, she has been able to dedicate herself to her writing and art.\n\nBeyond the financial benefits, Boone has found a sense of belonging and family among the community's residents, who share her passion for sustainability and creativity. The village has grown since Boone's arrival, and she now serves as a mentor to newcomers, guiding them through the unique lifestyle and principles of Fireseed Haven.\n\nBoone's experience has been transformative, and she is deeply grateful for the community she has found. \"Living in the tiny home village has been a huge blessing,\" she says. \"I'm so grateful for the family I've found here and for the chance to focus on my passions without being weighed down by debt.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The United States Congress established an independent, bipartisan January 6th Commission to investigate the violent event that occurred on January 6th at the US Capitol. On Tuesday, the commission released its comprehensive report, which details the events of that day and the role former President Donald Trump played in it.\n\nHere are fourteen key findings from the commission's report:\n\n1. The rioters' intentions were to disrupt the certification of the electoral votes: The commission found that the rioters aimed to interfere with the Congressional proceedings, particularly the certification of Joe Biden's electoral votes.\n\n2. Trump's speech played a significant role in radicalizing the crowd: The commission concluded that Trump's speech to the crowd on January 6th was a crucial factor in motivating the crowd to take action and engage in violence.\n\n3. Trump issued a \"stand down\" order during the attack: The report found that Trump instructed his supporters to \"stand down\" and \"go home\" instead of taking further action to prevent the certification of the votes.\n\n4. Trump failed to utilize all available resources to protect the Capitol: The commission found that despite having access to all available resources, Trump chose not to mobilize the National Guard or issue an executive order to protect the Capitol.\n\n5. The rioters were well-armed, organized, and planned their attack in advance: The commission found that the rioters were highly organized, well-armed, and had planned their attack in advance, bringing weapons, creating maps of the Capitol, and coordinating through online message boards.\n\n6. There was a coordinated effort to identify and target individual members of Congress: The commission found that the rioters had created a list of targeted members of Congress, identified them by name, and had a map of the Capitol to find specific offices.\n\n7. Police had received warnings about potential violence before the attack: The commission found that Capitol Police had received warnings from both internal and external sources about the potential for violence on January 6th, but did not take necessary measures to prepare for the attack.\n\n8. The Capitol was left vulnerable due to poor security and planning: The commission found that the Capitol was left open and vulnerable on the day of the attack due to inadequate security measures and poor planning by the Capitol Police.\n\n9. The extent of the destruction inside the Capitol was more severe than initially reported: The commission found that the rioters caused significant destruction inside the Capitol that far exceeded what was initially reported, destroying paintings, historical artifacts, and vandalizing offices.\n\n10. Rioters entered the Capitol using various methods: The commission found that the rioters entered the Capitol using methods such as scaling the outer walls and fences, forcing open windows and doors, and pushing through a crowd at the front door.\n\n11. The National Guard was not deployed until hours after the attack began: The commission found that the National Guard was not deployed until hours after the attack began, and even then, the response was insufficient to contain the rioters.\n\n12. The attack was more violent than originally reported: The commission found that the attack was significantly more violent than initially reported, with rioters assaulting officers, throwing objects, and using force to break into the Capitol.\n\n13. Intelligence agencies failed to adequately warn Congress of the danger: The commission found that the intelligence agencies failed to adequately warn Congress of the danger they were in, despite having prior knowledge of the potential for violence.\n\n14. Trump was slower to respond than other members of the government: The commission found that Trump was slower than other members of the government in responding to the attack, eventually releasing a statement calling for \"peace and lawfulness\" several hours after the attack began.\n\nThe report concluded that the attack was preventable and that the government, including the President, failed to act. The report also noted that \"this was not a protest gone wrong. This was an intentional attack on our government and the rule of law.\"", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "A peculiar phenomenon has been observed in certain individuals, typically young women, where they exhibit an excessive drive to compensate for perceived shortcomings and disadvantages. This inclination often leads to feelings of being overwhelmed and, in some cases, exhaustion. The term \"lucky girl syndrome\" was coined in 2012 by medical experts and has since been a topic of discussion in the medical and psychological communities.\n\nThis syndrome is not merely a notion but a genuine mental disorder that can have severe psychological consequences, including a lack of self-worth and a negative outlook on life. It is often rooted in low self-esteem and an internal sense of inadequacy. Those afflicted may feel compelled to work twice as hard as others to achieve their goals, placing immense pressure on themselves to \"succeed.\"\n\nThe symptoms of this phenomenon vary among individuals but typically include excessive stress and guilt, overthinking, lack of self-confidence, and procrastination. Those affected tend to be perfectionists, comparing their performance to others in an unrealistic and unfair manner. They may also feel inadequate, which can lead to depression and anxiety.\n\nIt is essential to recognize the signs of this syndrome to address and treat it before it develops into a more serious issue. Common signs include low self-esteem, feeling overwhelmed and exhausted, and an excessive need for approval. Additionally, look out for irrational fears and a need to control situations. If you notice these signs in yourself or someone else, it is crucial to consult a doctor or mental health professional.\n\nManaging this syndrome involves practicing self-care, including getting adequate rest, maintaining a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and taking time to relax. It is also essential to identify and address the underlying cause of the syndrome. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can be particularly effective in helping individuals develop coping strategies and build self-confidence.\n\nThis syndrome can be debilitating, but with the right assistance and support, it is possible to manage it. If you suspect you or someone you know may be experiencing this phenomenon, seek help from a medical or mental health professional. With proper treatment and support, it is possible to overcome the disorder and live a happy and fulfilling life.", "label": "machine"}

REUTERS/Alexander Ermochenko\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMAKIIVKA, Ukraine, Jan 3 (Reuters) - A Ukrainian missile strike on Jan. 1 against a vocational school in the Russian-controlled Donetsk region of Ukraine housing mobilised Russian troops has become one of the bloodiest incidents of Russia's nearly year-long war in Ukraine.\n\nWhat do we know, and what do we not know, about what happened?\n\nWHAT HAPPENED\n\nThe strike on Professional Technical School No. 19 in Makiivka, a twin city to the regional capital of Donetsk which has been controlled by Russian proxy forces since 2014, occurred at 0001 on New Year's Day, Daniil Bezsonov, a Russian-installed Donetsk official, said.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said Ukraine struck with six U.S.-made HIMARS rockets.\n\nThe governor of Russia's Samara region said that many of the dead soldiers were locals.\n\nUnconfirmed footage circulated on social media purportedly shows residents watching Russian President Vladimir Putin's midnight address before running for cover as missiles strike the ground nearby.\n\nReuters photographs from the scene show the ruined remains of the school.\n\nLOSSES\n\nReports of casualties vary. Reuters was unable to independently verify how many people were killed.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said on Monday that 63 soldiers had been killed in the strike, an assessment echoed by a source close to Donetsk's Russia-installed separatist leadership, who told Reuters that dozens had died.\n\nThe ministry acknowledged the attack only in the final paragraph of a 528-word daily roundup, more than 36 hours after the attack took place.\n\nRussia has consistently underplayed its casualty figures, including claiming that only one man died during the sinking of the battleship Moskva in April.\n\nUkraine has claimed a far higher casualty figure, saying that around 400 died. A number of Russian military bloggers, who have gained large followings through mixing pro-Kremlin advocacy with unvarnished information on the state of the front, have also given casualty figures closer to the Ukrainian number.\n\nIn a post on the Telegram messaging app, Igor Girkin, a former FSB officer instrumental in starting the initial 2014 war in the Donbas, said that there were \"many hundreds\" of killed and injured.\n\nGirkin said that ammunition and military equipment had been stored in the buildings, contributing to the strength of the blast. He blamed Russia's \"untrainable\" generals for the losses.\n\nGrey Zone, a Telegram channel linked to the Wagner mercenary outfit, said that around 500 men were billeted in the complex.\n\nIn footage circulated on social media and geolocated by Reuters, the vocational school, a large complex of Soviet-era buildings, appears virtually razed as emergency service workers sift through rubble.\n\nOUTCRY\n\nComing at the climax of the new year's celebrations, the most important holiday of the year in Russia, the attack has resonated within Russia.\n\nA report by state-owned news agency TASS, citing Donetsk officials, saying that Ukrainian forces were able to identify the target from soldiers using their Russian mobile phones has provoked anger among Russia's military blogger community.\n\n\"As expected, the blame for what happened in Makiivka began to be blamed on the mobilised soldiers themselves.

These price cuts will only apply to vehicles produced at its new plant near Shanghai and sold in China.\n\nThis move comes just two weeks after the company announced the start of production of the Model 3 at its first plant in China, which analysts believe will help Tesla increase its market share in the country.\n\nTesla has faced stiff competition in China, which has seen a surge in both domestic and foreign electric vehicle manufacturers. To gain an edge over rivals, Tesla reduced prices of its Model S in October, aiming to attract Chinese consumers with its luxury vehicles.\n\nHowever, the Chinese car market has softened this year as economic growth slows and consumer confidence weakens. In September, new car sales fell for the eighth consecutive month, with automakers' sales down by 11.3% from the same month a year earlier.\n\nThe decline in auto sales has been a major concern for Tesla, which last month said it was considering price cuts for some of its vehicles in the country due to a stronger Chinese currency.\n\nTesla's move is part of its effort to remain competitive in a market that has become increasingly crowded with rivals. In recent months, several Chinese electric vehicle start-ups have announced ambitious plans to expand their operations in the country.\n\nIn October, an electric vehicle start-up based in Shanghai launched its first mass-produced electric car and said it had sold 7,000 units of the car in the first three months.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese automakers have been introducing new models to meet growing demand for electric vehicles in the country. One of the world's largest electric vehicle manufacturers unveiled two new electric models at the Shanghai Auto Show in November, aiming to capitalize on government incentives for green vehicles.\n\nTesla's move comes as the company struggles to turn a profit as it ramps up production of its Model 3, which is the company's most affordable model yet. In October, the carmaker reported a wider-than-expected loss for the third quarter, blaming it on delays in production of the Model 3 and higher spending related to launching the car in new markets.\n\nDespite the price cuts, Tesla's fortunes in China remain uncertain. Analysts said it may take some time for the company to regain momentum in the Chinese market, given the increasing competition and weak consumer confidence.\n\n\"Tesla's production ramp-up in China will help the company expand in the market, but the strong presence of local and foreign rivals could put pressure on Tesla to keep prices competitive and attract Chinese buyers,\" said an analyst at a leading consultancy.", "label": "machine"}

The two chefs are originally from France and met while studying at one of France's best culinary schools, \u00c9cole Gr\u00e9goire-Ferrandi in Paris.\n\nTogether with their line cook Andrew Tu and apprentice Maxime Olszanski, the pair run the kitchen, while ma\u00eetre d' Jerome Bougherdani, who is also from France, greets diners at the front.\n\nBoullay came to New York after he was the only student in his class to volunteer when chefs from Le District, New York City's French food hall, visited, looking for cooks and apprentices to come to the US.\n\nWhile no two days at L'Appart are exactly alike, Boullay and Douay talked to Insider about what a day in their lives looks like leading the restaurant together.\n\n11 a.m. - Start preparing for evening service\n\nBoullay and Douay wake up around 9:30 a.m. and arrive at the restaurant around 11 a.m. or 12 p.m.\n\n\"The way you break down your day, you're going to start with the longest things to do,\" Boullay said. \"Then after, you do the little things with details.\"\n\nBoth chefs start the day preparing produce, cutting the meats and fish, and cleaning out the dishwasher for evening service which begins at 5 p.m.\n\nOn Tuesdays, the restaurant receives most of its orders of produce for the week.\n\nMost of the food the restaurant uses is local, with vegetables from New Jersey or the Union Square Farmers Market, and fish and meat from the US. Foie gras comes from the Hudson Valley in upstate New York, Boullay said. Pork chops are sourced from a family-owned farm in Iowa.\n\nDishes from a previous menu at L'Appart. Joalia Hospitality\n\n\"It's great to promote producers like this,\" Boullay said. \"Zero\" cheese in the kitchen at L'Appart comes from France, he added.\n\nDuring the early afternoon prep, Douay is usually responsible for preparing garnishes for desserts, like a tellicherry pepper mousse, garnished with pink lady apple and cooked in a celeriac extraction caramel.\n\nThe current tasting menu at L'Appart. Britney Nguyen\n\n3:30 p.m. - A meal together before the night begins\n\nA corner of the dining room at L'Appart. Joalia Hospitality\n\nAfter preparation is done, the four-person team has a break and shares a meal together.\n\nAt 4 p.m., the tablecloths and linens are spread, and the cooking stations start firing up.\n\nJust before service begins, the kitchen does a preview of reservations for the evening, noting any allergies and food restrictions guests have listed.\n\nDouay said that half the job of running a kitchen is having fun and the other half is solving problems.\n\nAnything can go wrong in the restaurant, Boullay said. A supplier can be unable to make a delivery, the dishwasher can break, or the fridges can shut down, and the chefs have to be able to react quickly.\n\n\"People are paying an important price for their menu, so they should have the best and not feel any issue that we have in the back of the house,\" Boullay said.\n\n5 p.m. - Service begins\n\nDinner service is usually between 5 p.m. and 11:30 p.m., Boullay said, adding that the restaurant's tasting menu experience lasts around two hours.\n\nThe 28-seat restaurant, which is open Tuesday through Saturday for dinner, is fully booked most of the time, Boullay said. Fridays and Saturdays are the busiest nights.\n\nL'Appart offers a 5-course tasting menu that changes every four weeks depending on what produce is in season. The current menu includes dishes like Royal Ossetra Caviar and live diver scallops.\n\nBy having a limited menu, the chefs said they are able to keep food waste low.\n\n\"As a fine dining restaurant, we try to offer the best experience to our customers,\" Boullay said. \"Because the menu is renewed every four weeks, we have to renew ourselves a lot.\"\n\nDepending on how quickly or slowly people eat, the chefs may have to rush to make and serve each course.\n\n\"It's a kind of game you need to play every night,\" he said.\n\nL'Appart is an open kitchen, so diners can watch the chefs prepare their meals. Douay's back is usually turned to the dining room while she prepares desserts, and Boullay and the other two chefs face the dining room.\n\nBoullay preparing a dish before it's sent out to the table. Douay is behind him. Britney Nguyen\n\nBoullay plates the food to be sent out, while Tu and Olszanski prepare plates and ingredients for the next courses.\n\nWhen the diners are present, Boullay and Douay try to avoid speaking French so everyone can understand them. But if there's a rush, the pair speak French, which Boullay said is faster and more clear.\n\n12 a.m. - Time to go home\n\nAfter dinner service winds down, the kitchen starts cleaning each station; the refrigerators and freezers are checked to make sure they are working for the morning; and the trash is taken out.\n\nThe chefs leave around midnight or 1 a.m.\n\nEven on their days off and at home, Boullay and Douay are always talking about what's next on the menu.\n\n\"We are never disconnected from the restaurant,\" Boullay said. \"I'm not saying it's a bad thing, because we are very involved and love what we do.\"", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The U.S. and other world leaders issued a joint declaration Wednesday condemning Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and denouncing threats of using nuclear weapons, an intimidation tactic that\u2019s become commonplace for Russian President Vladimir Putin since launching his invasion nine months ago.\n\n\u201cThe use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible,\u201d read the statement, composed by the world\u2019s 20 largest economies. \u201cThe peaceful resolution of conflicts, efforts to address crises, as well as diplomacy and dialogue, are vital. Today\u2019s era must not be of war.\u201d\n\nThe 17-page document marks a victory for the Biden Administration and global allies, which sought to end this year\u2019s summit in Bali, Indonesia with a statement censuring Russia for its unprovoked military campaign in Ukraine. In recent weeks, the Biden team has launched a discreet, multi-pronged effort to pressure Moscow to dial back the increasingly reckless bluster that has sparked fears the world was nearing the brink of nuclear war. Through a series of one-on-one discussions and back channels between top U.S. and Russian officials, combined with diplomatic maneuvering with other nations\u2019 leaders, the Administration has worked to get Putin and his government to stop threatening the use of nuclear weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine, where Moscow has faced mounting losses this fall.\n\nIn a rare disclosure on Monday, the White House revealed CIA Director William Burns met with his Russian counterpart Sergey Naryshkin in Ankara, Turkey\u2019s capital, to discuss potential costs to the Kremlin if it decides to use a nuclear weapon in the Ukraine conflict. \u201cHe is not conducting negotiations of any kind,\u201d a White House spokeswoman said. \u201cHe is conveying a message on the consequences of the use of nuclear weapons by Russia, and the risks of escalation to strategic stability.\u201d\n\nThe same day, President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping issued a joint-statement that said nuclear weapons should never be used, particularly in Ukraine. The rebuke was noteworthy considering Beijing has tacitly approved of Putin\u2019s actions and shown reticence to join the international community\u2019s widespread condemnation of invasion.\n\nRead more: U.S. Unveils Strategy for Nuclear Threats from China and Russia\n\nThe message the U.S. seeks to send is clear: if Moscow goes nuclear in Ukraine, it will only experience further economic and diplomatic isolation on the world stage. There are indications that the strategy, which has gathered momentum behind the scenes since late September after Putin illegally annexed four occupied regions of Ukraine then suggested he\u2019d defend the territory with nuclear arms, may be working. Putin backtracked late last month by stating Russia would gain nothing through launching a nuclear strike. \u201cWe see no need for that,\u201d he said Oct. 27 at a conference of international foreign policy experts. \u201cThere is no point in that, neither political nor military.\u201d\n\nConcerned observers are cautiously optimistic that the U.S. approach will continue to draw Putin away from the nuclear threshold, but they worry about the ongoing instability of relations between the world\u2019s foremost nuclear powers. \u201cThe Biden team has been effective in cautioning Putin not to cross the nuclear line, warning of the consequences, and quietly encouraging others with influence like China to provide similar messages to Putin. They\u2019ve done this very adeptly while avoiding provocations,\u201d says Lynn Rusten, vice president at the Nuclear Threat Initiative and former senior official on arms control and nonproliferation issues at the White House and State Department. \u201cBut they must stay vigilant. The crisis may have passed, but the risk of nuclear use will remain as the war grinds on.\u201d\n\nAll of Putin\u2019s threats have thus far appeared to be primarily for show\u2014U.S. intelligence has yet to observe changes in the posture of Russia\u2019s strategic arsenal\u2014but the prospect of the world\u2019s most powerful weapon being detonated cannot be disregarded. Biden has sought to avoid nuclear escalation with Russia ever since the first chaotic days of the war. Around 90% of the world\u2019s nuclear warheads belong to Russia and the United States, and these arsenals loom large over U.S. strategy posture as the Biden seeks to keep pressure on Putin to stop his blood-soaked military campaign.\n\nThe Administration has sought to strike a balance between supporting Ukraine with weapons and intelligence information without sparking nuclear escalation or an open war with Russia. The Biden team has been forced to adapt the strategy at nearly every turn in the conflict and determine how far the U.S. can go without crossing Putin\u2019s red lines.\n\nIn March, the Biden Administration postponed a long-planned military test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile out of fears that Russia would see it as threatening. A week later, the U.S. rejected a proposal to provide the Ukrainian Air Force with 28 MiG-29 fighter jets for similar reasons. The President dismissed calls to establish a no-fly zone in the skies above Ukraine because it would bring American pilots in direct combat with Russian pilots. And throughout the war, Biden has restrained from engaging in tit-for-tat nuclear threats in response to Putin\u2019s rhetoric.\n\nRead More: Inside the $100 Billion Mission to Modernize America\u2019s Aging Nuclear Missiles\n\nInstead, Biden\u2019s National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has privately relayed to Russian officials the potential consequences for launching a nuclear strike in Ukraine. In public, the Administration has refused to detail what penalties Russia would face for using a nuclear weapon\u2014a catastrophe that hasn\u2019t occurred since the U.S. dropped two atomic bombs on Japan in 1945.\n\nExpressing these messages in private while outwardly harnessing a coalition of nations to denounce Russia\u2019s potential nuclear use is proving to be an effective strategy thus far, says George Perkovich, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington non-profit. \u201cBut it\u2019s still early,\u201d he says. \u201cUnfortunately, we\u2019re not at a point where the risk of Russia using nuclear weapons is zero.\u201d\n\nOver the last several months, the Russian military has suffered a series of embarrassing defeats in Ukraine and late last week withdrew from the region west of the Dnipro River. If Putin\u2019s forces continue to be bogged down fighting a smaller, less capable Ukrainian army, many experts fear the danger of a wider, more calamitous confrontation with the West will rise. But the winter weather is expected to pause fighting, which may provide an opening for peace talks between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nThe return of nuclear brinkmanship on the global stage has reminded the world of the Cuban missile crisis, which is the last time the superpowers neared nuclear war. The showdown, now 60 years ago, did not develop into a shooting war or a nuclear exchange. Can we once again avert such a disaster and come upon a diplomatic resolution? Such an ending seems remote amid Russia\u2019s daily bombardment of Ukrainian cities and the mass violence there. But to survive the current conflict, the lessons of the past must be reexamined.\n\nAt the end of the Cuban missile crisis, the U.S. and Soviet Union opened numerous communication channels, and established several treaties around nuclear weapons and other issues of mutual concern through prolonged diplomacy\u2014despite being sworn adversaries. \u201cThe road we\u2019re on now is long and has a lot of curves ahead,\u201d Perkovich says. \u201cSo I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll get there, but we should at least try.\u201d\n\nWrite to W.J.

{"text": "The Trump family's impressive net worth has reached a new milestone, surpassing the $10 billion mark. This remarkable achievement can be attributed to a combination of factors, including smart investments, shrewd real estate deals, and the success of various business ventures.\n\nThe family's wealth is not solely attributed to the former President and his wife, Donald and Melania Trump, who collectively hold an estimated $2 billion. Rather, the majority of the family's fortune is contributed by the younger generation, particularly Donald Trump Jr., who has expanded his wealth through real estate investments, sales of his Montana ranch, and business dealings with his siblings.\n\nDonald Jr.'s most notable real estate deal was the sale of his share of the Elkhorn Ranch in Montana to his siblings for an estimated $26 million. His stake in the ranch, originally purchased for $1.4 million, has proven to be a highly lucrative investment.\n\nIvanka Trump, the former President's younger daughter, has also made significant contributions to the family's wealth. Her successful real estate career and investments in her fashion line, Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry, have amassed a fortune of nearly $1.2 billion.\n\nThe younger Trump siblings, Eric and Tiffany, have also achieved success in their respective careers. Eric manages Trump International Golf Club and has recently opened a series of restaurants and bars in Florida. Tiffany has a budding career in the fashion industry, partnering with Andrew Warren and Katie Ermilio on the clothing line \"Andrew Warren Tiffany Trump\".\n\nThe Trump family's wealth is further bolstered by their ownership of a $11 million beachfront estate in St. Martin, a $15 million fleet of private aircraft, and a collection of luxury cars, including a Rolls-Royce, a Maserati, and a Bentley.\n\nDespite their immense wealth, the Trump family is known for their modesty and family-focused lifestyle. According to Trump family biographer Michael D'Antonio, the family's generosity extends to both their family and strangers. They often bring special treats for their children when they travel and find ways to make donations to charities, both large and small.\n\nThe Trump family has a long history of philanthropic efforts, with the Eric Trump Foundation raising millions of dollars for the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Ivanka has also dedicated her time to philanthropy, advocating for issues such as equal pay and women's empowerment.\n\nThe Trump family's remarkable wealth is a testament to their savvy business decisions, real estate deals, and investments. With their fortune estimated to be over $10 billion, it's clear that the family has come a long way since Donald Trump's business dealings began in the 1970s.", "label": "machine"}

At the end of that, though, the nation is left with an empty glass and a bitter taste.\n\nFor many reasons, McCarthy is unfit for the speakership: He undermined the 2020 election, he is dishonest, he is (as we see) unable to marshal his caucus. But his defectors aren\u2019t really interested in a speaker who is able to keep the House organized or functional. Their ability to hold Congress hostage is a flashing red light for the country.\n\nOne can draw some very general conclusions about the anti-McCarthy clique: Its members are mostly far to the right, and they are mostly very pro-Trump, notwithstanding their disagreement on this issue with Trump, who supports McCarthy. All but two of them are election deniers, The Washington Post noted.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Kevin McCarthy\u2019s loyalty to Trump got him nothing\n\nBut the dispute in place here is not fundamentally ideological, as Jonathan Chait writes, or at least not in traditional terms. This isn\u2019t a simple question of conservative versus moderate. If it were, Marjorie Taylor Greene wouldn\u2019t be one of McCarthy\u2019s most fiery defenders in this battle. Rather, the divide is about whether the House should be able to accomplish anything at all, and whether the GOP caucus will be bound by political reality. Greene\u2019s presence on the McCarthy side indicates that she has a more realistic theory of governance and power, which says a lot about her counterparts here.\n\nToday, in nominating McCarthy on the fourth round of balloting, Representative Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin said, \u201cThere are things I want that I know are impossible to get done in this Congress,\u201d but argued that McCarthy was best-positioned to achieve what was possible. But the rebels start from a premise that nothing is impossible if they\u2019re simply dedicated enough to the cause. They believe they can wrestle the Senate and the White House into submission through force of will. The changes they seek might effectively prevent the House from doing anything, but they don\u2019t see that as a problem; stasis and refusal are tools of hard-core conservatism in their hands.\n\nMcCarthy is not an ideologue. He is, at heart, a transactional politician who thrives on relationships. When the rebels rise in the chamber and aver that their disagreement with McCarthy is not personal, they can be both sincere and at the same time spurning him in sharply personal terms, because that is what he is. He has already tried to win them over by offering concessions on some demands, including the number of representatives needed for a motion to vacate, which could force a vote on ejecting the speaker at any time. (It would also gut ethics investigations.) These concessions would make McCarthy a weak speaker if he were able to win the chair, which it appears he cannot. Watching McCarthy try to bargain with them has been darkly humorous, because dealing is in McCarthy\u2019s blood but they are fundamentally anti-deal, whether with Democrats or with him. That is, in fact, their core precept.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the Republican caucus sided with McCarthy, at least at the start of this process. But this is not to say that the rest of the GOP is innocent of the rebels\u2019 kind of thinking. Since 2011, congressional Republicans as a whole have slumped toward the belief that simply sticking to their guns is enough. Much like Donald Trump, the rebels are both continuous with recent trends in the Republican Party but also a break from them, in terms of their zealotry.\n\nRead: The humiliation of Kevin McCarthy\n\nNo example is more clear than the debt ceiling, an odd, vestigial limit on the nation\u2019s borrowing power. It doesn\u2019t actually affect spending; Congress decides what to spend and then has to pay for that (or borrow), regardless of where the debt limit is set. Refusing to borrow to pay that debt would simply put the nation in default. But Republicans\u2014including McCarthy\u2014have repeatedly voted against raising the debt ceiling anyway, claiming that that would somehow constrain spending, or tried to use it as a backdoor method to enact massive spending cuts.\n\nThe debt ceiling is one reason the outcome of this speaker vote matters: The new Congress will have to raise the debt limit or else produce a default sometime in the next few months. McCarthy has been unable to satisfy either the rebels, who want no surrender, or his moderates, who want no part of an economic catastrophe. \u201cIs he willing to shut the government down rather than raise the debt ceiling?\u201d Representative Ralph Norman of South Carolina, one rebel, said today. \u201cThat\u2019s a nonnegotiable item.\u201d\n\nBut whatever McCarthy\u2019s particular weaknesses, any speaker will face the same quandary. That might be true even of legislators with better conservative bona fides, such as current House Majority Whip Steve Scalise; at least one McCarthy dissident said he wouldn\u2019t vote for anyone who\u2019d been in leadership for the past decade. Whether McCarthy or someone else, the next speaker will not only need 218 votes; he or she will also need a miracle.", "label": "human"}

Hoewel het belangrijk is om te leren hoe je je piekergedrag in een moderne wereld \u201cafzwakt\u201d, zegt ze, is het goed te beseffen dat bezorgdheid ook een normale menselijke emotie is die is bedoeld om ons te helpen.\n\nIn haar boek \u2018Good Anxiety\u2018 onderzoekt Suzuki, een hoogleraar neurowetenschap aan de New York University, hoe we bezorgdheid in ons eigen voordeel kunnen gebruiken. Volgens haar kan het anders denken over bezorgdheid ons helpen productiever en empathischer te worden.\n\nJe zorgen maken is een natuurlijke emotie die je niet helemaal kunt \u2018uitzetten\u2019\n\nWanneer je bezorgd bent wordt het sympathische zenuwstelsel in je lichaam geactiveerd, waardoor je hartslag stijgt, je ademhaling toeneemt, en je bloed wegtrekt uit je spijsverterings- en voortplantingsorganen, zegt Suzuki.\n\nHoewel dit nuttig kan zijn in gevaarlijke situaties, kunnen permanente zorgen ook slecht zijn voor je lichaam. Langdurig piekergedrag kan het risico op hart- en vaatziekten verhogen, leiden tot aandoeningen zoals depressie, en zelfs vruchtbaarheidsproblemen veroorzaken, aldus de hoogleraar.\n\nLichaamsbeweging kan helpen tegen bezorgdheid door dopamine, serotonine en endorfine in de hersenen aan te maken. Ademhalingsoefeningen en meditatie helpen door het \"ontspannende\" deel van het zenuwstelsel te activeren, zegt Suzuki.\n\nToch is het zelfs voor mensen met mild paniekergedrag soms niet mogelijk om hier volledig van af te komen met een combinatie van lichaamsbeweging en meditatie.\n\nOok kampen er steeds meer mensen met een extreme vorm van bezorgdheid. Suzuki raadt hen aan om met een arts te praten over behandelingsmogelijkheden.\n\nHoe je bezorgdheid positief kunt benutten\n\n1. Koppel elke zorg aan \u00e9\u00e9n actie\n\nSuzuki zegt dat een simpele truc haar helpt om zorgen om te zetten in iets productiefs.\n\nMaak een lijst van dingen waarover je je zorgen maakt en bedenk praktische acties die je kunt ondernemen om ze op te lossen. Alleen al het bedenken van dingen die je kunt doen kan een bevredigend gevoel geven, zegt Suzuki.\n\n\"Vroeg in onze evolutie was de reactie ofwel vechten of wegrennen, omdat het meestal een fysiek gevaar was. Het was niet: 'Oh mijn God, de oceanen warmen op. Wat moet ik doen?\", geeft ze aan. \"Dus door aan iets waarover je piekert een concrete actie te koppelen, kom je terug bij die actiegerichte aanpak van je bezorgdheid.\"\n\n2. Weten hoe bezorgdheid voelt, maakt je empathisch\n\nSuzuki zegt dat ze altijd verlegen is geweest. Hoewel ze school leuk vond, worstelde ze met het actief meedoen tijdens de les. Toen ze zelf docent werd, gaf dit haar idee\u00ebn over de omgang met studenten.\n\n\"Ik realiseerde me dat die persoonlijke zorgen een superkracht voor me werden. Ik kwam vroeg en bleef laat, en zorgde ervoor dat ik zoveel mogelijk van die onbeantwoorde vragen [van verlegen studenten, red.] kon beantwoorden door aanwezig te zijn\", zegt ze.\n\nAls we begrijpen hoe het is om zorgen te ervaren, kunnen we mensen helpen met vergelijkbare problemen.\n\n3. Doe inspiratie op bij anderen om anders om te gaan met je zorgen\n\nWat je kan helpen beter om te gaan met je zorgen, is om te kijken naar hoe anderen dezelfde situatie zouden benaderen. \"Wie zijn de leerlingen in de klas die je het meest bewondert om wat ze doen? Wie zijn de leraren? Wie zijn de leiders in je leven? Wie zijn de schrijvers die je het meest bewondert? Hoe pakken zij projecten aan en wat is hun mentaliteit?\", zegt Suzuki.\n\nZe zegt dat dit niet bepaald gemakkelijk is, maar dat het kan helpen als je het serieus neemt. Op deze manier kun je je bezorgdheid gebruiken om de persoon te worden die je wilt zijn.\n\nLEES OOK: Hoge werkdruk en stress op de werkvloer bij krapte op de arbeidsmarkt", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Luister hieronder naar de audioversie van dit artikel\n\n15 15 0:00\n\nEr staan voor de komende jaren tientallen ruimtemissies naar de maan gepland.\n\nMaar op dit moment is er geen satellietnavigatiesysteem tussen de aarde en de maan.\n\nRuimtevaartorganisaties NASA en ESA zijn manieren aan het ontwikkelen om raketten te helpen zelfstandig naar de maan te navigeren.\n\nLees ook: Waarom we terugkeren naar de maan, en daar sinds 1972 niet meer zijn geweest\n\nToen de Artemis 1-missie van de NASA in november 2022 met succes om de maan heen vloog, toonde dat aan dat de mensheid op koers ligt om terug te keren naar de maan.\n\nDe ruimtevaartorganisaties NASA en de European Space Agency (ESA) willen in 2025 voet op de maan zetten en in de jaren daarna een permanente maanbasis gaan bouwen. China en Rusland werken ook samen om een eigen maanbasis te bouwen, waar vanaf 2036 de eerste landingen zullen plaatsvinden.\n\nMaar op dit moment is er geen gps op weg naar de maan. Astronauten kunnen niet zelfstandig navigeren en moeten tijdens hun missies vertrouwen op experts aan de grond. Maar die praktijk zal snel onhoudbaar worden met de vele missies die op de agenda staan.\n\nRuimtevaartorganisaties zijn daarom bezig satellietnavigatie te ontwikkelen (satnav) voor raketten die de ruim 384.000 kilometer tussen de aarde en de maan moeten afleggen. Ook zijn er plannen om een heel nieuw GPS-netwerk rond de maan aan te leggen.\n\nDe huidige manier van navigeren in de ruimte is duur en omslachtig\n\nFoto: NASA\n\nDe enige manier waarop je momenteel van A naar B kunt komen in de ruimte is door gebruik te maken van ingewikkelde natuurkundige berekeningen, die voor elke missie verschillend zijn.\n\nTijdens de ruimtereis is de aarde het enige referentiepunt. Dus moeten ruimtevaartuigen steeds signalen terugsturen naar de aarde om te kunnen bepalen waar ze zich bevinden en dat betekent dat er enorme blinde vlekken zijn.\n\nNASA verloor alle communicatie met Orion, het ruimtevaartuig dat werd gebruikt tijdens de Artemis 1-missie, toen het zich aan de achterzijde van de maan bevond. Gedurende een aantal minuten konden de ingenieurs alleen maar hun adem inhouden in de hoop Orion weer onbeschadigd aan de andere kant tevoorschijn zou komen.\n\nDat is omslachtig en duur, zegt hoofdingenieur Javier Ventura-Traveset van Galileo Navigation Science Office van de ESA tegen Insider. (De Amerikaanse overheid runt GPS; Galileo is de Europese versie.)\n\nWat de ruimtevaart nodig heeft is een manier waarop ruimtevaartuigen zelf hun positie kunnen bepalen, zonder dat ze input vanaf de aarde nodig hebben.\n\nHet helpt enorm om de satellieten die rond de aarde draaien te gebruiken\n\nVerrassend genoeg is het benutten van de satellieten die rond de aarde draaien de goedkoopste manier om satellietnavigatie tot diep in de ruimte mogelijk te maken, zegt senior ingenieur Elizabeth Rooney van de firma Surrey Satellite Technology tegen Insider. Haar bedrijf werkt samen met ESA aan de ontwikkeling van satellietnavigatie in de ruimte.\n\nEr zijn wel een paar grote hindernissen bij deze aanpak. De belangrijkste daarvan is dat de satellieten naar de aarde zijn gericht.\n\nDat betekent dat het grootste deel van de signalen van de satellieten worden geblokkeerd. Daardoor blijft er maar een heel zwak signaal over en dat wordt verder weg van de aarde alleen maar nog zwakker.\n\nFoto: NASA\n\nVanwege die enorme beperking lijkt het misschien onmogelijk satellietsignalen te gebruiken om naar de maan te navigeren. Maar ingenieurs zijn al tientallen jaren bezig met het ontwikkelen van hele gevoelige detectoren die diep in de ruimte toch satellietsignalen kunnen oppikken.\n\nEn daar zijn ze in geslaagd.\n\nIn 2019 waren vier ruimtesondes in staat hun positie te bepalen door gebruik te maken van gps-signalen van satellieten die rond de aarde draaien.\n\nEn ze waren toen volgens Ventura-Traveset zo'n 187.000 kilometer van de aarde verwijderd, ongeveer halverwege de route tussen de aarde en de maan.\n\nOp weg naar de maan\n\nDe volgende stap is het kunnen oppikken van signalen tijdens de tweede helft van de reis. Ventura-Traveset heeft er vertrouwen in dat dat gaat lukken.\n\nESA en NASA zijn bezig hun detectoren verder te verfijnen, zodat ze tot op nog grotere afstand signalen kunnen oppikken van de satellieten rond de aarde. Ze gaan de detectoren testen tijdens komende missies naar de maan.\n\nFoto: ESA-K Oldenburg/Insider\n\nDe ontvanger van ESA, genaamd NaviMoon, moet mee aan boord van de Lunar Pathfinder-satelliet die in 2025 of 2026 gelanceerd zal worden. Volgens ESA zal NaviMoon in staat zijn de positie van de satelliet tot op 60 meter nauwkeurig te bepalen.\n\nEr is goede hoop dat de satelliet met dank aan de detector zelfstandig om de maan heen kan navigeren, zegt Ventura-Traveset. NaviMoon weegt nog geen 4 kilo en kan veel zwaardere apparatuur aan boord vervangen.\n\nFoto: SSTL\n\nNASA werkt samen met de Italiaanse ruimtevaartorganisatie ook aan de verdere ontwikkeling van detectoren. Ze willen de eerste ontvangers in 2024 naar het maanoppervlak brengen als onderdeel van het Lunar GNSS Receiver Experiment.\n\nEr is een \"soort van vriendschappelijke concurrentiestrijd\" tussen ESA en NASA om satellietnavigatie naar de maan te brengen\", zegt onderdirecteur beleid en communicatie van de NASA, James Joseph \"JJ\" Miller, in een interview met Insider.\n\nVolgens Miller overwegen vele andere landen te gaan investeren in navigatietechnologie voor diep in de ruimte. \"Iedereen realiseert zich dat dit hard nodig.\"\n\nUiteindelijk hebben we een satellietnavigatienetwerk rondom de maan nodig\n\nFoto: ESA-K Oldenburg/Insider\n\nDe signalen van satellieten die om de aarde draaien kunnen ruimtevaartuigen misschien helpen om naar de maan te komen, maar als ze daar eenmaal zijn hebben ze weinig meer aan het signaal.\n\nSignalen reiken slechts tot wat zichtbaar is vanaf de aarde, dus de donkere kant van de maan en de maanpolen liggen buiten het bereik.\n\nHet plan is daarom de maan zijn eigen vloot van communicatie- en navigatiesatellieten te geven, genaamd het Moonlight-initiatief. Het eerste deel van Moonlight moet de Pathfinder-satelliet van NASA worden.\n\nVentura-Traveset zegt dat ESA de basisinfrastructuur van Moonlight gaat testen in 2027 en een verdere uitbreiding daarvan in 2030.\n\nNASA is ook bezig met het ontwikkelen van zijn eigen netwerk: LunaNet. Het ruimtestation Gateway dat de NASA in een baan om de maan wil brengen wordt een belangrijk onderdeel van het netwerk.\n\n\"We hebben een soort van architectuur nodig waarbij de satellieten van NASA en ESA samenwerken\", zegt Miller.\n\nMaanbewoners hebben supersnel internet nodig\n\nFoto: ESA\n\nEr is ook een meer commercieel aspect aan de terugkeer van mensen op de maan. Op langere termijn zullen maanbewoners een kamp moeten opzetten om mineralen en water te kunnen winnen, waardoor raketten naar Mars van brandstof voorzien kunnen worden.\n\nMensen op de maan zullen met de aarde moeten kunnen communiceren, goed met elkaar moeten kunnen praten en vermaakt worden, geeft Ventura-Traveset aan.\n\nUiteindelijk zullen maanbewoners toegang moeten krijgen tot supersnel internet om te kunnen videobellen met hun geliefden op aarde, films en tv-programma's te kunnen streamen en hun eigen content te kunnen cre\u00ebren vanuit de ruimte, zegt Ventura-Traveset. \"Ik denk niet dat iemand eraan twijfelt dat we die weg in zullen slaan.\"", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Following the arrest of influencer Andrew Tate in Romania on suspicion of human trafficking and rape, social media was flooded with memes and misinformation from people both condemning and defending him.\n\nTate, 36, has more than 10 million followers across platforms and has become a polarizing figure on Twitch and YouTube, thanks to his extreme misogynistic statements. Videos of him on TikTok have been viewed more than 12 billion times, as of August 2022.\n\nIn a news release about Tate\u2019s arrest, Romanian law enforcement said Tate and his brother, Tristan, along with two Romanian citizens, recruited women by \u201cmisrepresenting their intention\u201d to have a romantic relationship, then moved and housed them in Romania. Law enforcement said the women were then forced to create pornographic content for the group to sell online.\n\nRomanian authorities said in the news release they had been in contact with six alleged victims.\n\nTate has denied the allegations.\n\nThe charges follow a previously publicized investigation into Tate from Romanian authorities, and Tate\u2019s own statements about his business.\n\nAndrew Tate led away by police in Romania, on Dec. 29, 2022. Observator Antena 1 / via AP\n\nOn a since-deleted page on his website, Tate wrote that he had become a \u201cmulti-millionaire\u201d through his \u201cwebcam studio\u201d in Romania. The website page was archived on the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine.\n\n\u201cMy job was to meet a girl, go on a few dates, sleep with her, test if she\u2019s quality, get her to fall in love with me to where she\u2019d do anything I say, and then get her on webcam so we could become rich together,\u201d the website read. A lawyer for Tate didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment about his website description.\n\nDespite the nature of the allegations and Tate\u2019s history of making misogynistic statements, the news of Tate\u2019s arrest has inspired a slew of defenders of the influencer, who have employed misinformation and conspiracy theories to question the validity of the charges brought against Tate. The news has also inspired a wave of memes poking fun at the incident, some of which are based on pure speculation.\n\nPerhaps the most ubiquitous piece of viral speculation spread in the wake of Tate\u2019s arrest was that Romania\u2019s anti-organized crime agency, DIICOT, was able to locate the divisive figure because of a video Tate posted in which Romanian pizza boxes are displayed.\n\nTate posted the pizza box video amid a feud with teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg.\n\nOn Tuesday, Tate tweeted at Thunberg, referring to his \u201c33 cars\u201d and their \u201cenormous emissions.\u201d\n\nThunberg responded on Wednesday, making a joke about Tate\u2019s genitals. In response to Thunberg, Tate tweeted the video that included the pizza boxes.\n\nAfter Tate\u2019s arrest, posts quickly went viral, speculating that the pizza boxes in the video had been an important factor in locating Tate.\n\nBut Ramona Bolla, a spokesperson for DIICOT, refuted that the pizza boxes had anything to do with Tate\u2019s arrest. Bolla told the Associated Press the rumor was \u201cfunny, but no.\u201d Prosecutors said that Tate and his brother had been under criminal investigation since April, according to Reuters, when Tate\u2019s Bucharest mansion was searched by police in connection with human trafficking allegations.\n\nStill, that didn\u2019t stop the misinformation from taking over Twitter and becoming fodder for memes.\n\nAdding to the online confusion around details of Tate\u2019s case, some Twitter users resurfaced old footage of Tate and falsely claimed that he had been released.\n\nOne clip that\u2019s been viewed hundreds of thousands of times on Twitter shows Tate in April 2022 after he was taken into custody and released two days later. One of the tweets falsely stated \u201cAndrew Tate got Released Matrix attack Failed.\u201d\n\nAnother resurfaced clip with millions of views showed a segment of a Tucker Carlson interview with Tate, falsely purporting that he had been released from jail. \u201cANDREW TATE and his Brother have been Released. NO CHARGES,\u201d the tweet falsely claimed.\n\nTate\u2019s Twitter account continued to post on Friday, including the tweet \u201cThe Matrix sent their agents,\u201d which refers to Tate\u2019s embrace of \u201cred pill\u201d culture, which refers to the movie \u201cThe Matrix\u201d and celebrates anti-progressive stances. Some Twitter users pointed to the tweets as potential evidence Tate had been released. After Tate\u2019s tweet, Twitter CEO Elon Musk posted a \u201cMatrix\u201d meme, which was then shared by Tate\u2019s account. In November 2022, Elon Musk restored Tate\u2019s Twitter account. Tate was banned in August 2022 after posting tweets that included saying women bear \u201csome responsibility\u201d for being raped. Musk and Twitter didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nA lawyer representing Tate told NBC News that, as of publication, a judge had remanded the Tate brothers for 30 days, which would mean they would either stay in custody or be offered bail. The lawyer said his clients have contested the decision and Tate maintains his innocence.\n\nRight-leaning influencers with millions of followers who have previously focused on human trafficking as an issue reacted to the news of Tate\u2019s arrest by comparing it to a perceived lack of action in other cases, including that of Jeffrey Epstein, who died while awaiting trial on federal child sex trafficking charges and reportedly hosted a laundry list of high profile individuals at his numerous properties. Some, including those who had defended or platformed Tate in recent months, noted that Tate has not yet been convicted\n\n\u201cHuman traffickers deserve the death penalty,\u201d tweeted Mike Cernovich, who has 1.1 million followers and who tweeted about visiting Tate in Romania along with posting photos of them in September 2019.\n\n\u201cFalse allegations have been used to bring down critics of the establishment,\u201d Cernovich added in the tweet. Cernovich didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nConservative YouTuber Blaire White tweeted, \u201cWhether Andrew Tate is guilty or not, they skipped the entire Jeffrey Epstein client list because he\u2019s their enemy and the people on that list aren\u2019t,\u201d referring to the theoretical list of Jeffrey Epstein's clients.\n\nIn a statement to NBC News, White said, \"If Andrew Tate is guilty of human trafficking I believe he deserves a death sentence.\"\n\nOthers posted or shared an interview clip of Tate predicting he would be arrested, while suggesting the circumstances around his arrest weren\u2019t legitimate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s innocent until proven guilty. Not the other way around. Wait and see is always the wise move,\u201d tweeted rapper Zuby Music, who has 1 million followers and conducted the interview along with the clip. The rapper tweeted in September 2022 that he knows Tate but that Tate isn\u2019t his \u201chero\u201d and he has frequently promoted Tate\u2019s content. He didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTwitch streamer Adin Ross, who\u2019s repeatedly made appearances with Ross, tweeted asking President Joe Biden to \u201cpardon\u201d Tate and said \u201cDonald trump woulda been on it already,\u201d despite the arrest taking place in Romania.\n\nSome Twitter users baselessly suggested Tate was being targeted after he said he had converted to Islam. In late October, Tate publicly said he converted to Islam. In Al-Jazeera, Yousra Samir wrote, \u201cpushback from within the community \u2014 and especially from teachers and scholars \u2014 is critical because Tate\u2019s popularity represents a broader trend of red pill culture taking hold among some Muslim men.\u201d\n\nWhile some defended Tate amid his arrest, others celebrated, mocked or commented on Tate\u2019s detention through memes.\n\nOn Twitter, many responded to Tate\u2019s days-old Twitter feud with Thunberg with jokes about the interaction and Tate\u2019s arrest.\n\n\u201cIt finally happened. Someone got ratioed so hard they got arrested,\u201d one person tweeted in response to the tweets and Tate\u2019s arrest, referring to the ratio of comments to likes on a post.\n\nAnother simply wrote, \u201cmother nature always wins,\u201d along with a photoshopped image of Thunberg standing over Tate\u2019s grave.\n\nDrew Afualo, a content creator with nearly 8 million followers, posted a roughly one-minute-long video in response to the arrest.

{"text": "Evusheld injection, a new COVID treatment that people can take before becoming symptomatic, in Chicago on Friday, Feb. 4, 2022.\n\nThe scientists, in a study published online Tuesday in the peer-reviewed journal Cell , found that these subvariants are \"barely susceptible to neutralization\" by the vaccines, including the new omicron boosters. The immune response of people who were vaccinated and had breakthrough infections with prior omicron variants also was weaker against the subvariants.\n\nThe BQ.1, BQ.1.1, XBB and XBB.1 omicron subvariants are the most immune evasive variants of Covid-19 to date, according to scientists affiliated with Columbia University and the University of Michigan. These variants, taken together, are currently causing 72% of new infections in the U.S., according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe omicron subvariants that have become dominant in recent months present a serious threat to the effectiveness of the new boosters, render antibody treatments ineffective and could cause a surge of breakthrough infections, according to a new study.\n\n\"Together, our findings indicate that BQ and XBB subvariants present serious threats to current COVID-19 vaccines, render inactive all authorized antibodies, and may have gained dominance in the population because of their advantage in evading antibodies,\" the scientists wrote.\n\nAlthough these subvariants are more likely to cause breakthrough infections, the vaccines have been shown to remain effective at preventing hospitalization and severe disease from omicron, the scientists wrote.\n\nThe study examined blood samples from people who received three or four shots of the original vaccines, those who received the new omicron boosters after three shots of the original vaccines, and individuals vaccinated with the original shots who also had breakthrough infections from the BA.2 or BA.5 subvariants.\n\nFor people who received the omicron boosters, antibodies that block infection were 24 times lower against BQ.1, 41 times lower against BQ.1.1, 66 times lower against XBB and 85 times lower against XBB.1 compared to their performance against the ancestral strain that emerged in Wuhan, China, in 2019.\n\nHowever, people who received the omicron boosters had modestly higher antibody levels against all of these subvariants compared with people who received three or four shots of the original vaccines, according to the study.\n\nPeople who were vaccinated and had breakthrough infections had the highest antibody levels of any group in the study, though neutralization was also much lower against the subvariants than the ancestral strain.\n\nThe subvariants have evolved away from previous versions of omicron in dramatic fashion. BQ.1.1, for example, is about as different from omicron BA.5 as the latter subvariant is from ancestral Covid strain, according to the study.\n\n\"Therefore, it is alarming that these newly emerged subvariants could further compromise the efficacy of current COVID-19 vaccines and result in a surge of breakthrough infections, as well as re-infections,\" the scientists wrote.\n\nXBB.1, however, presents the biggest challenge. It is about 49 times more resistant to antibody neutralization than the BA.5 subvariant, according to the study. XBB.1, fortunately, is currently causing no more than 1% of infections in the U.S., according to CDC data.\n\nBQ.1.1 and BQ.1 represent 37% and 31% of new infections respectively, while XBB is causing 4.7% of new infections, according to CDC data.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "NEW YORK, Dec 29 (Reuters Breakingviews) - As with often value-destructive mergers and acquisitions, the numbers aren\u2019t adding up for dealmakers. After a record-breaking $5.8 trillion of activity in 2021, they have endured a staggering reversal of fortune. The slump will last through 2023.\n\nOnce chief executives and buyout barons recovered from the initial pandemic shock in 2020, they embarked on an epic shopping spree. The following year brought 64% more M&A, according to Refinitiv data, 40% beyond the previous high of $4.1 trillion in 2007, right before the world stared into the financial abyss.\n\nThe latest comedown is therefore understandable, especially given higher interest rates, which contributed to a 17% dip in the S&P 500 Index for the year to mid-December. Meanwhile, deal volume tumbled to about $3.5 trillion, 36% down from the same time a year earlier, though it stayed ahead of 2020\u2019s pace. Those numbers also could face at least one significant revision: The year\u2019s biggest transaction, Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT.O) $69 billion deal for video-game developer Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O), hangs in the balance after U.S. trustbusters sued to stop it.\n\nInvestment bankers are reorienting to the new reality. The emphasis will be on private equity firms seeking to deploy some $800 billion of ageing cash held in buyout funds worldwide as of late November, according to Preqin. Leveraged, the sum could plausibly back some $2 trillion of investment. Private equity firms already accounted for an all-time high of 22% of deal volume in 2022.\n\nCaught with billions of loans that investors no longer want to buy, banks want to clear out their balance sheets before lending again. Buyers and sellers also must adjust to the end of ultra-cheap money. Borrowing costs are up: Debt issued by companies with lower credit ratings yields nearly 9%, roughly double the rate a year earlier, per the ICE BofA Single-B High Yield Index. This financing environment suggests corporate acquirers will use more stock as payment, even as cash-rich industries such as pharmaceuticals can stay active.\n\nDespite hopes of recovery, the acquisition annals portend another tough year for deal advisers, many of whom already are trimming jobs and slashing bonuses. After 2007, M&A volume declined for two years \u2013 falling 52% from peak to trough, before rebounding. The same happened after 2015, albeit with a shallower 21% dip. As potentially bleak economic circumstances loom, bankers will be lucky to eke out a repeat of 2022.\n\nReuters Graphics\n\nFollow @jgfarb on Twitter\n\n(This is a Breakingviews prediction for 2023. To see more of our predictions, click here.)\n\nCONTEXT NEWS\n\nWorldwide mergers and acquisitions volume for 2022 stood at $3.5 trillion as of Dec. 12, according to Refinitiv data.

{"text": "The A-10 Thunderbolt II, also known as the Warthog, is a stalwart and heavily armed aircraft within the US military's arsenal. Equipped with twin turbofan engines, robust metal armor, and seven hardpoints, the A-10 is a force to be reckoned with, capable of engaging both ground targets and enemy fighters.\n\nRecently, a number of A-10s were spotted at an Arizona airbase, boasting a striking feature - a bold, shark-tooth pattern adorning the nose. While primarily aesthetic, this unique design serves as a testament to the aircraft's impressive capabilities.\n\nThe A-10 has been a mainstay in the US Air Force's inventory since the 1970s, with a diverse range of missions under its belt. From its initial role as a close-air-support aircraft to its deployment against enemy ground targets in the Persian Gulf War and ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the A-10 has consistently demonstrated its value.\n\nOne of the most remarkable aspects of the A-10 is its remarkable resilience. Its thick, titanium armor enables it to withstand direct hits from enemy fire, and its two turbofan engines are designed to withstand the rigors of warzone conditions.\n\nThis impressive durability has earned the A-10 the nickname \"Warthog,\" and its fearsome shark-tooth paint job serves as a symbol of its fearlessness and strength. The paint job also contributes to the A-10's recognizability as a symbol of the US Air Force.\n\nThe shark-tooth paint job on the A-10's nose originated during World War II, when American pilots would adorn their aircraft with shark teeth to intimidate their enemies and instill confidence in their own troops.\n\nThe modern-day A-10s with the shark-tooth paint job made their debut at an air show at an Arizona airbase, receiving widespread excitement and approval. The unique appearance of these warplanes serves as a reminder that, despite being a stalwart presence in the US Air Force's inventory for decades, the A-10 remains a formidable force.\n\nThe shark-tooth paint job on the A-10 is a proud reminder of the fearsome capabilities of the Warthog. Its robust armor and impressive weapons array make it one of the most capable attack aircraft in the US Air Force. Moreover, the psychological impact of its intimidating, shark-tooth war paint cannot be overstated, as it sends a clear message that US pilots are prepared to confront any adversary.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "The diplomatic relationship between South Korea and the United States is experiencing a revitalization, with the two nations planning to engage in a tabletop exercise to discuss their nuclear strategies. This exercise, titled the \"Korea-US Dialogue on Nuclear Planning,\" aims to strengthen bilateral ties and reaffirm their commitment to denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThe exercise, set to take place in Seoul within the next few weeks, is a significant step forward in restarting the formal process of nuclear planning between the two countries, which was halted in 2016 due to strained relations. The initiative follows recent talks between Washington and Seoul on issues such as denuclearization, missile defense, and the deployment of U.S. strategic assets to South Korea.\n\nThe nuclear planning tabletop exercise will focus on addressing the security concerns shared by both sides and finding common ground on nuclear non-proliferation. The purpose of the exercise is to help each side better understand the other's positions and develop a deeper understanding of the challenges facing each side.\n\nThe exercise is expected to advance the process of nuclear planning, which has been stalled for over a decade due to differences in views on the nuclear issue. The talks will also be influenced by the differing views held by Washington and Seoul on the Trump administration's approach to denuclearization, with Seoul taking a more cautious stance.\n\nA senior South Korean official noted that the exercise will serve as a platform for the two countries to better understand each other's positions on nuclear issues and explore ways to make progress in this area. The exercise will also address key challenges that have emerged over the past few years, including the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.\n\nThe discussion will focus on the need for a stronger regional security architecture and greater nuclear non-proliferation efforts. The exercise is seen as a positive step in restarting the nuclear planning dialogue between the two countries and may lead to a more formal process of nuclear planning in the future.\n\nThe talks will also emphasize the importance of maintaining pressure on North Korea to denuclearize, with the U.S. making it clear that it will not negotiate until Pyongyang takes concrete steps towards verifiable denuclearization. The nuclear planning process will need to cover complex issues such as verification, potential military threats, and ways to manage any potential nuclear accidents.\n\nWhile the exercise may not lead to an immediate breakthrough, it could help both sides come to a better understanding of each other's positions and set the stage for future nuclear planning talks.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) \u2014 A Democrat who promised to govern as an independent was elected speaker of the narrowly divided Pennsylvania House of Representatives in a surprising move Tuesday on the strength of every Democrat and more than a dozen GOP votes.\n\nRep. Mark Rozzi was elected speaker by a vote of 115-85 after Republicans were unable to convert a temporary two-seat majority into a vote to retain the post. The move to nominate and elect Rozzi only began hours before the vote, but his election also leaves questions about how the chamber will operate in the short term and whether he will remain a Democrat.\n\nRozzi, who began his sixth two-year term from a Reading-area district this week, is best known as a champion of the effort to give victims of child sexual abuse another chance to sue perpetrators or institutions that covered it up over claims that are barred by time limits in current law.\n\nThe November election was so close \u2014 and complicated by the death of one Democrat and the departures of two others who were elected to higher offices \u2014 that what is normally a highly scripted event instead became an afternoon of drama and uncertainty.\n\nDemocrats flipped a net of 12 seats in November, the minimum amount needed to take over the chamber, 102-101, after more than a decade in the minority.\n\nBut that margin is now 101-99 with the three vacancies that will remain open until at least February. Rozzi left questions unanswered Tuesday night about how the chamber will operate in the meantime and who will function as the majority.\n\nIn brief remarks on the House floor, Rozzi said he would be independent and pledged not to caucus with either Republicans or Democrats and to staff his office with members of both parties. He decried dysfunction and obstruction in the chamber\u2019s politics and said \u201cnever has this House been so divided.\u201d\n\n\u201cI pledge allegiance and loyalty to no interest in this building, to no interest in our politics, I pledge my loyalty to the people of the commonwealth,\u201d Rozzi said in his remarks.\n\nStory continues\n\nDemocrats said Rozzi will remain a Democrat and not switch his registration to independent. But Republicans insisted otherwise Tuesday night, saying that Rozzi will become an independent. Assuming Democrats retain the three open seats, Rozzi as an independent would tie the House at 101-101, when every seat is filled.\n\nAppearing with top Democrats several hours after the vote, Rozzi told reporters in the Capitol that his move to the dais was \u201ctotally unexpected.\u201d\n\nBut Rozzi said he would not make any \u201cgrand announcement.\" He refused to take questions from reporters there, including whether he will change his registration to independent.\n\n\u201cThe speakership is a nonpartisan \u2014 and I want to repeat that \u2014 nonpartisan officer of the House, entrusted with maintaining the integrity of the House,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThat will be my focus as speaker.\u201d\n\nEven so, the speakership is not necessarily a nonpartisan office, with the House coming off of a dozen years of Republican speakers who caucused with Republicans and helped lead the Republican majorities.\n\nRozzi had worked alongside Democratic Gov.-elect Josh Shapiro \u2014 and closely with Rep. Jim Gregory, a conservative Republican who nominated him \u2014 in pushing for the lawsuit window after Shapiro, as attorney general, unveiled a landmark grand jury report on his office\u2019s investigation into the state\u2019s Roman Catholic dioceses.\n\nGregory, from Blair County, said he and Rozzi had talked about such a possibility for months but did not bring it up until Gregory contacted House Republican leaders at midafternoon Tuesday and encouraged them to reach out to Rozzi.\n\nEvery Democrat backed Rozzi, as did 16 Republicans, including their floor leader, Bryan Cutler of Lancaster County.\n\nIn a statement, House Republican leaders lauded Rozzi as \u201cPennsylvania\u2019s first Independent Speaker of the House.\u201d\n\n\u201cReflecting the realities of an evenly divided chamber, it is imperative we have a truly independent voice to conduct House business and manage the House floor,\u201d they said.\n\nDemocrats had initially hoped to elevate their floor leader, Joanna McClinton of Philadelphia, to become the state\u2019s first woman speaker, although it was not clear that Republicans would support her candidacy for speaker.\n\nInstead, Democrats went along with Rozzi, who drew Republican support and overcame the rival candidacy of Rep. Carl Walker Metzgar, R-Somerset, who received 85 votes.\n\nIn the meantime, Cutler has a pending lawsuit designed to delay the special elections to fill two of the three vacant Democratic seats until May.\n\nMcClinton has moved to schedule those elections for Feb. 7, with the third special election.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Marc Levy in Harrisburg contributed to this report.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "As the CEO of FanDuel, Amy Howe accomplished a feat this year that so far no other US sports-betting platform has been able to achieve: profitability.\n\nThe company, whose businesses include fantasy sports, sports gambling, online casino games, and horse racing, in September posted its first-ever profit \u2014 when excluding certain costs \u2014 and forecast full-year profitability for 2023, at least a year before DraftKings, its closest rival, plans to follow suit.\n\nFanDuel, which is owned by the Dublin-based Flutter Entertainment, projects revenue of $3 billion for 2022 and has said that the total market for online gambling could reach more than $40 billion by 2030.\n\nAnalysts say that Howe, who joined FanDuel in February of 2021 as interim CEO and officially got the top job six months after that, deserves much of the credit for the company's growth. They say she's maintained a rigorous focus on the bottom line, while also making a series of creative and savvy business moves.\n\n\"Howe has managed to strike a delicate balance between continually reinvesting in the business while also recognizing that the market is calling for profitability,\" Chris Grove, a partner emeritus at Eilers & Krejcik, a boutique research and consulting firm, told Insider.\n\n\"That's an intricate waltz and she is managing it to perfection,\" Grove said.\n\nSeeking constant innovation\n\nThis year Howe launched FanDuel TV, a 24-hour television network, which features a mix of studio programming and live sports. She also sealed deals with the WNBA and the New York Yankees, making FanDuel the official sportsbook partner and official daily fantasy partner for the league and team.\n\nHowe, who is the only female CEO at a major US sportsbook operator, has also been instrumental in expanding FanDuel's customer base by encouraging more women to wager on sports. At the SBC Summit North America trade show and conference this year, she described the female market as an \"untapped opportunity\" and detailed a number of FanDuel's initiatives to bring more women bettors into the fold.\n\n\"You have to learn the art of influencing your stakeholders,\" said Howe. Steven Ferdman/Getty Images\n\n\"By no means have we cracked the code on this, but I think supporting female athletes and advocating for equity with female athletes is really important,\" Howe said at SBC.\n\nThere are challenges ahead, however. Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia have legalized sports betting, according to the American Gaming Association, but the regulatory environment might soon become less friendly. And while FanDuel has long had an impressive command of the US market share and recently extended its sizable lead over DraftKings, the industry is fiercely competitive and new players continue to emerge.\n\nHowe is undaunted but remains cautious. \"We're always a little bit paranoid about making sure that we can continue to maintain that position,\" Howe told Insider last year. \"We're constantly trying to figure out, 'How do we innovate?' So that our flywheel spins even faster than our competitors.\"\n\nLeaning on pragmatism and subtle influence\n\nHowe arrived at FanDuel after a successful seven-year run at Live Nation Entertainment. She held several positions, including president and chief operating officer at Ticketmaster, where she worked on the company's transition from paper tickets to digital passes. Before that, Howe, who has an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, was a longtime partner at McKinsey & Co.\n\nHowe told the \"Corporate Competitor Podcast\" in August that consulting often involves dealing with politically or emotionally charged issues, and there's an art to making such challenges less fraught. She also said she developed \"a healthy dose of pragmatism\" when she moved from consulting to being in an operations role within an organization.\n\n\"You have to learn the art of influencing your stakeholders, in many cases a broad set of stakeholders, and those people don't report to you,\" she said on the podcast. \"When I first came into Live Nation, and even FanDuel, nobody reported to me, but I got a lot done because I knew how to work in an organization.\"\n\nHowe's pragmatism and subtle influence have served her and the company well, said Grove, the analyst. \"She could have come into FanDuel and said, 'I want to do things my way,' but instead she looked around at the market, talked to consumers, and listened to her internal team,\" he said.\n\n\"And by virtue of her humility, she's been able to blend those competing perspectives into a coherent and successful vision for the company.\"", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Jim Tibensky was in the middle of trying to save a bald eagle stranded on a patch of ice in Waukegan Habor when he realized he had to alter his plan of action.\n\nTibensky had kayaked to the middle of the harbor, towing another kayak, intending to put the eagle in it and pull it back to shore.\n\nBut it turned out, the second kayak wouldn\u2019t be needed, said Annette Prince, director of Chicago Bird Collision Monitors.\n\nAs Tibensky approached the eagle, he noticed the wave created by his kayak pushed the chunk of ice on which the eagle sat. As Tibensky paddled closer, the kayak itself was able to push the ice.\n\n\u201cHe had a brilliant strategy of realizing this bird was floating on a piece of ice and rather than grabbing it, if he were to continue to push the little iceberg that he was sitting on back toward shore where I was, I\u2019d be able to reach down and pull it up with a net,\u201d Prince said.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what happened. After Tibensky slowly paddled and nudged the eagle to shore, Prince scooped it from the harbor and placed it in a cage.\n\nHer group, which operates a 24-hour hotline for bird rescue reports, had gotten a call about 10:30 a.m. Sunday. A group of birdwatchers at the harbor said the bald eagle was stuck on ice, looked lethargic and could not stand up straight.\n\nOnce they scooped it up, they took the eagle to Willowbrook Wildlife Center in Glen Ellyn, where it underwent blood tests and treatment. The tests revealed symptoms consistent with having ingested rodent poisoning, most likely from prey.\n\nAnnette Prince of the Chicago Bird Collision Monitors holds a bald eagle that was rescued Sunday from the Waukegan Harbor. Tamima Itani | Provided\n\nBut since arriving at the wildlife center, the eagle quickly warmed up and gained some energy.\n\n\u201cThey put him on treatment and that night he ate all the food that they put in his cage,\u201d Prince said. \u201cHe was actively eating, sitting up, made a big mess in his cage, kind of tore up the towels and everything so he\u2019s got some spunk in him.\u201d\n\nWhile the eagle is still not fully alert, the quick turnaround in his condition has the non-profit bird rescue group optimistic of a successful recovery.\n\nThe eagle is about three years old. The wildlife center could not determine whether it is male or female due to it being significantly underweight, Prince said. Bald eagles develop a full white head at around five years old.\n\nIt was the first save of 2023 for the Chicago Bird Collision Monitors, which rescued more than 5,000 birds last year across Chicago and the suburbs.\n\nAs it happens, last\u2019s year\u2019s first rescue also was on New Year\u2019s Day, also of a bald eagle \u2014 and that eagle also had ingested rat poison. It was found on the side of a road in Brookfield.\n\n\u201cThat one made a full recovery and was released, so we\u2019re all hopeful that the same thing is going to happen for this bird,\u201d Prince said Monday\n\nAnd of the countless rescues the group has made throughout its 20 years of existence, Prince said Sunday\u2019s was \u201cone of the more amazing rescues that I think we pulled off.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt went effortlessly, the bird cooperated, we got him safely contained and he\u2019s got a good chance to survive,\u201d she said. \u201cThose are all really positive things for the start of the year.\u201d", "label": "human"}

His third home run in the sixth inning made him the first player to achieve this feat in All-Star Game history.\n\nGonzalez and Harper also made history with their pair of home runs. Gonzalez connected in the third and seventh innings, while Harper hit a two-run homer in the ninth to cap off the AL's victory.\n\nThe three sluggers, each considered one of the most dynamic hitters of their generation, were thrilled with their historic night. After the game, they expressed their amazement at what they had accomplished.\n\nTulowitzki said, \"I didn't think I'd be able to hit three home runs, let alone be the first person to do it. It was an incredible experience, and I'm so thankful for the opportunity.\"\n\nGonzalez echoed his teammate's sentiment, stating, \"It's an honor to be mentioned in the same sentence with two of the best hitters of this era. It's a moment I'll never forget.\"\n\nHarper credited his teammates for motivating him to keep grinding and stay focused, saying, \"I just had to keep plugging away and stay in the zone. My teammates kept encouraging me throughout the night, and that definitely helped me stay motivated.\"\n\nThe AL's victory was a sweet one, as they broke their five-game losing streak in the All-Star Game.

{"text": "The Republican Party's internal dynamics were put to the test when they convened to elect their next leader, with Kevin McCarthy being nominated for the second time in a decade. However, his expected coronation turned into a surprise rejection due to the demands of a vocal group of dissidents who wanted to dictate the terms of the role.\n\nThe outcome was a temporary speaker being elected to preside over the process, leaving lawmakers at a crossroads. After ceding significant power to the House Freedom Caucus, a group of 30 to 40 hardline conservative members, they still couldn't secure the necessary support to move forward.\n\nMcCarthy, an outgoing leader since the 2014 midterms, had vowed to \"unify\" the party after its disappointing performance in the November elections. Despite being seen as the favorite to succeed outgoing House Speaker Paul Ryan, his record of hardline tactics and loyalty to President Donald Trump put him at a disadvantage.\n\nA contingent of Republican dissidents, led by House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, refused to accept McCarthy's candidacy and instead demanded a \"moot point\" vote that would avoid the outcome of the first round of voting. Facing the possibility of embarrassment, McCarthy agreed to a two-week delay to win over the Freedom Caucus, but this ultimately failed.\n\nMcCarthy won only 199 votes, far fewer than the 218 required to win, leaving the House without a speaker and potentially pushing the country towards a government shutdown. The failure to win the speaker's post is a painful blow to the GOP and its majority leader in the House of Representatives, who is struggling to recover from a record-low approval rating.\n\nThe incident shows that McCarthy's approach of appeasement did nothing to unite the party and instead sowed more discontent. Going forward, McCarthy will have to prove he can keep the party together as it looks for a new speaker and attempts to govern in a chaotic Washington landscape. The failure to win the speaker's post will undoubtedly cast a shadow over McCarthy's future political prospects.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Crossmark's Bob Doll sees another lackluster year ahead for stocks.\n\nDoll said in a note on Tuesday that he sees a recession coming.\n\nHe added that inflation would remain above 2% and the Fed would leave rates elevated.\n\n2022 was a rough year for the stock market, with the S&P 500 closing out the year down nearly 20%. Unfortunately for investors, things aren't likely to get much better for the market in 2023, says Bob Doll, the CIO at Crossmark Global Investments and former chief US equity strategist at BlackRock.\n\n\"2023 is shaping up to be another challenging year for investors,\" Doll said in his yearly predictions note on Tuesday. He said he expects October 2022 lows of 3,577 for the S&P 500 to be re-tested.\n\nDoll's bleak outlook for the market is informed by a combination of his first four predictions for 2023. For one, he doesn't see inflation falling back to 2%, and therefore sees the fed funds rate hitting 5% and staying there for the duration of 2023.\n\nThe cumulative effect of tight policy will eventually catch up to the economy this year, and send it into a mild recession, Doll believes. This will lead to downward revisions in earnings expectations, he said, as spending falls and inflation continues to into profits for businesses.\n\n\"We acknowledge the Fed could blink and acquiesce to a 3-4% inflation rate 'for the time being,' in which a soft landing might be possible,\" Doll said. \"But if the Fed insists on their 2% target, a recession is almost inevitable. In the meantime, what the Fed has already done (raising rates from zero to 4 \u00bc% in a short period of time) will have a delayed impact on the economy, to be felt in 2023.\"\n\nHe continued: \"In either scenario, analysts' estimates for earnings are still too high and will need to be reduced. The consensus forecast for 2022 earnings is $231 for the S&P 500 and $254 for 2023. Our estimates are $200 and $230.\"\n\nBut while Doll sees some downside, he also expects some upward volatility, and for stocks to start to bounce back when the economic picture starts to clear up. Conversely, he sees bonds outperforming stocks into the recession, and then underperforming when a recovery is underway.\n\nWhen all is said and done, however, he expects the stock market to stay range-bound, and doesn't see it rising more than 10%. The same is true for other major asset classes, he said.\n\nWhere to expect outperformance\n\nDoll does expect some areas of the market to outperform others, however. Generally, he likes value stocks over growth stocks, and thinks the energy, consumer staples, and financials sectors will perform best. Meanwhile, he's more bearish on the utilities, technology, and communication services sectors.\n\nThe Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE), the Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (VDC), and the iShares U.S. Financials ETF (IYF) offer exposure to the sectors Doll is more bullish on.\n\nDoll also said international stocks will beat US stocks in 2023, which would mark their first outperformance of US stocks in back-to-back years since 2006 and 2007.\n\nThe iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF (IXUS) offers exposure to stocks outside of the US.\n\nFinally, given the muted returns he sees this year for the broader market, Doll expects active fund managers to beat passive index funds this year. For reference, 80% of active funds were beaten by index funds in 2021, and index funds have generally outperformed active funds, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "NILES, Mich. \u2014 For decades, Mike Noonan was the consummate Illinois political insider. He aggressively worked on Democratic campaigns in all sorts of communities and was a big player in the behind-the-scenes jostling over legislation at the state Capitol.\n\nAfter years as a staffer and top political operative for longtime Democratic boss Michael Madigan, Noonan was a lobbyist with a long roster of clients in Springfield.\n\nBut a corruption scandal ended Madigan\u2019s long reign last year. And since then, Noonan has left Illinois entirely.\n\nLast summer, Noonan began what he hopes will be a mellower, second career as an owner of an organic marijuana farm and certified \u201cganjier\u201d in this small city in southwest Michigan.\n\nNoonan, 54, says he\u2019s done with politics in Illinois and is dedicating himself to fighting for \u201cthe craft weed revolution\u201d in his new home on the other side of Lake Michigan.\n\n\u201cLife has really transitioned, and all for the better,\u201d Noonan says, wearing a smock in the retail shop of his Southland Farms in Niles, Mich., about 100 miles from Chicago.\n\nNoonan refers to the shop at Southland Farms as a \u201cbudtique\u201d \u2014 reflecting the business\u2019 aim of providing an upscale experience and \u201cquality weed\u201d for cannabis consumers.\n\nNext to the cash register at the front of the store, Noonan proudly displays the certificate he earned as a ganjier \u2014 a certified connoisseur of fine weed. He passed a course in northern California to become one of what are fewer than 200 ganjiers in the world, trained to guide cannabis users much as a sommelier advises wine drinkers.\n\nAlthough he was not personally implicated in the Illinois corruption scandal, the native of Chicago\u2019s south suburbs says he felt it was the right time for him to leave the political scene.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe I wasn\u2019t the best at identifying the people who shouldn\u2019t be in politics, because obviously, I still like and care for plenty of folks who are now seen as scoundrels.\n\n\u201cFor me, it was time to move on. Because I had accomplished a lot, and I felt good about what I had done.\u201d\n\nGetting \u2018Noonan-ed\u2019\n\nNoonan began as a staffer for Madigan in 1994 and managed state legislative campaigns for his allies and others in the Illinois Democratic Party. He came to wider prominence 20 years ago by managing the first campaign for Illinois attorney general of the boss\u2019 daughter, Lisa Madigan.\n\nNoonan relished popping up outside her Republican rival\u2019s news conferences to offer instant rebuttals for reporters. He was so good at it that rivals griped about \u201cgetting Noonan-ed.\u201d\n\nMike Noonan managed Lisa Madigan\u2019s campaign for Attorney General in 2002. Sun-Times file photo\n\nEven before going into politics, Noonan says he had a deep appreciation for marijuana \u2014 using it since 1986, when it was still illegal.\n\nHe says Madigan became aware of his weed habit in 1996, when a competitor in politics reported him. He thought it would cost him his job but recalled his supervisor in the Madigan organization telling him he would not be fired.\n\n\u201cI had been a hard-working guy, and I think, more importantly, I had been successful for them,\u201d Noonan says. \u201cAnd so the reprimand that I got from my boss at the time was, \u2018You\u2019ve been reported. It doesn\u2019t seem to be affecting your work at all. See you tomorrow.\u2019\u201d\n\nNoonan also believes Madigan gave him a pass because he understood that, \u201cNobody is just one thing. And people can be good, and they can be bad.\u201d A lawyer for Madigan declined to comment on Noonan\u2019s recollection of that incident.\n\nComEd scandal rocks Springfield\n\nAfter helping Lisa Madigan win statewide office, Noonan became a lobbyist in Springfield for mostly corporate clients.\n\nAmong the companies he represented in the Illinois Capitol was Commonwealth Edison. The giant power utility admitted in 2020 it had hired Madigan allies as consultants and paid them for little or no work to curry favor with the speaker, who helped pass legislation that padded ComEd\u2019s profits dramatically.\n\nMadigan resigned last year and has been indicted in the scandal, but he has denied any wrongdoing and his case is pending in federal court.\n\nAccording to federal court records and sources, Noonan\u2019s then-business partner Victor Reyes won a contract for his law firm with ComEd, allegedly as part of the electric company\u2019s efforts to please Madigan. Reyes has not been charged with a crime, and Noonan says he had nothing to do with Reyes\u2019 law firm.\n\nThe situation hurt business for the Roosevelt Group, the lobbying and public-relations business Noonan owned with Reyes in downtown Chicago. Noonan says he sold his stake in the Roosevelt Group, and records show he canceled his registration as a lobbyist in Illinois in July 2021.\n\n\u201cI was associated with a lot of people who aren\u2019t in politics any longer, many of them because the federal government decided they shouldn\u2019t be in politics any longer,\u201d he said.\n\nAt that point, he said he decided, \u201cI need another act.\u201d\n\nSouthland Farms is located in southwestern Michigan. Dan Mihalopoulos/WBEZ\n\nA new career in the weed business\n\nNoonan says he is now one of the little guys trying to provide a classier, higher-quality alternative to the products offered by big marijuana interests.\n\nEverything in his store in Michigan is grown on site, from seed. Behind the budtique, Southland Farms has five climate-controlled rooms full of dozens of highly pungent, leafy marijuana plants. All the products are processed on the premises and sold exclusively there.\n\nTo become a ganjier, he underwent six months of online training, three days of in-person classes and a day-long exam in Humboldt County, Calif., in July. That same month, Southland Farms opened its door.\n\nIn Noonan\u2019s office, there\u2019s just a single reminder of his 25 years in politics: a \u201c24 hours to victory\u201d sign from an election-eve rally for Todd Stroger\u2019s campaign for Cook County Board president in 2006. Stroger won narrowly, after then-U.S. senator named Barack Obama appeared at the rally.\n\nNoonan says the sign reminds him to \u201cjust keep fighting \u2018till the end\u201d \u2014 and to not hesitate to ask for help from friends in times of need.\n\nDan Mihalopoulos is a reporter on WBEZ\u2019s Government & Politics Team.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "A Historical Perspective on Royal Family Feuds.\n\nWhen news of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's decision to \"step back\" from their royal duties broke in January, the British public was captivated by the intrigue and speculation surrounding the reported \"rift\" between Harry and his older brother, Prince William. The supposed drama between the two royals is far from new, with a long history of internal struggles within the British royal family dating back to the 1600s.\n\nThroughout the centuries, siblings and cousins have often found themselves at odds over their rightful place in the line of succession. One notable example is the rivalry between Queen Elizabeth I's cousins, Robert and Henry, who fought for the throne in the late 16th century. This intense rivalry became known as the \"War of the English Roses\" and had lasting implications for British history.\n\nIn the 1700s, King George III's brothers, Frederick and William, were rumored to have been at odds for years, with Frederick being seen as the more influential of the two. The 1800s saw another internal feud within the royal family, this time between Queen Victoria's eldest son, Edward, and his younger brother Alfred, as well as Alfred's son, Albert.\n\nThe 20th century saw the royal family's internal struggles continue, with Edward VIII's feud with his older brother George over his desire to marry an American woman, Wallis Simpson, who had been previously divorced. Edward eventually had to abdicate the throne to marry Simpson.\n\nToday, the British royal family is facing another reported feud between Harry and William. While the exact cause of the rift is unclear, it is possible that the centuries-old history of royal feuds has contributed to the current drama. The public's fascination with the alleged feud between Prince Harry and William has a long history behind it, and only time will tell if the brothers can put their differences aside and resolve whatever issues are at the root of their reported rift.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "A forthcoming alteration in the government's tax policies is anticipated to bring about a substantial increase in the maximum amount that can be contributed to 401(k) retirement accounts. This change, set to take effect in 2023, will raise the cap by nearly 10%, from $18,000 to $19,500.\n\nThis development is significant, as it comes amidst a worsening retirement crisis. According to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, Americans have a staggering $7 trillion shortfall in retirement savings. The current limit applies to both employees and employers, and employers can choose to match employee contributions tax-free.\n\nWhile this news is certainly welcome for workers looking to bolster their retirement funds, it's essential to recognize that the new limits are not a one-size-fits-all solution. Individuals who have already been contributing the maximum amount may be tempted to increase their contributions, but this may not be the most prudent decision.\n\nBefore making any changes, it's crucial to assess one's financial situation. The new limit may be higher, but it still represents a significant portion of one's salary. For instance, if an individual is carrying a substantial amount of debt or lacks emergency savings, it may be wise to prioritize those areas of their finances first.\n\nHowever, it's not necessary to ignore 401(k) contributions entirely. If one's finances are stable, they should still contribute something to their retirement savings. Experts recommend saving between 10 and 15 percent of one's salary annually. If this is not feasible, it's recommended to start with a smaller amount and gradually increase it over time.\n\nIt's also essential to review one's investment strategy and make any necessary adjustments. This may involve rebalancing one's portfolio to align with their risk tolerance. Additionally, individuals should take advantage of the tax benefits associated with 401(k) contributions, as the money contributed will be tax-deferred until withdrawal.\n\nFinally, if one's employer offers a 401(k) matching program, it's crucial to participate to maximize retirement savings. With the new limits set to take effect in 2023, now is an opportune time to review one's retirement plans and make adjustments to ensure success. By taking the time to assess one's financial situation and make small changes, individuals can set themselves up for a secure retirement.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The Bureau of Labor Statistics recently released data indicating a slight decline in the overall US unemployment rate, while certain demographic groups experienced significant increases. The national rate decreased to 6.7% in December, down from 6.8% in November, but the unemployment rate for Black women and Hispanic men showed a notable rise.\n\nThe unemployment rate for Black women rose from 9.2% to 10.3%, and the rate for Hispanic men jumped from 7.3% to 8.3%. In contrast, the unemployment rate for Black men remained unchanged at 7.5%, and the rate for white men was 4.3%. These figures suggest a concerning trend, particularly for Black and Hispanic workers who were disproportionately affected by the pandemic.\n\nExperts attribute the rise in unemployment for Black women to the pandemic's impact on sectors like hospitality and leisure, as well as the sudden shift to remote work, which disproportionately affected women who were often responsible for childcare. The increase in unemployment for Hispanic men is linked to lower education levels and a higher rate of employment in service and hospitality industries.\n\nThe rising unemployment rate for Black women and Hispanic men serves as a stark reminder of the pandemic's disproportionate impact on minorities. To ensure a full economic recovery, policy measures must prioritize these groups, providing access to childcare, education, and training opportunities. Businesses should also strive to diversify their workforces and create job opportunities for individuals from all backgrounds.

{"text": "Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), member of the House Freedom Caucus, speaks to the media after a closed-door meeting regarding Rep. Kevin McCarthy's (R-Calif.) speakership vote, on Capitol Hill in Washington, on Tuesday, Jan. 3, 2023. (Haiyun Jiang/The New York Times)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 House Republicans began their new majority rule Tuesday with a chaotic and historic debacle, an embarrassing failure to rally around a leader that showcased the difficulties they will face in performing even the basics of governing and their lack of a unifying agenda.\n\nHanded narrow control of the House by voters in November, Republicans squandered the opening hours of the new Congress they could have used to dispel concerns about their capabilities. Instead, they feuded in a disorderly display over who among them should be speaker as the most extreme elements of the new majority repeatedly rejected Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California.\n\nSign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times\n\nDespite McCarthy\u2019s prominent role in fundraising and delivering the House to Republicans and his backing among most in the party ranks, about 20 Republicans refused to support him and for the first time in a century forced repeated rounds of voting for the speakership. After three flailing attempts at electing a speaker, Republicans abruptly called for the House to be adjourned until noon Wednesday as they scrambled for a way out of their leadership morass. The stalemate meant the usually routine organization of the new House did not occur and its members were not sworn in, nor could any legislation be considered.\n\nThe paralysis underscored the dilemma facing House Republicans: No matter the concessions made to some of those on the far right, they simply will not relent and join their colleagues even if it is for the greater good of their party \u2014 and perhaps the nation. They consider themselves conservative purists who cannot be placated unless all their demands are met \u2014 and maybe not even then. Their agenda is mostly to defund, disrupt and dismantle government, not to participate in it.\n\nIt means that whoever emerges from the messy leadership fight will face deep-seated resistance when trying to shepherd spending bills and other measures that are fundamental to governance. Tuesday\u2019s spectacle reflected that House Republicans have grown more skilled at legislative sabotage than legislative success, leaving the difficult business of getting things done to others.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe rebels just don\u2019t like McCarthy, and they seem to not be able to find a way to like him,\u201d said John Feehery, a longtime Republican strategist and former top House aide. \u201cThey lack a legislative maturity to understand it can\u2019t be personal. It has to be just business.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy sought to make the conflict about something bigger than himself in an appeal to his opponents to put aside whatever feelings they had about him so Republicans could move forward.\n\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be about that you are going to leverage somebody for your own personal gain inside Congress,\u201d McCarthy told reporters. \u201cThis has to be about the country.\u201d\n\nBut the holdouts were not yet budging.\n\n\u201cI have heard nothing new from Kevin,\u201d said Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., a McCarthy foe, between rounds of votes.\n\nTo try to quell the revolt, McCarthy had already promised new rules that would open him or another figure to regular efforts to depose them from the speakership, along with requirements that would leave the leadership hamstrung and at the mercy of conservatives in trying to advance legislation.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a hard-right alternative for speaker favored by some conservatives, conceded that the legislative outlook was limited at best, considering that bills favored by House Republicans were unlikely to pass in the Democratic Senate or be signed by President Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cSo be it,\u201d Jordan said in nominating McCarthy. \u201cThey have to answer to the people in 2024.\u201d\n\nHe also alluded to what was likely to be an epic struggle to keep the government running and stave off a disastrous debt default with Republicans in charge of the House, saying that their principal task was to ensure that Congress never again passed the kind of sprawling spending bill enacted last month.\n\nThe breakdown on the House floor was the latest and most pronounced of the assaults by the hard right on its own congressional leadership in recent years. Archconservatives drove out John Boehner in 2015, denied McCarthy the votes needed to succeed Boehner at the time and complained about the stewardship of the compromise consensus choice of Paul Ryan. But Tuesday\u2019s attack was their most aggressive yet, a nationally televised implosion that showcased the intransigence and unwillingness to compromise of a segment of House Republicans at what should have been a moment of triumph.\n\nEven Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., typically a firebrand eager to stir turmoil, castigated those holding out on McCarthy because of how it reflected on the party\u2019s image.\n\n\u201cIf the base only understood that 19 Republicans voting against McCarthy are playing Russian roulette with our hard-earned Republican majority right now,\u201d Greene said on Twitter. \u201cThis is the worst thing that could possibly happen.\u201d\n\nDemocrats were enjoying the tumult to a degree but also recognized the problems it could mean down the road. Rep. Mike Quigley, a senior Democrat from Illinois, said the speaker fight was the culmination of a growing Republican ethos of \u201ctaking their ball and going home\u201d if they fail to get what they demand.\n\nOther Democrats watched in amazement as they saw Republicans open their reign with a clash that would leave whoever was eventually chosen badly undermined and the party\u2019s strength diluted from the start.\n\n\u201cWhat a weakened position they have put themselves in,\u201d marveled Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a senior Democrat from Connecticut.\n\nThe uproar in the House was in marked contrast to the opening day of the Senate, where seven new members were sworn in and senators then quietly adjourned for three weeks. While House Republicans were ensnared in a brutal internal battle, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the minority leader, was scheduled to appear alongside Biden on Wednesday to celebrate funding for a major public works project in Kentucky.\n\nAs they sought a way out of their dilemma, some Republicans acknowledged the poor message they were sending with the stalemate but also said that it was likely to be a distant memory with voters once the leadership question was resolved.\n\n\u201cJust like everything in three months that becomes small ball, it becomes insignificant,\u201d said Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo. \u201cIn a year and a half, when people are starting to think about voting again, they are not thinking about that. They are thinking about what have we accomplished. It is more important to do things than it is to have a good first impression.\u201d\n\nHis colleagues no doubt hope Buck is correct.\n\n\u00a9 2023 The New York Times Company", "label": "human"}

China has become the world's largest EV market in recent years, accounting for more than 50 percent of global EV sales in 2020.\n\nThe success of Xpeng, Li Auto, and other Chinese EV manufacturers also indicates the significant changes that have taken place in the global EV market over the past few years.

CFOTO | Future Publishing | Getty Images\n\nOne analyst maintains a bullish outlook on Apple despite shares of the tech giant falling to their lowest since June 2021 amid continued iPhone supply concerns. \"Apple is the biggest U.S. name out there, and we think it is a lot more headline risks than anything else,\" Angelo Zino, senior industry analyst at CFRA Research, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" on Wednesday. A headline risk is the risk that a company's share price will decline from negative news coverage. Apple shares fell to their lowest level since June 2021 as iPhone production is under threat from a widespread Covid outbreak in China after the country exited its zero-Covid policy.\n\nLoading chart...\n\nThe outbreak could potentially cause worker shortages at component plants or assembly factories across the country. For the last two months, Apple has already been grappling with production shortages. In November, iPhone 14 production was hit by Covid-19 restrictions and labor protests at its primary iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max assembly plant in Zhengzhou, China. Last week, a JPMorgan Chase analyst said that the supply shortfall should continue through the end of the year and weigh on the typical seasonal upshot in volumes. Apple had warned on Nov. 6 of a \"significant disruption\" ahead of the holiday season.\n\n\"While the rapid extension of lead times for the iPhone 14 Pro/Pro Max has slowed down and in fact began to moderate in recent weeks, it still remains elevated relative to the lead times seen prior to the COVID outbreak in Zhengzhou,\" said Samik Chatterjee, in a note to investors. \"Ultimately, Apple is going to do everything they possibly can to defend their business as long as they can across different geographical regions,\" said Zino. He further added that the actual impact to the top line is going to be less than 1% in the U.S. and Europe. Despite shortages, many analysts predicted that Apple customers will continue to be loyal to the brand's products.\n\nwatch now", "label": "human"}

{"text": "On the occasion of the transition from one year to the next, the leader of a prominent organization involved in a specific type of competition was captured on camera engaging in a sudden and unexpected physical interaction with an individual who was not his intended target. The event was captured by multiple camera crews and has become the focal point of a significant media controversy.\n\nAt approximately 20:30 hours EST on December 31, 2021, a live broadcast of a competition featuring the leader of the organization was being transmitted on a major television network. The broadcast included two championship matches, one of which involved the leader of the organization and a challenger. As the competitors faced each other, the leader of the organization extended his hand to make contact with his opponent.\n\nWhat was unforeseen was that the leader's intended target was not the person who received the physical interaction. Witnesses at the scene reported that the unexpected contact caused the person who received it to lose their balance, resulting in them falling to the ground. According to multiple sources, the leader of the organization immediately attempted to assist the person who received the interaction, apologizing for the mistake.\n\nFollowing the incident, a video of the event quickly spread online, triggering a media storm. Social media users were quick to express their disapproval of the leader's actions, despite the video clearly showing that the leader had intended to interact with his opponent and not the person who received the interaction.\n\nThe organization responded promptly, suspending the leader and launching an investigation into the incident. The leader released a statement to the press, claiming that the incident was unintentional and apologizing for any discomfort or distress caused.\n\nThe incident has sparked a broader discussion about the culture of physicality in the organization and its potential impact on the well-being of its participants. There is also concern about the potential long-term consequences for the leader's professional career. While it is unclear what further action the organization will take, the situation has certainly raised questions about the leader's future involvement with the organization.\n\nThe incident has become the latest in a series of public relations challenges faced by the organization. The organization has recently issued a statement condemning the incident and vowing to take all necessary steps to ensure the safety and well-being of its participants.\n\nThe incident has prompted many to question the organization's handling of situations involving physical interactions, particularly given the organization's previous denials of wrongdoing. The leader's actions have also become the subject of international discussion, with some arguing that the incident is indicative of a larger issue within the organization.\n\nIn the weeks since the incident, the leader has stepped away from the public eye. It is unclear when or if the leader will return to the organization and the sport. Until then, the incident will continue to be a topic of conversation among fans, journalists, and athletes alike.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "If you're like most individuals, you're aware that the start of a new year is an excellent opportunity to make commitments. However, instead of resolving to hit the gym or eat healthier, why not focus on your financial situation? By implementing a few minor adjustments to your financial habits, you can significantly impact your financial well-being by the end of the year. To assist you in getting started, here are five financial commitments to consider making in 2021.\n\n1. Develop a financial plan and adhere to it\n\nCreating a financial plan is one of the most effective methods to monitor your spending and save money. It doesn't have to be complicated. Start by listing your income sources on one side and all your expenses on the other. This could include recurring expenses like rent and utilities, as well as non-essential expenditures like dining out and streaming services. Once you've listed everything, compare how much money is coming in and going out each month. If your expenses exceed your income, you'll need to reduce your spending and adjust your financial plan until it's in balance. Then comes the challenging part - actually sticking to your financial plan and avoiding overspending.\n\n2. Establish a reserve fund\n\nHaving a reserve fund set aside for unexpected expenses can help you avoid taking on debt or relying on high-interest credit cards if something unexpected arises. Ideally, you should aim to have three to six months' worth of living expenses saved up in a reserve fund, but any amount is better than none. Even if you can only set aside a small amount each month, doing so can accumulate over time.\n\n3. Eliminate debt\n\nPaying off debt can feel daunting, but it doesn't have to be. Start by taking stock of all your debts, from credit cards and medical bills to car loans and student loans. Then, create a plan for tackling them, taking into account the interest rate, amount owed, and repayment timeline for each one. Once you've identified the order in which you'd like to pay them off, focus on making at least the minimum payments on all your debts while making extra payments toward the one with the highest interest rate. The faster you eliminate debt, the more money you'll save in the long run.\n\n4. Increase your retirement savings\n\nWhen it comes to retirement, it's never too early to start saving. Even if you're just starting out in your career, contributing a little bit each month to a retirement account can help you build up a nest egg for your future. If your employer offers a retirement savings plan like a 401(k), look into enrolling and taking advantage of any matching benefits. If you're already contributing, consider increasing your contributions each year.\n\n5. Safeguard your identity\n\nIn today's world, identity theft is a real threat. Protecting yourself means taking steps like regularly reviewing your credit report and being extra vigilant about keeping your personal and financial information secure. Making sure your passwords are strong and investing in identity theft protection can also help.\n\nBy implementing a few simple adjustments to your financial habits this year, you can get closer to your financial goals and have a more secure financial future. Whether it's getting on top of your budget, paying down debt, or increasing your retirement savings, even a small commitment can have a significant impact on your financial situation.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "A recent report highlights the Chinese government's decades-long endeavour to dominate the global technology landscape, which had been progressing smoothly until a year ago. Chinese tech companies had become household names in the US and Europe, establishing a strong presence in Silicon Valley, securing significant mergers and acquisitions, and transforming their domestic tech industries.\n\nHowever, China's aspirations to become the world's most powerful tech superpower have been severely impacted. After investing heavily in innovation and focusing on technology, China is now facing a crisis of confidence.\n\nChina's technology ambitions have come under increasing scrutiny from governments worldwide. The US Trump administration launched a campaign against Chinese tech companies this year, restricting their access to US markets and severing their supply chains. The EU has followed suit, imposing restrictions on Chinese tech companies and their investments in Europe.\n\nMeanwhile, within China, the once-thriving tech sector is facing challenges. Investments have slowed, and tech companies are being forced to scale back their operations. The government's ambitious plans for tech-enabled social control have backfired, leading to widespread backlash and accusations of censorship and human rights abuses.\n\nThe ongoing trade war with the US has further complicated China's tech ambitions. Escalating tariffs have negatively impacted China's economy, and the ongoing trade tensions have hindered the country's access to key technologies from US suppliers.\n\nAs a result, China's tech sector is now at a crossroads. The Chinese government is reassessing its strategy to ensure its tech sector continues to grow and remain competitive globally.\n\nOne of the key challenges is to ensure Chinese tech companies remain competitive in an increasingly hostile international climate. China is now focusing on its domestic market to maintain its tech sector's momentum. It is encouraging local companies to invest in research and development, offering subsidies and tax breaks to help them stay competitive.\n\nChina is also seeking to deepen ties with other countries in the region, having already signed several tech cooperation agreements with Asian nations and engaging in talks with other regional countries to develop new markets for Chinese technology.\n\nThe Chinese government is taking steps to address criticisms of its technology ambitions by improving its domestic regulatory environment. It is introducing transparency and accountability into the tech sector, taking steps to combat corruption and abusive practices.\n\nHowever, the fundamental challenge remains: how can China stay competitive in a global landscape where its tech ambitions are increasingly under fire?\n\nOnly time will tell whether China's tech strategy will ultimately prove successful. For now, it is clear that the country's ambitious plans to dominate global tech have faced significant setbacks.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Republican strategist Liam Donovan identified the Republican strife as \u201cmore of a reflection of underlying dynamics than a driver of them,\u201d noting that \u201cit\u2019s not as though recent GOP majorities were well-oiled machines even with higher morale and a bigger cushion.\u201d (See: Boehner, John.) The true tests of the functionality of a Republican majority, Donovan said, would be the must-pass items like funding the government and the debt limit. Indeed, the vast majority of House Republicans voted against an omnibus spending bill that skated through the Senate on a bipartisan basis just last month. If McCarthy can\u2019t wrangle his conference to vote for him as speaker in one round, he may struggle to address basic housekeeping issues like avoiding a government shutdown and preventing the government from defaulting on its debts.\n\nThe grim determination of McCarthy and his allies was countered by the exuberance of Democratic members, who appeared almost inordinately gleeful for lawmakers who had fallen into the minority. Every single Democrat supported Jeffries, many of them noting their party\u2019s unity in their votes in unsubtle digs at the other side of the aisle.\n\nSome Republicans downplayed the chaos on Tuesday morning. Representative Tom Cole, the chair of the Rules Committee, said that such \u201cdrama\u201d was routine, and wryly suggested to reporters that it \u201cmakes you guys happy.\u201d Representative James Comer, the incoming chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, said that it was \u201ctypical\u201d for the Republican conference to have such dissension in its ranks. \u201cEveryone has a strong opinion,\u201d he said.

{"text": "Many digital-health startups enjoy tech valuations without differentiated technology.\n\nThe ACME Capital partner Aike Ho said that's crashing down heading into 2023.\n\nNext year, the startups that stand out will be the ones with technology that's truly transformative.\n\nAs record investment has flowed into healthcare startups, many of them have enjoyed valuations that mirror those of tech companies.\n\nBut they largely have no real technology to speak of, Aike Ho, a partner at ACME, told Insider.\n\nInstead, they're mainly putting existing care models on the internet, and in so doing, they make a process incrementally more efficient and accessible to patients, she said.\n\nThey're successful not because they have the best products, but because they have the best contracts in place with healthcare's gatekeepers, such as health plans, health systems, and employers, she said.\n\n\"That's all crashing down,\" Ho said.\n\nIn 2023, thanks in part to the struggling economy, Ho predicts that digital-health investing will stop rewarding this approach and favor startups with true technology differentiation.\n\n\"It'll be a painful time for the industry, but I think it'll be good because it'll force us to really focus on the companies that are truly building something,\" Ho said.\n\nIt's tech's time in healthcare\n\nInsider has covered healthcare companies that have struggled to grow over the past year at the rate they promised investors. Often, companies say they can expand with the speed of a tech company, but then run into the realities of this labor-intensive industry. They end up needing more providers than they can find.\n\nHo said it's the right time for real technology startups to take off in healthcare. We're finally at a point where certain tools, from robotics to computer vision, are maturing enough to be applied to care delivery. Five years ago that wasn't the case, she said.\n\nThat's going to require digital-health investing to change, Ho said.\n\n\"It's no longer about access \u2014 it's about actually using technology that exists today to fundamentally change the unit economics of delivering care,\" she said.\n\nOne example could be Conceivable Life Sciences, an ACME portfolio company in the early stages, she said. It's aiming to use robots and software to cut down on human work in embryology labs.\n\nThat could make in vitro fertilization less expensive and less subject to human error, Ho said.\n\nBrightside Health, another ACME investment, does online psychiatry with help from an internal-diagnostic assistant that uses machine learning to help providers diagnose patients so they can take on more patients without sacrificing quality, Ho said.\n\n\"So instead of just business-model innovation, I'm looking for tech innovation,\" Ho said. \"It's not just, 'Let's put it on the internet.'\"\n\nHardcore nerds will win\n\nThe need for more impactful technology in healthcare is changing how Ho assesses founding teams, she said.\n\nGeneralized-tech entrepreneurs already struggle in digital health because there are so many \"weird\" idiosyncrasies within the healthcare system that make no sense, she said. At the same time, many founders understand those idiosyncrasies, but aren't technically savvy, she said.\n\n\"And I think those people are gonna get left behind in the dust,\" Ho said.\n\nSo the space's next winners are going to be hardcore nerds, Ho said. She's looking for founding teams with three distinct superpowers: understanding the healthcare landscape, understanding the technology behind products, and understanding that technology's clinical application.\n\n\"I think the next five to 10 years of digital-health investing \u2014 the people who are gonna do really well are gonna be the nerds,\" Ho said.", "label": "human"}

In recent years, he has put Brazil in a different light and has achieved numerous successes. But who is Lula? What makes him so special? Here are seven things you should know about Lula, the president of Brazil.\n\n1. He is the first Brazilian president from a low socioeconomic background\n\nLula was born in 1945 in Caet\u00e9s, a poor village in northeastern Brazil. His father died when he was seven, and his mother had to work hard to support him and his six sisters.\n\n2. He has a long political career\n\nLula has had a long political career before becoming president.

He has also increased the minimum wage, improved healthcare, and improved the standard of living for the poor.\n\n4. He is a controversial figure\n\nAlthough Lula has been a successful president, he has also become a controversial figure.

{"text": "A recent parade in Spain has sparked controversy after a woman appeared with a blackface mask. The mask was made of white material and covered her face, and she wore a black tunic to enhance the effect. Many people have reacted with outrage, and the incident has sparked heated discussions about whether the act was acceptable or not.\n\nThe controversy has been intensified by the fact that Spain recently passed a racial equality law aimed at reducing racial discrimination in the country. The law prohibits any act or practice that refers to racialization or racial discrimination.\n\nThe organizers of the parade have attempted to calm the situation, but their explanation has been considered partially insufficient. The person in charge of the parade's presentation claimed that they were not aware of the activity that took place during the parade and that the intention was not malicious. However, many people have questioned the justification, arguing that the use of blackface in a cultural event is inappropriate and violates the racial equality law.\n\nCritics have also highlighted the responsibility of the organizers to be aware of the possible cultural implications of their representation. The incident has sparked concerns about the impact of the racial equality law in Spain and the need for the government to take a firmer stance against the inappropriate use of blackface in public events.\n\nThe controversy has also spread beyond Spain, with many European countries drawing attention to the cultural implications of the use of blackface. European authorities must be aware of the need to address these issues with an approach that promotes racial equality.\n\nCritics have also emphasized the need for the public and organizers to be more aware of the possible interpretations and offenses that can arise from representation. This controversy highlights the need for public events to respect cultural diversity.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the inappropriate use of blackface in this year's Three Wise Men's parade is a reminder that racial equality must be a priority for European countries. Community representatives in Spain and other countries must work to address racial discrimination and ensure that parades are carried out in a responsible and respectful manner.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "It's astonishing to reflect on the past year, as we've witnessed a profound transformation in the realm of video game consoles. The anticipation surrounding the release of the latest generation of consoles was palpable, with promises of groundbreaking graphics, immersive experiences, and cutting-edge technology.\n\nFast-forward to the end of 2022, and we've seen a seismic shift in the gaming landscape, with a significant emphasis on games as a service and an influx of innovative gaming peripherals. To commemorate the end of the year and the dawn of a new one, let's take a stroll down memory lane and revisit some of the most remarkable gaming gear releases of 2022.\n\nOne of the most significant developments was the emergence of next-generation virtual reality (VR) headsets. The crown jewel of VR headsets was the Oculus Quest 2, a wire-free, fully standalone device that harmoniously combined the best of both worlds: high-end PC-based gaming and accessible, portable mobile gaming. With improved resolution, sleek design, and enhanced audio, the Quest 2 democratized VR in a way that no other device had previously achieved.\n\nAnother major highlight of 2022 was the launch of the PS5 and Xbox Series X consoles. Both devices were powerful, feature-rich, and boasted improved performance over their predecessors. The Xbox Series X, in particular, boasted impressive features such as 4K 120Hz gaming, Quick Resume, and ray tracing. The PS5, meanwhile, featured a custom CPU and GPU, as well as an ultra-fast solid-state drive.\n\nThe release of next-gen gaming monitors was another significant event in 2022. The Asus ROG Swift PG259QN, a 32-inch gaming monitor with an Ultra HD 4K resolution and an impressive 400Hz refresh rate, was the standout among its peers. This monitor was particularly popular among competitive gamers, offering both silky-smooth frame rates and breathtaking visuals.\n\nGaming keyboards and mice also received a significant overhaul in 2022. The Razer Huntsman Elite, a fully customizable RGB mechanical keyboard, was a fan favorite, featuring a detachable wrist rest, dedicated media controls, and a state-of-the-art optical switch for unparalleled accuracy. In the mice department, the Razer Viper Ultimate, a fully-loaded gaming mouse, made a splash with its maximum dpi of up to 20,000, remarkable 0.2ms response time, and 8 programmable buttons for ultimate customization.\n\nNo discussion of gaming gear would be complete without mentioning gaming chairs. The DXRacer RS57, with its sleek, modern design, adjustable backrest, and built-in lumbar support cushion, was a popular choice. The noblechairs Epic Series, featuring a durable PU leather exterior, adjustable armrests, and a maximum recline angle of 135 degrees, was another standout.\n\nFinally, a new piece of gear that has become an essential component of our gaming arsenal is the Logitech G Pro X Superlight wireless gaming mouse. Designed to provide gamers with the ultimate balance of comfort, performance, and style, this mouse is incredibly light, weighing in at just 74g, while still featuring a 16,000dpi optical sensor and 1ms of latency.\n\nIn conclusion, 2022 was a remarkable year for gaming gear, with a wide range of innovative products that have elevated the gaming experience. Here's to hoping that the coming years will bring even more exciting developments in the world of gaming peripherals.", "label": "machine"}

She must apologize, and affirm the legitimacy of the election results, or she must resign.\"\n\nThe emails, which were sent on January 9, reflected a week-long struggle between the two sides, including Kloss responding to those who took issue with her position.\n\nThe disagreement between Hicks and Kloss dates back to 2017, when Hicks, then a campaign advisor, encouraged Kloss to distance herself from her former fianc\u00e9, Joshua Kushner, after his family's support of the President led to a falling out.\n\nKloss, who remained unapologetic in her stance against the Trump supporters' actions, never apologized for the tweets or backed away from them. Despite the rift, however, Kloss and Kushner are now married and have welcomed their first child.\n\nThe emails showed that Hicks believed Kloss' comments were inappropriate and could be seen as a \"betrayal\" of Ivanka Trump.\n\nIt was reported that Hicks was a close confidant to Ivanka and was often regarded as \"Ivanka's publicist\" in the White House.\n\nWith the emails revealing a deep-seated animosity between the two sides, the once tight relationship between Kloss and the Trumps appears to be on shaky ground.\n\nWhile the emails did not reveal the final outcome of the dispute, it appears that Kloss is standing by her stance, while Hicks continues to defend the former first family.\n\nIt remains unclear whether the two will ever reconcile, but the emails showed that Hicks is determined to ensure that Kloss pays for her stance against the Trumps.", "label": "machine"}

Una lucha que ya relataron las trabajadoras de Galicia, quienes denunciaban un agravio comparativo frente al resto de empleados de otras divisiones.\n\nOtro asunto, probablemente el m\u00e1s sensible, es la intenci\u00f3n de reformar el sistema de comisiones del personal de tiendas con la premisa de \"garantizar un impacto significativo en la retribuci\u00f3n de las plantillas\". Fuentes sindicales explican que se busca que se contemple el impacto la inflaci\u00f3n en el poder adquisitivo con f\u00f3rmulas que \"no s\u00f3lo eviten esa p\u00e9rdida, sino que la mejoren\".\n\n\"No puede cobrar lo mismo una trabajadora de Inditex que de una mercer\u00eda local\", explicitan.\n\nEsta \u00faltima premisa se suma al acuerdo logrado a nivel estatal hace unos meses entre UGT y CCOO, en el que ya se logr\u00f3 recuperar el incentivo de dependientes en todo el grupo, aumentando su cuant\u00eda a 1.000 euros a abonar en la n\u00f3mina de febrero de 2023.\n\n\"Naomi Campbell, \u00bfd\u00f3nde est\u00e1?\": as\u00ed se est\u00e1 viviendo la huelga de las dependientas de Inditex de La Coru\u00f1a, la \"m\u00e1s masiva\" de su historia\n\nEl punto discordante, explican fuentes sindicales a Business Insider Espa\u00f1a, es que esta cuant\u00eda se \"queda corta\" porque el compromiso de Inditex es hacerla efectiva este pr\u00f3ximo a\u00f1o. Es decir, no hay un acuerdo para asegurarla en los pr\u00f3ximos ejercicios.\n\nDe fondo tambi\u00e9n la intenci\u00f3n de impulsar los convenios colectivos provinciales que est\u00e1n paralizados \u2014alguno desde hace m\u00e1s de 10 a\u00f1os\u2014, lo que en la pr\u00e1ctica implica el congelamiento de los salarios de las personas afectadas.\n\nCon todo, el incendio laboral en Galicia ha cesado pero no as\u00ed en Madrid, donde la CGT adelant\u00f3 a este medio que ir\u00e1 finalmente a huelga el pr\u00f3ximo 7 de enero.\n\nAs\u00ed, y si nada lo impide, los dependientes de tienda de Zara, Lefties, Pull and Bear y Kiddy's Class tendr\u00e1 su particular spin off laboral en la capital de Espa\u00f1a.\n\nPor qu\u00e9 el cisma sindical en Inditex no ha terminado\n\nFuentes sindicales sostienen que desde CCOO no se ha gestado la iniciaci\u00f3n de esta mesa sindical, pese a sumarse ahora a ella, tal y como recoge un comunicado hecho p\u00fablico hoy.\n\nEn ella, sostienen que \"las pasadas semanas desde CCOO \u2013y de forma coordinada con UGT\u2013 han planteado a Inditex formalizar este encuentro\". Algo que otra voces echan por tierra.\n\nDe hecho, no es la primera vez que queda patente la lucha sindical que nace alrededor de la multinacional textil.\n\nDesde la CIG, el sindicato mayoritario en Galicia del grupo, ya denunciaron que CCOO se mantuvo de perfil durante el conflicto e, incluso \u2014sostienen\u2014 tuvo un papel desmovilizador en las sucesivas huelgas que finalmente cristalizaron en una mejora sindical para los trabajadores de tienda.\n\nTanto es as\u00ed que el cisma sindical vivi\u00f3 su punto m\u00e1s \u00e1lgido con un sorpresivo acuerdo firmado de forma estatal por UGT y CCOO, con el que UGT de A Coru\u00f1a mostr\u00f3 su desacuerdo y, por ello, la batalla sigui\u00f3 hasta llegar a la posici\u00f3n actual.\n\nDe hecho, el responsable estatal de UGT en Inditex, Alvaro Cajigal, hizo menci\u00f3n en un reciente comunicado que Comisiones Obreras no se sum\u00f3 a las movilizaciones, entendiendo tal y como dijo, que el acuerdo estatal era suficiente.\n\nAhora, parece que la posturas son otras y, en su comunicado, CCOO valora positivamente la concreci\u00f3n de esta mesa para comenzar 2023 \"avanzando, de forma significativa, en todas las marcas y territorios con presencia de Inditex\".", "label": "human"}
{"text": "A mysterious occurrence transpired on January 1st, 2023, at approximately 3am local time in Luhansk, eastern Ukraine, involving unidentified aggressors and Russian troops stationed in the area. The incident resulted in the wounding of at least three Russian soldiers, according to initial reports.\n\nPreliminary investigations suggest that the assailant utilized automatic rifles, but Ukrainian authorities have yet to confirm the identity or motives of the attacker. The event has sparked a heated debate regarding the security of the Ukrainian-Russian border, particularly in light of the ongoing tensions between the two nations.\n\nThis article will provide a concise overview of the current understanding surrounding the incident.\n\nWhat Transpired?\n\nAt approximately 3am on January 1st, an unknown perpetrator launched an attack on a military outpost in Luhansk, Ukraine, leaving three Russian soldiers injured. Ukrainian authorities have characterized the incident as an act of terrorism.\n\nThe assailant is believed to have employed an automatic rifle, and no information has been released regarding their identity or whereabouts. In response to the attack, the Ukrainian government has ordered the closure of all security checkpoints along the Ukrainian-Russian border.\n\nFollowing the incident, Russian authorities expressed concern about the security situation in eastern Ukraine, suggesting that the attack may be part of a larger campaign against Russian forces in the region.\n\nReactions\n\nThe Ukrainian government swiftly condemned the violence and called for an investigation into the incident. The Ukrainian Interior Minister emphasized that the country's security forces had been on high alert for any attempts to destabilize the region.\n\nRussia has also expressed outrage, with President Vladimir Putin describing the attack as \"barbaric and completely unacceptable.\" The Kremlin called for a thorough investigation and warned that it would \"take all necessary steps to ensure the safety of its citizens.\"\n\nThe international community has also condemned the attack, with the United Nations Security Council issuing a statement expressing its \"grave concern\" and calling for a \"prompt, independent, and transparent investigation.\"\n\nImplications\n\nThe New Year's Eve attack on Russian troops in Ukraine has heightened concerns about the security of the region and the potential for further escalations in tensions between the two nations.\n\nThe Ukrainian-Russian border has been a point of contention for several years, and the attack has only increased the likelihood of further violence in the region. The outcome of the incident and its repercussions for both countries remain uncertain.\n\nOne thing is clear, however: the incident has further strained relations between Ukraine and Russia and raised the stakes of any potential military conflict in the region. It is likely that the two countries will seek to resolve the situation diplomatically, but the attack may serve as a reminder that the security situation in eastern Ukraine is increasingly volatile.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The fiscal calendar has entered a period of heightened uncertainty, with the midterm elections in the rearview mirror and the market awaiting clarity on the economic trajectory. Historically, the stock market has experienced a post-midterm rally, but this time, concerns about inflation and recession may temper the optimism.\n\nThe consumer price index has been steadily increasing, reaching a two-year high, while core inflation has reached a five-year high. These modest increases have still managed to rattle investors and stoke fears of a potential recession. The yield curve has also been flattening, a sign that the market expects economic growth to slow down.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been increasing interest rates, which helps curb inflation but can also slow economic growth. The central bank is expected to continue raising rates gradually to keep inflation in check, but a rapid increase could push the economy into a recession.\n\nThe political situation in Washington is also contributing to the uncertainty, with lawmakers split on key issues. This could make it challenging to pass legislation that could stimulate economic growth. As a result, any post-midterm rally will likely be influenced by inflation and recession worries.\n\nInvestors will be closely monitoring the economic data and political developments in the coming months to determine the strength of the stock market rally. The economic picture is far from clear, but it is certain that inflation and recession concerns will play a significant role in shaping the market's trajectory.", "label": "machine"}

Some years ago \u2014 all right, about 40 \u2014 having little or no money in my pocket, and nothing particular to interest me in business, I thought I would write for newspapers a little and see the inky part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the ...\n\nOK, enough of that. If riffing on \u201cMoby Dick\u201d is an odd way to begin my first column of 2023, stick with me. We\u2019ll circle back.\n\nNo sooner had I polished my blog post for Tuesday when Facebook tossed up an ad for Jasper. \u201cWrite blog posts 10x faster using AI, without sacrificing quality,\u201d it promised. \u201cCreate high quality articles in seconds.\u201d\n\nOpinion bug Opinion\n\n\u201cIn seconds\u201d?! And just as good? Well, sign me up! I clicked on the link, and came to the page for \u201can app that uses AI to create any kind of content you need\u201d according to the explanatory video, where a jumpy woman \u2014 older, tired, \u2014 despairs at saying something fresh about socks until Jasper, personified into a little robot friend, offers up this line: \u201cThe perfect pair of socks is like a hug for your feet.\u201d\n\n\u201cHot damn, that\u2019s good!\u201d she marvels.\n\nIs it? Hold that thought while I make sure those readers who still carry cash are following along.\n\n\u201cAI\u201d stands for \u201cartificial intelligence.\u201d It\u2019s the same collection of circuits that makes a calculator work, but complicated enough to mimic human thought, supposedly.\n\nIf you assume AI is a long way from affecting daily professional journalism, you weren\u2019t looking closely at Friday\u2019s column, about medical decisions. A full-service columnist, I write my headlines \u2014 unaided by tools like Sassbook AI Headline Generator \u2014 and try to pick my own art, to perhaps delay the day when I\u2019m ushered out into the pasture of the tragically defunct.\n\nI searched Merlin, our Sun-Times photo database, looking for some retro black-and-white image of a doctor in a white jacket. Finding nothing close, I looked at my own photos of hospitals. Busy and grim. I tried the Library of Congress and the Metropolitan Museum of Art banks of public domain images. Nothing. Twenty minutes of fruitless searching. Then I sighed, jumped onto Dall-E, the graphic AI provider, and created a free, useable image in about 10 seconds.\n\nDid I have qualms? Sure. Primarily that our excellent human staff photographers would notice and hate me quietly in their hearts. But my primary directive is to do what is necessary to improve the final product. Nobody seemed to notice.\n\nWould I someday use Jasper to craft a more felicitous phrase? Why not? I use a thesaurus if I can\u2019t immediately put my finger on the right term. I use a dictionary. For the top of my column today, I cribbed from my 1930 copy of \u201cMoby Dick,\u201d which is basically what AI does.\n\nA lot of creativity is judicious borrowing. The lady in the Jasper video might find \u201cThe perfect pair of socks is like a hug for your feet\u201d an epiphany, but a skeptical real live journalist who plugs that phrase into Google discovers plenty of footwear companies \u2014Crocks, Bombas, UGG slippers \u2014 have used that exact phrase for years. What Jasper does is take what you\u2019re looking for, scour the internet, hoover up a bunch of old work, mash it together, then spit it back at you.\n\nA person could do that (and does \u2014 \u201ctragically defunct\u201d is used by Nicholson Baker in his novel \u201cThe Mezzanine\u201d). Graphic artists complain that while Dall-E doesn\u2019t rip off any particular work, it forms a pastiche by processing millions of images and patching together variations on a theme. That also is not new: There was a guy at the Tribune who read a lot of Mike Royko columns, then spent the rest of his career regurgitating a pale facsimile of Royko\u2019s style. Can we really fault technology for being as derivative as people are? (Not to mention as racist. The three doctors that Dall-E served up were all white; a problem with AI generators. At first, the criminals Dall-E served up were usually Black).\n\nIs this important? Maybe caring whether something is original or not is very 20th century of me. Why not use AI to wipe the fingerprints off your plagiarism? Heck, why read anything at all when you can slide onto Instagram and spend 15 minutes or an hour or two watching snippets of \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d intercut with astounding car crashes and Jenna Ortega dancing to \u201cGoo Goo Muck\u201d?\n\nThe answer, I think, is that being a human is difficult, or at least challenging, and takes effort, imagination and integrity. Or should. Given how bad humans are at being human, often, despite 100,000 years of beta testing, we shouldn\u2019t expect machines to come close anytime soon.\n\nUntil then, times change, and we change with them. I tried to sign up for Jasper, but they want $82 a month for \u201cEverything in Starter plan + powerful tools for writing full length content (like blog posts) with added control & flexibility.\u201d I bet Jasper wrote that one. Maybe later. For now, Sassbook AI Headline Generator, like Dall-E, or your corner drug dealer, gives away free samples. I plugged the beginning of this column into Sassbook and it offered me the headline: \u201cMoby Dick: \u2018Jasper\u2019 is a robot that makes blog posts 10x faster.\u201d Completely wrong.\n\nI bet I can come up with something far better, and as long as that\u2019s true, I have at least a fraying thread of job security to hang from. As for \u201cMoby Dick,\u201d it\u2019s quite a good book, despite a fixation on whaling and nothing about Jasper. I recommend reading it while people, you know, still read stuff.", "label": "human"}

Las delegaciones incluyeron nueve monarcas junto con 70 presidentes y primeros ministros.\n\nDurante los seis d\u00edas entre la muerte de Juan Pablo II y su funeral, aproximadamente 3 millones de personas vinieron a presentar sus respetos finales. Cada hora, 21.000 personas pasaban por la Bas\u00edlica de San Pedro. La espera promedio para ver al papa fue de 13 horas.\n\nDignatarios y l\u00edderes religiosos hicieron fila en la plaza el jueves, con capacidad para aproximadamente 60.000 personas, para la ceremonia. El primer ministro Petr Fiala de la Rep\u00fablica Checa estuvo entre los asistentes, seg\u00fan CNN Prima, afiliada de CNN.\n\nLa ceremonia fue similar a la de un papa reinante pero con algunas modificaciones. Benedicto XVI fue nombrado papa em\u00e9rito durante el funeral y el lenguaje de algunas oraciones fue diferente porque \u00e9l no era el papa reinante cuando muri\u00f3.\n\nFrancisco comenz\u00f3 a dirigir la misa el jueves por la ma\u00f1ana, durante la cual pronunci\u00f3 una homil\u00eda alrededor de las 10 a.m. hora local (4 a.m. ET).

{"text": "A prominent GOP figure has expressed concerns about the ethics of a freshman senator and suggested he might need to reevaluate his position.\n\nIn a recent interview, Senator John McCain from Arizona expressed his concerns about the growing cloud of suspicion surrounding Senator George Santos from New York. McCain believes that Santos should seriously consider whether he should continue serving in office.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Santos began when it was reported that he accepted significant campaign donations from defense contractors in exchange for access to military resources. Santos initially denied any wrongdoing but later apologized and vowed to cooperate with any investigation.\n\nMcCain believes that Santos should be held accountable for his actions and that resigning might be the best way to do so. He understands that this would be a difficult decision for Santos and his family, but sometimes the most difficult option is the best one.\n\nThe situation has put the Senate GOP in a challenging position, as they are struggling to maintain their majority. If Santos is forced to resign, it could lead to a costly special election and potentially result in the loss of Republican control of the Senate.\n\nIt is unclear how the situation will unfold in the long term, but McCain's comments could have a significant impact on the political landscape. With Santos's support waning, Republicans are facing increasing pressure to push him out. If Santos does resign, it could give Democrats an opportunity to gain the upper hand in the Senate.\n\nFor his part, Santos remains committed to staying in office and continuing to serve the people of New York. Only time will tell how the situation will be resolved, but it seems clear that Santos's tenure in the Senate is in jeopardy.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Only a handful of women have successfully merged high fashion and the American frontier: TV cowgirl Dale Evans and her signature white boots, Dolly Parton\u2019s hand-embroidered Nudie Cohn suits, Beyonc\u00e9 in a black Stetson hat. In 1998, country-pop singer Shania Twain left her mark on Western wear with a hooded leopard one-piece in the \u201cThat Don\u2019t Impress Me Much\u201d music video. The catsuit launched a thousand halloween costumes and a fervor for blends of caramels, browns, and blacks that hasn\u2019t waned since. Twain has worn leopard print on album covers, talk-show appearances, and even during her \u201cLet\u2019s Go!\u201d Las Vegas residency. For the singer, one of the best things about being a woman\u2014besides the prerogative to have a little fun\u2014is wearing leopard print with abandon. \u201c[It\u2019s] my neutral,\u201d she explains.\n\nIn this month\u2019s Clothes of Our Lives column, we are celebrating all things Cowgirl Couture with Twain, who has new music out later this month and an album due in 2023. Below, in her own words, she takes us inside her long-standing relationship with leopard print, explains why the latest Western fashion cycle is \u201csexy,\u201d and reveals her personal fashion motto. When Twain walked in the room for our interview, she had on\u2014what else?\u2014a fabulous black and blue leopard-print jumpsuit. Let\u2019s go girls.\n\nSome people say \u201cwhite is my neutral\u201d or \u201cblack is my neutral.\u201d For me, leopard print is my neutral. When I first started shooting music videos at the very beginning of my career, I would gravitate to all the leopard print options on the rack during the styling process. I just felt like it was the no-fail neutral that I could wear with anything. You can dress it up, you can dress it down. It is a staple print because you can put leopard on velvet or chiffon or sheer or silk. Anything. It\u2019s hyper flexible.\n\n\n\nMy most famous leopard-print outfit is probably the \u201cThat Don\u2019t Impress Me Much\u201d catsuit, which was based on a fabric that [fashion designer] Marc Bouwer had in his showroom. It was a stretch velvet. I fell in love with the way it moved. When you\u2019re running around and dancing and jumping and doing quick changes, your outfit has got to be durable. I never want to feel restricted when I\u2019m performing. So it starts with comfort. It always does with me. Whatever I\u2019m going to wear on stage, it has to be comfortable.\n\nSo I said to Marc, \u201cLet\u2019s go with midriff\u2014oh, and I like a flare leg.\u201d Getting the outfit together for \u201cThat Don\u2019t Impress Me Much\u201d was very collaborative. I knew we were going to be shooting out in the desert, so I needed to be comfortable for 12 hours standing on my feet. That meant platforms and layers so that I could take my jacket off to cool down.\n\nShania Twain (left) on her \u201cNow\u201d tour and (right) in the \u201cThat Don\u2019t Impress Me Much\u201d music video. Getty Images\n\nMore recently, I wore leopard print on my \u201cNow\u201d tour. Essentially, I took it from warm gold tones to black and white. I wanted the dress to be glamorous for the stage, flowing, and easy to wear. Even though it looks like a gown, it\u2019s actually sporty. Under the dress was a matching stretch bodysuit that allowed me to move around and be very flexible. [It was] still glamorous, but gave me room to dance and move and jump around. It served a purpose. The design was deliberate for that reason. I wanted the feeling of a trench coat, like in the \u201cThat Don\u2019t Impress Me Much\u201d video. Now that I think about it, I should have put a hood on it! Maybe I\u2019ll do a different one in another color and put a hood on that one.\n\nI\u2019m actually wearing leopard print today. [Editor\u2019s note: When Twain sat for this interview, she had on a blue and black leopard print Diane von Furstenberg .] I love the fact that it\u2019s not in classic colors. You can have so much fun with leopard print. It belongs everywhere, from haute couture to a girl out riding a horse with her leopard-print cowboy hat.\n\nAt my shows, I get girls wearing leopard-print cowboy hats with leopard-print fringe jackets. It\u2019s so adaptable, and there are a lot of cool girls out there wearing it as part of their own personal fashion\u2014especially with denim. Denim looks great with leopard print. It\u2019s kind of rock-and-roll-cowgirl-chick. Cowgirl style today is quite sexy and playful. I like to go to rodeos and see how the girls are wearing fitted jeans so beautifully. Rodeo jeans have stretch in them now, so you can wear fitted clothing that still moves and stretches. Cowgirl fashion has come a long way in still allowing you to feel sexy and get your job done.\n\nI\u2019m a big horse rider. When I ride, I\u2019m usually wearing leggings or riding pants, with this pink embroidered shirt that I love. I can\u2019t believe there are no stains on it. There should be all kinds of horse stains on it, but it just never quits. The embroidery reminds me of something that Orville Peck might wear. It\u2019s got a funky Western vibe.\n\nIf I really want to get into a Western spirit, I\u2019ll also wear cowgirl boots. The best cowgirl boots are the ones that are comfortable right off the bat\u2014ones you don\u2019t have to wear in to be comfortable. You\u2019ve got to be able to run in them right off the bat. That\u2019s just my personal feeling about a great cowgirl boot.\n\nI don\u2019t usually ride in cowgirl hats, but I do wear them when I go out. Cowgirl hats give you height\u2014plus they are great for bad hair days. I have a lot of bad hair days. Hats are the perfect finishing touch after you get off a horse and need to do a quick change for going out to dinner. I don\u2019t want to have to fuss with my hair, so I just stick it back in a bun or a ponytail. I put on a great cowgirl hat and, poof, I look dressed up. I love a Stetson. They\u2019re very flattering, really good quality hats. I wouldn\u2019t ride in one, because they\u2019re too pretty. And trust me, when I\u2019m riding, I\u2019m getting dirty. So I don\u2019t want to get a Stetson dirty.\n\n\n\nMy fashion motto is: Wear what is comfortable so that you wear it with confidence. I also really love recycling fashion from my past wardrobe, or going to shops that have vintage things. I\u2019m not a slave to new fashion in that way. People are always giving me advice on fashion. I don\u2019t always get it right. Except for leopard print\u2014that I do get right.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.", "label": "human"}

Unemployment among Latino women also ticked up to 3.7% from 3.6%. Those figures bucked the trend in the broader economy, which showed unemployment in the U.S. fall to 3.5% from 3.7%. It was 0.2 percentage points below consensus expectations from the Dow Jones.\n\n\"What we've really seen over the course of the last nearly three years since the pandemic hit, is that we've regained, in terms of aggregate numbers, all of the jobs lost,\" said Michelle Holder, a distinguished senior fellow at Washington Center for Equitable Growth. \"But the sort of industrial mix has changed, and has kind of impacted what we're seeing with regard to the distribution of joblessness, by gender, race and ethnicity. And it's really disaffecting Black women and Latinx men,\" Holder added. A stronger-than-expected December jobs report continued to suggest a robust labor market, even as lighter-than-expected wage growth fanned some investor hopes that inflation may be coming down.

For 2023, my New Year\u2019s resolution is learning more languages and meeting new people.\u201d\n\nArmani Beauty\n\nAnd while the jet-setting starlet is a regular on the red carpet and helped popularize the ostentatious, blinged-out, pigmented makeup looks we saw on Euphoria, don\u2019t let the bright lights and flawless full-face makeup applications fool you. \u201cI\u2019m such a minimalist,\u201d Sweeney admits. In fact, she hopes makeup trends steer in this direction for 2023, urging people to \u201clean more towards that and just embrace all of our own inner beauty.\u201d Because when the camera is not on, that is precisely how Sweeney approaches her makeup: \u201cI\u2019ll use a little bit of Armani Luminous Silk Foundation underneath my eyes and on any little blemishes that I have. Then a nude blush.\u201d After this, she brushes her eyebrows and heads out the door.\n\nMore From ELLE\n\nHer preferred \u201cno makeup\u201d makeup look requires a good skincare routine for healthy, hydrated, and clear skin. It\u2019s no secret that Sweeney is an avid skincare lover, something she delved more into during the pandemic. \u201cMy number one rule is to wash my face no matter how tired I am,\u201d she says. However, we all have at least one skincare faux pas; for Sweeney, it\u2019s sunscreen. \u201cI know I should put sunscreen on every day. I\u2019m trying to get better at that,\u201d she admits.\n\nAnd while the new year can be about breaking old habits, for Sweeney, she\u2019s embracing the past\u2014starting with her natural hair color.

She confessed to us that she\u2019s a natural brunette, revealing the color change was prompted by her hair literally falling out. \u201cI was bleaching it so much,\u201d she reveals. \u201cIt just started falling out. It was so dead\u2026it was horrible.\u201d Of course, Sweeney has been blonde for her biggest roles thus far (Cassie on Euphoria, Olivia in The White Lotus). She switched to red for her most recent project, National Anthem, before reverting back to her signature look. \u201cI was terrified that if I colored it again, I\u2019d be bald,\u201d she says. So she cut off the remaining remnants of blonde in her hair. \u201cAll of a sudden, it started growing so fast, like, beyond fast, and now we\u2019re here.\u201d\n\nNew Year, same old Sydney.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "London CNN \u2014\n\nIn May 2017, Sophie Bichener did what many in their twenties are unable to do: buy a home. She paid around \u00a3230,000 (around $295,000 at the time) for her two-bedroom apartment in a high-rise building in a town north of London, where a train could get her to work in the capital in less than half an hour. She had her foot on the first rung of Britain\u2019s housing ladder, an increasingly difficult feat, and it felt like the only way was up.\n\nA month later, Bichener woke up to news that would change her life. A fire had broken out at a similar block to hers: the 24-story Grenfell Tower in west London, which was encased in flammable cladding. The material meant to keep out the wind and rain went up like a matchstick. The fire killed 72 people and left an entire community homeless and heartbroken. The ordeal sent Bichener into a panic. Was her building also at risk, she wondered?\n\nThe burned remains of Grenfell stood uncovered for months, looming over one of London\u2019s richest boroughs. It became a monument that to many symbolized the disastrous effects of austerity \u2013 the decade-long policy of cost-cutting embarked on by the Conservatives in response to the financial crisis of 2008. The tragedy was made all the more stark by its surroundings: the public housing block is just a five-minute walk from Kensington properties worth tens of millions of pounds. Look one way: scarcely imaginable wealth. The other: a hulking symbol of a broken and divided Britain.\n\nThe deadly blaze that engulfed the Grenfell Tower apartment building on June 14, 2017, was fueled by a type of cladding which is now banned. Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nIn the wake of the fire, there was a wave of promises from politicians that things would change \u2013 that building safety would be improved, social housing reformed, and that responsibility would be taken for the government agenda of public spending cuts, deregulation and privatization that acted as kindling for the tragedy that unfolded.\n\nBut in the five years since, Britons living in tower blocks with unsafe cladding have found themselves stuck in a perpetual state of limbo. CNN spoke with 10 people, who all say they are paralyzed by fear that their buildings could catch fire at any moment, and crippled by costs thrust upon them to fix safety defects that were not their fault \u2013 despite the government promising they would not have to \u201cpay a penny.\u201d\n\nNow, their problems are compounded by a fresh disaster: a spiraling cost-of-living crisis. As energy prices and inflation soar, residents like Bichener are facing an impossible situation, burdened not only by sky-high bills but also the eye-watering expense of remediating properties that now feel more like prisons than homes.\n\nResidents told CNN they were living in a perpetual state of anxiety, inundated by text alerts informing them of mounting bills and waiting on tenterhooks for the next buzz of their phone. Some said their building insurance had quadrupled since they moved in, while others were burdened by ballooning service charges \u2013 hundreds of pounds a month for safety fixes that hadn\u2019t been started.\n\nMany said they had left their mortgages on variable rates in the hopes they could eventually sell their apartments, but after the Bank of England hiked interest rates this fall their repayments had become untenable, with monthly payments almost doubling in some cases. Paired with the rising costs of living \u2013 more expensive energy, fuel and food \u2013 the residents CNN spoke with said they are finding themselves several thousand pounds a year poorer.\n\nWhen Bichener bought her flat in Vista Tower in Stevenage, a 16-story office block built in 1965 and converted into residential housing in 2016, there was \u201cno mention\u201d of fire hazards, she said. \u201cWhen Grenfell happened we spoke to our local council just to double-check all the buildings in the town. We asked the management agent and freeholder [the owner of the apartment building and land] if they have any concerns. At that point, everyone was saying no, all these buildings are good,\u201d Bichener told CNN.\n\nVista Tower, right, in Stevenage. Britons living in unsafe buildings remain haunted by the memory of Grenfell. Sophie Bichener\n\nBut there were soon signs of trouble. The developer that built the block put itself into liquidation \u2013 the first \u201cred flag,\u201d Bichener said. Emails to the freeholder went unanswered \u2013 the second. Then confirmation: In 2019, two years after Grenfell, the management agent reported that the building was unsafe. An inspection had found an array of hazards not previously listed.\n\nAfter the revelations, a group of former Grenfell residents came to visit Vista Tower to raise awareness about the nationwide cladding crisis. Bichener said that one man who had lost a family member in the Grenfell fire told her he was struck by the similarities: \u201cHe said he went cold.\u201d\n\nIn November 2020, she was hit with a life-changing bill from the freeholder. \u201cThe whole project, all of the remediation, came to about \u00a315 million.\u201d Split between the leaseholders, it worked out to be about \u00a3208,000 per flat.\n\nThat bill \u2013 almost the same price she initially paid for the flat \u2013 has hung over Bichener\u2019s head since. The government has offered little help and the political chaos in Britain has made matters worse. There have been seven housing secretaries in the five years since Grenfell, as the governing Conservative Party remains embroiled in internal strife. Some have begun to make progress \u2013 including threatening legal action to get the company that owns Vista Tower to pay up rather than passing the cost on to the residents \u2013 only to find themselves out of the job weeks later.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t afford to live in this building anymore. I don\u2019t want to pay the service charge, I don\u2019t want to pay all of the horrific leaseholder costs. I just don\u2019t want it. But I can\u2019t get out.\u201d Sophie Bichener\n\nMeanwhile, Bichener is still waiting for her life to get back on track. She is unable to sell, because banks are unwilling to lend against the property, and, in recent months, her mortgage, insurance and service charge have all shot up. The crippling costs meant she delayed getting married and has put off having children.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t afford to live in this building anymore. I don\u2019t want to pay the service charge, I don\u2019t want to pay all of the horrific leaseholder costs. I just don\u2019t want it. But I can\u2019t get out,\u201d Bichener, now 30 years old, said. \u201cI\u2019m trapped.\u201d\n\nAnd she\u2019s not alone. Hundreds of thousands of people are believed to be in the same boat, but the UK government has failed to commission a full audit, which means the scale of the impact is unclear. Peter Apps, deputy editor at Inside Housing, who has covered the story meticulously over the past five years, estimates there are likely more than 600,000 people in affected tall buildings and millions more in medium-rise towers \u2013 those between five and 10 stories. CNN has been unable to verify the precise number.\n\nThe fallout from Grenfell\n\nThe problems playing out now are the result of decades of poor policy choices, according to Apps. His new book detailing the Grenfell tragedy and subsequent inquiry, \u201cShow Me the Bodies,\u201d claims the UK \u201clet Grenfell happen\u201d through a combination of \u201cderegulation, corporate greed and institutional indifference.\u201d\n\nEvidence presented to the Grenfell Tower Inquiry found that the local council, which managed the building, had made a \u00a3300,000 ($389,400) saving by switching higher quality zinc cladding to a cheaper aluminum composite material (ACM). This meant for an additional \u00a32,300 ($3,000) per flat, the fire might have been prevented.\n\nAny regulations demanding developers use better quality materials were seen as being \u201canti-business,\u201d Apps told CNN. Developers did not even have to use qualified fire safety inspectors to carry out checks on their buildings \u2013 just individuals the developers themselves deemed to be \u201ccompetent.\u201d\n\nFive years on, the Grenfell victims' families are still waiting for answers -- and thousands are waiting for their buildings to be made safe. TOLGA AKMEN/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSo extensive was the deregulation that the problems were not confined just to high-rise tower blocks \u2013 or even to cladding. Instead, many low-rise buildings suffer from problems ranging from poor fire cavities to flammable insulation.\n\n\u201cThe cladding wasn\u2019t the issue at all,\u201d said Jennifer Frame, a 44-year-old travel industry analyst, who lived in Richmond House in south-west London. \u201cIt was the fact that it was a timber frame building, with a cavity between that and the cladding,\u201d she added, a safety defect that was confirmed by an inspection report.\n\nOne night in September 2019, a fire broke out in a flat in Richmond House. Rather than being contained in one room, the cavity acted \u201clike a chimney,\u201d Frame said. An independent report commissioned by the building owner, Metropolitan Thames Valley Housing Association, and included in written evidence submitted to the UK parliament by residents, revealed that the cavity barriers were either \u201cdefective\u201d or \u201centirely missing\u201d at Richmond House, allowing the fire to spread \u201calmost unhindered\u201d through the 23-flat block.\n\n\u201cThe use of materials such as ACM within cladding systems has rightly attracted a lot of attention since Grenfell. It is now clear that there is a much wider failure by construction companies,\u201d the residents said in their submission.\n\nCladding is meant to keep buildings dry and warm, but lax regulations have resulted in flammable materials being used in many cases. PAUL ELLIS/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSixty residents lost their homes that night. Three years later, Frame is still living in temporary accommodation in the same borough of London, while paying the mortgage for her property which no longer exists. Perversely, she said she feels lucky that it\u2019s only the mortgage \u2013 and not the monumental cost of remediations \u2013 that she\u2019s on the hook for.\n\n\u201cI do consider myself \u2013 for lack of a better word \u2013 one of the lucky ones, as we don\u2019t have the threat of bankruptcy hanging over our head any more,\u201d she said.\n\nCNN reached out for comment to the developer of Richmond House, Berkeley Group, but did not receive a reply. Berkeley Group has previously denied liability.\n\nCladding and cost-of-living crises collide\n\nYears of delay and disputes over who should cover the cost, combined with the sheer stress of living in unsafe buildings, have weighed heavily on residents.\n\nBichener moved back to her parents\u2019 house in 2020. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t face being there,\u201d she said. \u201cI ended up on anti-anxiety and anti-depression medication just from being in those four walls in a pandemic, in a dangerous home, with a life-changing sum of money that would potentially bankrupt me over my head.\u201d\n\nAt a rally for the End Our Cladding Scandal campaign, she recalled being with a group of people her age and how they all broke down in tears. \u201cThey\u2019re the only people who understand the situation you\u2019re in. Everyone\u2019s having huge crises over this.\u201d\n\nTheir options are limited. Most can\u2019t sell their properties, since banks won\u2019t offer mortgages against them. Even if banks were to reverse this policy, it is unclear whether there would be a demand for them, given the spiraling costs of borrowing. According to the residents CNN spoke with, a scant few have been able to sell to cash buyers \u2013 but often at a 60-80% loss.\n\nSome have become \u201cresentful landlords,\u201d a term used by residents who are unable to sell their properties, but are so desperate to move out that they rent it out cheaply to others. Lilli Houghton, 30, rents out her flat in Leeds, a city in the north of England, at a loss to a new tenant. She still pays the service charge for her flat, while also renting a new place elsewhere.\n\nMost have no choice but to wait \u2013 but five years has felt like an eternity. When Zoe Bartley, a 29-year-old lawyer, bought her one-bedroom apartment in Chelmsford, a city in Essex, she thought she\u2019d sell it within a few years to move into a family home.\n\nBut she hasn\u2019t been able to sell. She found a buyer in January 2020 \u2013 but their mortgage was declined after an inspection of the building found a number of fire safety defects.\n\nBartley\u2019s 15-month-old son still sleeps in her bedroom. When her two stepchildren come to stay, \u201cthey have to sleep in the living room,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen they were four and five and I\u2019d just started dating their dad,\u201d they were excited to have sleepovers in the living room. Now they\u2019re nine and 10, \u201cit\u2019s just pathetic,\u201d Bartley said.\n\nBartley said she struggles to sleep knowing that a fire could break out at night. Others who spoke to CNN say they have trained their children on what to do when the alarms go off.\n\nA waiting game\n\nEarlier this year, residents in unsafe buildings began to see some fledgling signs of progress. In a letter to developers, the then-housing secretary, Michael Gove, said it was \u201cneither fair nor decent that innocent leaseholders \u2026 should be landed with bills they cannot afford to fix problems they did not cause.\u201d He set out a plan to work with the industry to find a solution.\n\nFirst, he gave developers two months \u201cto agree to a plan of action to fund remediation costs,\u201d estimated at \u00a34 billion (around $5.4 billion). That deadline passed with no agreement reached.\n\nTo force developers\u2019 hands, the Building Safety Act was passed into law in April, which requires the fire safety defects in all buildings above 11 meters to be fixed and created a fund to help cover the costs. The act implemented a \u201cwaterfall\u201d system: Developers would be expected to pay first, but, if they are unable to, then the cost would fall to the building owners. If they are also unable to pay, only then would the cost fall to the leaseholders. Leaseholders\u2019 costs were capped at \u00a310,000 ($11,400), or \u00a315,000 ($17,000) in London, for those who met certain criteria. The government asked 53 companies to sign this pledge; many did.\n\nFor many residents, this came as a relief. They had faced life-changing bills for years, but the cap meant they wouldn\u2019t be totally wiped out. It seemed the worst of their worries were over.\n\nBut there was a problem: The pledge made by developers wasn\u2019t legally binding. Even though the government has made money available for remediation, no mechanism has yet forced any developers to make use of it.\n\nBichener still doesn't know when remediation work on Vista Tower will begin, how long it will take, or who will pay for it. Alamy\n\nOne resident explained to CNN: \u201cPrior to Michael Gove, your building owner could give you a bill to replace the cladding. They\u2019re now not able to do that anymore, but that doesn\u2019t mean your building gets fixed.\u201d\n\nThe government tried again. In July it published contracts to turn the \u201cpledge into legally binding undertakings.\u201d If developers signed the contract, this would commit them to remediating their buildings. Still, there was nothing obliging the developers to sign these contracts \u2013 and so none did.\n\nIn October, Vista Tower \u2013 where Bichener lives \u2013 came under scrutiny. Then-Housing Secretary Simon Clarke set a 21-day deadline for Grey GR, the owner of the building, to commit to fixing it. \u201cThe lives of over 100 people living in Vista Tower have been put on hold,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cEnough is enough.\u201d Bichener stressed her building was just one among thousands in need of remediation, but welcomed this as a \u201cstep in the right direction.\u201d\n\nBut when that deadline came, Clarke was already out of the job. He had been appointed by former UK Prime Minister Liz Truss, but after her six-week premiership came to an end, Clarke was replaced in the subsequent reshuffle. The deadline passed without Grey GR making any commitment.\n\nGove was reappointed by new Prime Minister Rishi Sunak as Clarke\u2019s successor in October. In response to questions from CNN, the UK\u2019s Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) confirmed that the government has started formal proceedings against Grey GR.\n\n\u201cWe are finalizing the legally binding contracts that developers will sign to fix their unsafe buildings, and expect them to do so very soon,\u201d a DLUHC spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n\u201cI think the \u2018who\u2019s paying\u2019 question will drag on for many years. That might be through court cases and tribunals. But I don\u2019t see how it will be resolved.\u201d Sophie Bichener\n\nGrey GR told CNN that it was \u201cabsolutely committed to carrying out the remediation works required,\u201d but that they had not started yet due to obstacles in receiving government funds.\n\n\u201cIssues with gaining access to [the Building Safety Fund], created by Government, have been, and remain, the fundamental roadblock to progress,\u201d Grey GR said in a statement, adding that the security of residents was of the \u201cutmost priority\u201d and that it was taking steps to make buildings safer.\n\nBut, according to Bichener, residents are no safer than they were five years ago. All that has changed is that, legally, they will no longer have to pay tens or hundreds of thousands of pounds to fix their buildings.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped building owners from seeking funds from residents though. \u201cThe amount of \u00a3208,430.04 is outstanding in connection with [your] property,\u201d read a letter sent to a resident of Vista Tower by the building owner in November. \u201cWe would appreciate your remittance within the next seven days.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, life for the residents of these buildings goes on. Since speaking to CNN, Bichener got married. She and her husband are both paying off their own mortgages until she is able to sell her flat. For years they had been \u201cstressed,\u201d she said, asking \u201cdo we tie ourselves together and have these two properties?\u201d But they decided they couldn\u2019t put their lives on pause forever because of her Vista Tower nightmare.\n\n\u201cI want to have left,\u201d Bichener said of where she wants to be, a year from now. \u201cThe dream is that I no longer own that property and I am long gone and I never have to see it or visit it again.\n\n\u201cBut if I\u2019m realistic, I think we\u2019ll be in the same situation. I think the \u2018who\u2019s paying\u2019 question will drag on for many years. That might be through court cases and tribunals. But I don\u2019t see how it will be resolved.\u201d", "label": "human"}

{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nHouse GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy still does not have enough vote commitments to be the next speaker following a nearly hour-long call with various factions of the Republican conference, and even as he has made a number of significant concessions in recent days.\n\nMcCarthy is racing the clock to try to lock down votes ahead of the House vote to elect a new speaker on Tuesday.\n\nThe call, which was described by multiple sources as collegial, focused on some of the same sticking points that have languished for weeks within GOP ranks. Republicans committed to continue working throughout the weekend to find a resolution, with lawmakers acknowledging there are still major issues to work through.\n\n\u201cRules are still in discussion. No concrete package to show at moment,\u201d one GOP lawmaker told CNN. \u201cBut if support is there, we may have some agreements.\u201d\n\nHouse Republicans have been debating whether to reinstate an arcane rule that would empower any member to bring up a vote to oust a sitting speaker at any time. For McCarthy\u2019s backers, the so-called motion to vacate the speaker\u2019s chair is seen as something that could be used by the right flank to hamstring his ability to lead the conference and effectively govern.\n\nIn one separate breakthrough, however, McCarthy did say he was open to moving forward with a committee that would investigate federal government activity and look into political partisanship at agencies, such as the FBI and the Justice Department.\n\nWhat form that committee takes is still unclear, but it has been a top ask from conservatives such as Rep. Chip Roy of Texas. This would centralize the myriad probes into the Biden administration into a single panel, but the idea could run into resistance from the soon-to-be committee chairs, who have already begun work on the House GOP\u2019s planned investigations.\n\nAnother concern is over whether the various concessions will even deliver enough votes to make McCarthy the speaker. In a positive sign for McCarthy, another GOP lawmaker did say that some Republicans, who previously considered themselves on the fence, announced on Friday\u2019s call that they are now leaning toward McCarthy based on the ongoing negotiations.\n\nOne previously undecided lawmaker, Rep. Morgan Griffith of Virginia, announced in a statement Friday evening that he would support McCarthy.\n\nGriffith, a senior member of the hardline House Freedom Caucus who was on the Friday call, said McCarthy has agreed to \u201ca rule that legislation will only have a single purpose\u201d as well as another change that would require \u201ca stricter germaneness rule.\u201d\n\n\u201cA single bill should not be a hodgepodge of issues totaling thousands of pages,\u201d Griffith said in the statement. \u201cI believe these changes can dramatically improve our legislative process. Because Leader McCarthy agreed to these rules changes, I have agreed to vote for him for Speaker of the House.\u201d\n\nOn the motion to vacate, McCarthy has expressed an openness to lowering the threshold down to five members, which is something members of the Freedom Caucus are pushing for. But one source told CNN that there was \u201cdeep hesitancy\u201d from other members who fear that lowering the threshold could hold the conference hostage in the months to come.\n\nThe source told CNN there was \u201ca lot of frustration over opening this back up.\u201d\n\nSome House Republicans have pressed for a process that would allow any single member to hold a floor vote on ousting the sitting speaker, which was wielded over former Speaker John Boehner before he was forced out of the job by the far right in 2015.\n\nMcCarthy has been adamantly opposed to restoring the \u201cmotion to vacate the chair,\u201d and a majority of the House GOP voted against the idea during a closed-door meeting in November.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control (BAFA) announced today that the gas storage capacity in Germany has increased. The value in November 2020 was 90.76%, an increase of over 1% compared to the previous month.\n\nAccording to the BAFA, the current increase in gas stocks is mainly due to the reduced gas consumption. The cold weather in December and January has contributed to reduced gas consumption, and the weak rainfall in recent weeks has also reduced the share of drinking water in the gas storage tanks, leading to an increase in overall capacity.\n\nThe increasing gas storage capacity is an important sign that Germany is on the path to a more sustainable energy supply. Since the beginning of 2020, the federal government has made great efforts to increase the share of renewable energies in the power mix and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. With the goal of increasing the share of renewable energies in power generation to 65% by 2030, the federal government has significantly expanded public support for renewable energies.\n\nThe increase in gas storage capacity is an important step towards a more sustainable energy supply in Germany. The increase in gas capacity offers the German industry more flexibility in choosing energy sources and allows companies to respond faster to changing market conditions.\n\nCurrently, more than 20 companies are involved in the gas storage market in Germany. Each company stores a portion of foreign gases that enter the country across borders. The gases are stored in massive underground tanks. The costs for building and operating these tanks are borne by the companies.\n\nThe increase in gas storage capacity in Germany is also a good sign for the development of the German gas network. As the storage capacity increases, so will the demand for gas in the future, which will require investments in the expansion of the network. In this way, Germany can ensure a secure and stable supply of gas.\n\nThe increase in gas storage capacity is a positive signal for the German energy industry. The increase in storage capacity shows that the country is on the right track to modernize its energy supply and shape it in a sustainable way. In the coming months and years, the federal government will need to strengthen its efforts to reduce dependence on fossil fuels to achieve this goal.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "U.S. Senator Richard Burr (R-NC), ranking member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, gives opening remarks at the confirmation hearing for Xavier Becerra, U.S. President Joe Biden's nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services, at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, February 23, 2021.\n\nMembers of Congress are barred by law from using nonpublic information that they obtain through their official positions to profit from stock trades.\n\nThe SEC previously said in court filings that the agency was \"investigating whether [Burr] sold stocks on the basis of nonpublic information.\"\n\nBurr retired from the Senate on Tuesday after three terms. He had said before his 2016 reelection that he would not seek a fourth term if he won that year.\n\nThe stock sales occurred, a week before equities markets in the U.S. and elsewhere plunged as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic , and after Burr had received briefings about the threat of the pandemic. Burr and Fauth had a very short phone call on the same day as the stock sales, the SEC has said in court filings.\n\nThe SEC, which did not deny the attorneys' statements, was eying Burr, a Republican, and his brother-in-law Gerald Fauth , who sits on a federal board , in a civil probe for their stock sales on the same day in February 2020.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has ended its insider trading investigation of former U.S. Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina and his brother-in-law without taking action against either man, their lawyers said Friday.\n\nThe Department of Justice earlier had closed a criminal investigation of Burr and Fauth without taking action against either man.\n\nAs part of that criminal probe, Burr had his cellphone seized by the FBI in May 2020, which led to him stepping aside as chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\nBurr, in a statement provided to CNBC on Friday, said, \"This week, the SEC informed me that they have concluded their investigation with no action.\"\n\n\"I am glad to have this matter in the rearview mirror as I begin my retirement from the Senate following nearly three decades of public service,\" Burr said.\n\nIn her own statement, his attorney Alice Fisher said, \"We have believed all along that this is the right result.\"\n\nBurr \"is glad to put this matter behind him as he embarks on his retirement from his dedicated service in the Senate,\" Fisher said.\n\nIn a statement, Fauth's lawyer, F. Joseph Warin, said, \"The SEC has closed its investigation into our client. \"\n\n\"We are thrilled that the SEC and the DOJ appropriately closed their investigations without any findings of insider trading,\" Warin said. \"Mr. Fauth looks forward to continuing his public service and leadership in the transportation industry.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the SEC, in an email to CNBC, said, \"As a matter of policy, the SEC does not comment on the opening or closing of a possible investigation.\"\n\nBurr, like other senators, had been briefed by federal health officials in early 2020 about the coronavirus before it began spreading widely in the U.S., leading to nationwide lockdowns and decreases in business activities.\n\nAt the time, Burr, due to his membership on the intelligence committee, had access to classified intelligence reports that contained dire warnings about the pandemic.\n\nFauth, who is the brother of Burr's wife, is a member and former chairman of the National Mediation Board, an agency that facilitates labor-management relations in the U.S. railroad and airline industries.\n\nThe SEC in court filings has said that on Feb. 13, 2020, Burr called his stockbroker and directed him to sell more than $1.65 million worth of stock. The holdings accounted for \"all but one of the equities in his and his wife's joint individual retirement account ... portfolio.\"\n\nAlmost three hours later, Burr called Fauth's cellphone for a call that lasted 50 seconds, the SEC has said.\n\nA minute or less after that, Fauth called his primary stockbroker, who did not answer, the SEC has said in a filing. Fauth then called a second broker within two minutes and \"directed her to sell several stocks in his wife's account,\" the filing reveals.\n\nThat broker sold between $97,000 and $280,000 worth of Fauth's shares in six companies, several of which ended up having their stocks plummet in the following weeks, the filing indicates.\n\nAfter Burr's stock sales came to light in March 2020, he said, \"I relied solely on public news reports to guide my decision regarding the sale of stocks.\"\n\n\"Specifically, I closely followed CNBC's daily health and science reporting out of its Asia bureaus at the time,\" Burr said at that time.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "A sudden and unexpected development has taken place at Disney, leaving its executive leadership team in a state of surprise and uncertainty. According to sources, the company has reached out to its former CEO, Bob Iger, to take over the reins once again, a move that has left CEO Bob Chapek feeling blindsided. The decision has sparked questions about Chapek's future at the company, with some speculating that this may be the end of his tenure.\n\nThe news broke late Friday night, with Bloomberg reporting that Disney had asked Iger to return as CEO, just six months after he stepped down as chairman and CEO. Disney later confirmed the decision, stating that Iger had been asked to take over and Chapek had accepted the decision. However, sources close to the matter revealed that Chapek was not given prior notice of the decision and was left feeling blindsided.\n\nThe reasons behind the sudden decision are unclear, but it's likely that Iger's return is intended to help with the ongoing integration process of Disney's recent acquisition of 21st Century Fox. Iger, who took over as CEO in 2005 and stepped down earlier this year, has stayed involved with the company as executive chairman. His return could be seen as a sign of a lack of confidence in the current executive team, or it could be a move to bring back a leader who is familiar with the company's inner workings.\n\nThe decision has caused a stir within the executive team at Disney, with some welcoming the move and others questioning the company's faith in its current leadership. Whatever the case, Iger's return as CEO is likely to be a significant shakeup for the company, and it remains to be seen how Chapek and the rest of the leadership will adapt to this new development.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Burned by layoffs, tech workers are rethinking risk 'Not everybody is walking away with a year\u2019s worth of runway in their pocket'\n\nTech isn\u2019t as collegial as it used to be. Rocket ships are being unveiled as sputtering messes, mission-driven startups don\u2019t feel so mission-oriented when responding to investor pressure, and widespread layoffs offer a loud reminder that jobs are breakable contracts, not sacrosanct vows.\n\nOver the past few months, thousands of employees from Meta, Twitter, Stripe, Amazon, DoorDash and countless other companies that don\u2019t have the privilege of being household names are back on the job market. A job market that includes hiring freezes, salary cuts and a general malaise that industry experts warn won\u2019t be over this year.\n\nSo where does tech\u2019s talent go from here?\n\nThe answer is complicated, and it\u2019s too early to have definitive labor data. VCs want to fund the newest tech mafia startups before banks do, top MBA programs want laid off workers to join so badly that they\u2019re waiving standardized test score requirements, and the tech companies that are in a position to hire really want you to know it.\n\nTechCrunch spoke to laid-off employees about how they\u2019re approaching their careers differently in 2023. Pseudonyms have been used in cases where names are included to protect current and future employment prospects, per the requests of the individuals quoted. The common thread between all the answers includes a reframing of how \u201csafe\u201d it is to work in tech, and, perhaps more importantly, what it takes to jump back into the sector after getting burned.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m taking my control back\u2019\n\nAaliyah was laid off from her tech job in the spring. Just one month earlier, she had a positive review with her boss and was promised a raise with more stock options.\n\nThe layoff thus came as a surprise. And unlike some of her colleagues, who put their names in spreadsheets and jumped back into the job hunt, Aaliyah took a few weeks to think. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to stay in tech, I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to work for anyone,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI had to make a decision in terms of what I want my day-to-day life to look like financially; am I going to hustle or do I just want to take what falls into my lap?\u201d she said on the phone. \u201cAfter a couple of weeks, I felt like I\u2019m ready to take more control back as opposed to just letting people kind of sway me one way or another.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Aaliyah works two full-time tech jobs \u2013 neither company knows \u2013 and she runs a consultancy business on the side. While many people work multiple jobs to make ends meet, the opportunity to work multiple full-time jobs in tech has been amplified by remote work and layoffs. In fact, over 39,000 people are in the \u201cOveremployed\u201d Discord community, which is self-described \u201cas a community of professionals looking to work two remote jobs, earn extra income, and achieve financial freedom. Be free from office politics and layoffs.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever again am I going to put myself into a position where I\u2019m dependent on one stream of income from one company that may or may not do what\u2019s in my interest,\u201d Aaliyah said. \u201cThey\u2019re gonna do what they want, and I\u2019m going to do what\u2019s mine.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also a hedge against the bias she says she faces as a Black woman in tech.\n\n\u201cAs a Black woman, sometimes I feel slighted by being overlooked and not feeling like anyone thinks I\u2019m capable of doing more,\u201d she said. \u201cSo you may not have thought that I was capable of doing a lot more but I actually do \u2013 and you don\u2019t know what\u2019s in my bank account.\u201d\n\nSome see over-employment as their next step, while others are still reflecting on how their job title evolves in this new environment.\n\nThe two-time second hire\n\nSam has noticed an odd pattern in his work. He\u2019s been the second finance hire, twice, by two venture-backed startups. And he\u2019s been laid off by both of those companies over the past year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been odd, because I chose accounting and finance as my major back in undergrad 15 years ago because I was told it was the backbone of business, that they needed it in order for a business to function,\u201d Sam said. He turned to mentors in the space, and says that \u201ctheir first reaction is that typically finance isn\u2019t a function that is affected in these layoffs.\u201d While the tech worker says that \u201caccounting is an afterthought in tech,\u201d the reality is a bit more complicated.\n\nWhile it seems that every other chief executive attributes \u201ca need to be more disciplined\u201d as a reason for conducting company-wide layoffs, even a strong financial runway isn\u2019t enough to keep people hired. In Sam\u2019s case, he was first let go by a Series B software-as-a-service product after a funding round fell through, so he began looking for new jobs that promised more financial stability. He eventually began interviewing with a number of companies, and ended up choosing an ed-tech marketplace that had promised they had a large cash position from a recent fundraising spree. Then, when that company laid him off, he realized that good books aren\u2019t enough to justify job stability.\n\nToday, Sam is doing part-time work, which he set up when he began hearing rumors of the second round of layoffs, and interviewing for full-time gigs. There\u2019s a clash between what he wants, which is a stable, reliable job, and what he naturally cares about as someone who has spent time working in scrappy startups on small teams.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a dilemma I have right now, where I\u2019m going through every process with a company that is much healthier on their bottom line, they have 401(K) match\u2026. if an offer ever does come from [those] companies, can I bring myself around enough to be interested? It\u2019s hard to know what you care about.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s still frustrated over losing his job at the edtech company.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re out here building an edtech marketplace. And here I am, with all of the experience and skills and knowledge to help the company do that and I won\u2019t be able to see that through,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like it\u2019s their missed opportunity. That\u2019s what I still like struggle with.\u201d\n\n\u2018Not everybody is walking away with a year\u2019s worth of runway in their pockets\u2019\n\nNot long before Mary was fired from an HR tech company, she was given an award that recognized her contributions to the team. The trophy was still being engraved with her name when she got the call, just weeks later, that her job had been terminated due to the macroeconomic climate.\n\nEven worse, it was the second time this company laid her off. The first time, Mary reflects, was in March 2020 when \u201cthe world was falling apart.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like corporate irresponsibility or anything, it was just like, everything is on fire and we\u2019re so sorry,\u201d she said \u201cThen a few months later, they called me back, saying that things are not as bad as we thought.\u201d Because the job market was tough \u2013 and she didn\u2019t sense any poor management issues \u2013 she rejoined, got a small raise, her equity was reinstated, and so the job continued for the next two years, until she was laid off again this summer.\n\nMary went back on the job hunt again, this time ending up at a venture-backed early-stage startup. Then, a few weeks into the job, she got laid off. This time, it stung even more \u2013 because this was the first job where she earned a six-figure salary since joining the tech world years ago.\n\n\u201cI had just broken six figures and I had that for only five weeks,\u201d Mary said. \u201cI was really excited to max out my 401(k) and now I\u2019m thinking I should have kept that extra two grand in cash.\u201d Right now, she has five weeks of pay, one month of Cobra healthcare insurance, and plans to sign up for Medicaid.\n\n\u201cNot everybody is walking away with a year\u2019s worth of runway in their pocket,\u201dMary said. \u201cWhen people had really high salaries and enjoyed really high salaries for the majority of their career \u2013 they assume other people have personal savings to guard against this[\u2026] but life is really expensive.\u201d\n\nDespite being burned, Mary isn\u2019t leaving the tech world because she\u2019s inspired by \u201cthe incredibly bright, talented, capable people who are just trying to build something.\u201d This year, she plans to ask her network for help with the job hunt, adding that no one is looking at cold job applications while Stripe and Twitter talent is getting laid off.\n\nShe plans to be direct. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of how profitable is enough?\u201d she said, at one point during the interview. \u201cWhen is it enough to sustain your workforce \u2013 what math is happening here?\u201d\n\nBut she also is aware that, ultimately, what happened to her over the past twelve months may happen again.\n\n\u201cYou can ask all the right questions, you can do all the research, you can ask about burn and runway and all these things \u2013 and even if they say all the right things, if something changes in the market, there\u2019s just very little power that you have as an individual,\u201d she said. \u201cOther than to, you know, save as much as you possibly can for a rainy day.\u201d", "label": "human"}

{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nRep.-elect George Santos made additional false claims over the years about his family history, work history and education in campaign appearances over the years, a review of statements made in two of his campaigns for Congress found.\n\nCNN\u2019s KFile uncovered more falsehoods from Santos, including claims he was forced to leave a New York City private school when his family\u2019s real estate assets took a downturn and stating he represented Goldman Sachs at a top financial conference where he berated the company for investing in renewables.\n\nCNN also reviewed more instances of Santos providing additional false history of his family\u2019s background. In one interview, Santos said his mother\u2019s family\u2019s historical Jewish name was \u201cZabrovsky,\u201d and later appeared to operate a GoFundMe campaign for a pet charity (which he falsely claimed was a 501(c)(3) nonprofit) under that alias. Genealogists CNN previously spoke with found no evidence of Jewish or Ukrainian heritage in his family tree.\n\nIn another, he said his mother, whose family has lived in Brazil since the late 1800s, was a White immigrant from Belgium.\n\nSantos\u2019 campaign did not respond to CNN\u2019s comment request.\n\nSince reports first surfaced about his false claims, Santos has made efforts to downplay his fabrications as mere \u201cembellishments.\u201d But the previously unreported claims from Santos illustrate a pattern of fabricating details about his life, often in service of presenting a more compelling or interesting personal narrative. The Nassau County district attorney\u2019s office said Wednesday that it is looking into Santos\u2019 fabrications, though it did not specify the falsehoods it would explore.\n\nIn interviews over the past few days, Santos admitted to lying about parts of his resume, including graduating from college, but he told the New York Post that the misrepresentation of his work history at Goldman Sachs and Citigroup was a \u201cpoor choice of words.\u201d There is no record he worked at the top financial institutions in the country, as he had previously claimed.\n\nSantos also denied that he falsely called himself Jewish, claiming he \u201cnever claimed to be Jewish\u201d but jokingly said he was \u201cJew-ish\u201d to the New York Post. He also falsely claimed that his grandparents \u201csurvived the Holocaust\u201d and fled Europe to escape Jewish persecution. But CNN found that Santos called himself an \u201cAmerican Jew\u201d and \u201cLatino Jew\u201d on multiple occasions. The Republican Jewish Coalition disinvited Santos from appearing at any of its events because he \u201cmisrepresented his heritage.\u201d\n\nDespite the scandals, the New York Republican, who flipped his Long Island seat, said he will take office in January \u2014 spurring calls to resign from Democrats.\n\nHere are some of the outright falsehoods CNN found:\n\nWent to fancy prep school, but left because his family\u2019s real estate imploded\n\nIn appearances, and in an old campaign biography, Santos claimed his parents sent him to Horace Mann, an elite private school in the Bronx.\n\n\u201cHe began Horace Mann preparatory school in the Bronx, however, did not graduate from Horace Mann due to financial difficulties for his family,\u201d his biography read in 2019 for his first campaign for Congress that Santos lost. \u201cHe obtained a GED during his senior year.\u201d\n\nSantos also made the same claim in an appearance on a YouTube show in 2020.\n\n\u201cThey sent me to a good prep school, which was Horace Mann Prep in the Bronx. And, in my senior year of prep school, unfortunately my parents fell on hard times, which was something that would later become known as the depression of 2008. But we were hit a little earlier on with the overleveraging of real estate. And the market started to implode. Um, and the first thing to go was the prep school. You know, you, you can\u2019t afford a $2,500 tuition at that point, right? So anyway, um, I left school, uh, four months to graduation.\u201d\n\nBut the claim is false, according to the school.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve searched the records and there is no evidence that George Santos (or any alias) attended Horace Mann,\u201d Ed Adler, a spokesman for the school, told CNN.\n\nClaimed he criticized Goldman Sachs at private equity conference as an employee\n\n\u201cHave you ever heard of a Goldman Sachs employee take the stage at the largest private equity conference in the world \u2013 SALT, run by Anthony Scaramucci \u2013 and berate their employer? Well, I did that,\u201d Santos said on a local podcast this summer. \u201cAnd I did it in the fashion of renewable energy and global warming. This was the panel I was on. And they\u2019re all talking about solar, wind, and this was back, what, seven years ago now? And I said, you know what, this is a scam. It\u2019s taxpayer money that gets subsidized.\u201d\n\nThe claim is entirely fictional, according to both Goldman Sachs \u2013 which has said Santos never worked there \u2013 and Scaramucci, who runs the conference.\n\nScaramucci told CNN in a message there is not only no record of him appearing on a panel, but no record of him even attending the conference.\n\nClaimed family\u2019s Jewish name was Zabrovsky (and fundraised under it)\n\nIn an appearance on a Fox News digital show in February, Santos said his maternal grandparents changed their Jewish last name from Zabrovsky \u2013 a claim for which there is no evidence and records contradict.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t carry the Ukrainian last name. For a lot of people who are descendants of World War II refugees or survivors of the Holocaust, a lot of names and paperwork were changed in the name of survival. So I don\u2019t carry the family last name that would\u2019ve been Zabrovsky. I carry my mother\u2019s maiden name which is the Dutch side of the family.\u201d\n\nMegan Smolenyak, an author and professional genealogist who helped research Santos\u2019 family tree at CNN\u2019s request, previously told CNN, \u201cThere\u2019s no sign of Jewish and/or Ukrainian heritage and no indication of name changes along the way.\u201d\n\nSantos deleted his former private Facebook account last week, but CNN\u2019s KFile reviewed records indicating he used the alias of \u201cAnthony Zabrovsky\u201d for fundraising for a pet charity. The GoFundMe page under that alias no longer exists. CNN reached out to GoFundMe but did not receive a response.\n\nSantos claimed his mom immigrated from Belgium\n\nIn one radio appearance from December 2020, Santos falsely claimed that his mother \u201cfled socialism\u201d in Europe and moved to the United States.\n\n\u201cMy father fled socialism in Brazil. My mother fled socialism in Europe, and they came here and built a family. And today they can be proud to have a son who is a well accomplished businessman, who is now running for United States Congress. That\u2019s something that wasn\u2019t in the cards for my family,\u201d Santos said.\n\nHe also claimed in another interview from 2020 that he \u201cgrew up with a White Caucasian mother, an immigrant from Belgium.\u201d\n\nBut Santos\u2019 mother was born in Brazil, according to genealogical records.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "California's regions already experiencing flooding may face further challenges as a new storm is forecasted to hit the state. This will be the third \"moisture-laden atmospheric flow\" to affect the state in the past week, with the potential to be the most potent of all.\n\nAtmospheric flows are long, narrow channels of moisture that can stretch for thousands of miles and carry massive amounts of water in the form of snow or rain. It's not uncommon for them to move through California, but the sheer volume of rain they can produce in a short period is often remarkable.\n\nThe first flow hit California late on Saturday night and continued throughout Sunday. This event brought heavy precipitation to many parts of the state, with some areas receiving more than 10 inches of rain. This flow also generated significant coastal waves, resulting in beach erosion and damage to coastal structures.\n\nThe second atmospheric flow struck California on Monday. This event also produced heavy precipitation and flash flooding in certain areas, although not to the same extent as the first flow. However, the rain from this second flow was sufficient to exacerbate flooding in already-saturated regions.\n\nNow, the National Weather Service is warning of a third storm on the way. Forecasters predict that this storm could be the most powerful of the three, with some areas potentially receiving up to 10 inches of rain or more. This storm is expected to hit late Wednesday night or early Thursday morning and continue through Friday.\n\nThe weather service is urging residents living in areas prone to flooding to prepare for the worst. It's recommended that residents in such areas ensure they have supplies of food, water, and medicine on hand in case they need to evacuate their homes. Residents should also verify they have access to shelters or safe locations in the event of a flood.\n\nThe weather service is also cautioning drivers to exercise extreme caution when traveling through areas prone to flooding. They are reminding drivers never to drive through flooded roads, as they can be hazardous and lead to significant damage.\n\nThe California Office of Emergency Services is advising residents to take precautions before, during, and after the third atmospheric flow hits. They are urging residents to secure any loose items on their property, such as furniture or planters, as these items can easily be blown away or become damaged in strong winds. Residents should also ensure they have access to necessary supplies and medications, as well as be prepared for any potential flooding.\n\nThe state's emergency services department is asking residents to monitor local weather forecasts and warnings, and be ready to take action if necessary. They are reminding residents to be aware of their surroundings during a storm and be prepared to move to a safe location if necessary.\n\nIt's clear that California's flooded areas are in for a challenging week ahead. The third atmospheric flow could bring even more hardship and destruction to areas already reeling from the impact of the first two flows. With the state in a state of emergency, it's essential for residents to be aware of the potential dangers and take the necessary precautions.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Tensions escalated globally on Sunday as a prominent Israeli right-wing figure, Moshe Feiglin, visited the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in occupied East Jerusalem.\n\nFeiglin's visit, also known as the Temple Mount, marked the first time an Israeli right-wing leader has visited the sacred site in a decade. The event sparked widespread condemnation from Palestinians and their allies, who accused Feiglin of attempting to undermine their religious and political claims to the site.\n\n\"It is a profound affront to the spiritual beliefs of Palestinian Muslims and a perilous provocation,\" stated Saeb Erekat, a chief Palestinian negotiator. \"It is a flagrant disregard for the sanctity of the holy sites, and an act of incitement that could result in further destabilization of the region.\"\n\nThe Palestinian Authority demanded an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council to address the matter.\n\n\"We urge the U.N. Security Council to take swift and decisive action to halt this threat to international peace and security,\" said Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in a statement.\n\nIsrael's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, condemned Feiglin's visit and vowed to take measures against the right-wing leader.\n\n\"Feiglin's actions are in breach of Israel's longstanding policy, and I will take the necessary steps to ensure that such provocative behavior does not recur,\" Netanyahu said in a statement.\n\nThe visit sparked violent clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli security forces. At least 10 Palestinians were injured, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent. Israeli police reported several Israeli officers were also injured in the clashes.\n\nThe Al-Aqsa compound, which is home to the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque, is considered the third holiest site in Islam. The site also holds spiritual significance to Jews, as it is believed to have once been the site of two ancient Jewish temples.\n\nThe visit by Feiglin, affiliated with the Jewish extremist political party Yisrael Beiteinu, was seen by many Palestinians as an attempt to challenge their religious and political claims to the site.\n\n\"This visit is an act of desecration and incitement,\" stated Sheikh Raed Salah, the leader of the Islamic Movement in Israel. \"The prime minister of Israel must take a firm and decisive stance to prevent any recurrence of such provocations.\"\n\nArab and Islamic leaders from across the region also denounced Feiglin's visit, calling it a \"dangerous provocation\" and a \"blatant violation of the sanctity of the holy sites.\"\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan stated he would take \"all necessary measures to protect the Islamic character of Jerusalem and its holy sites.\"\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Feiglin's visit was \"a grave breach of international law and an insult to the collective sentiments of Muslims everywhere.\"\n\nThe incident also sparked a wave of protests across the Arab and Muslim world. Demonstrators in Jordan, Turkey, Iran, and other countries took to the streets to condemn Feiglin's visit and call for an end to the Israeli occupation of East Jerusalem.\n\nFor its part, Israel has long maintained that the holy sites of all religions should be respected. Netanyahu has pledged to continue to respect the status quo at the Al-Aqsa compound, and that no further steps will be taken to change the status of the holy sites.\n\nHowever, many Palestinians remain concerned about Israeli encroachment on the site and view Feiglin's visit as a deliberate provocation.\n\n\"We will continue to work towards ensuring that Al-Aqsa is respected and preserved as a sacred site of worship for Muslims,\" said Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah in a statement. \"We call on the international community to show solidarity with the Palestinian people in the face of these provocations, and to help us protect our holy sites and our rights.\"", "label": "machine"}

According to sources, the company has already initiated the process of releasing hundreds of employees, with more announcements anticipated in the coming weeks.\n\nThe news coincides with a period of significant leadership upheaval at Salesforce, which recently announced the departure of co-CEO Keith Block and the appointment of a new CEO, Bret Taylor. Other high-profile departures include head of product Jeremy Stanley and head of cloud operations Scott Davis.\n\n\"The executive exodus at Salesforce is part of a broader trend of companies adopting more agile and flat organizational structures, reducing their reliance on traditional corporate hierarchies,\" said Madeline MacCready, an analyst at Forrester Research. \"It's evident that Salesforce is seeking to streamline its operations and reduce costs in the face of increased competition and challenging market conditions.\"\n\nThe cuts come as Salesforce attempts to reduce costs and invest more heavily in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and cloud computing. The company has made several significant investments in the AI space over the past year, including its acquisition of Twilio, a cloud-based communications platform.\n\nIn addition to the leadership shake-up, the tech giant has reportedly shifted its focus towards mobile development, seeking to expand its market share in the enterprise software market. Salesforce recently released an open-source platform called \"Lightning\" that makes it easier for developers to create apps that run on mobile phones.\n\n\"It's clear that Salesforce is looking to invest heavily in mobile development, in order to keep pace with the evolving landscape of enterprise software,\" said MacCready. \"As businesses worldwide become increasingly mobile, Salesforce needs to adapt to the changing times to remain competitive.\"\n\nDespite the news of layoffs and executive departures, Salesforce remains a major player in the enterprise software market. The company recently reported its highest-ever quarterly earnings and continues to dominate the customer-relationship-management software market.\n\nThe news of layoffs and reorganization is likely to cause uncertainty among Salesforce employees, but analysts remain optimistic that the company will continue to be a major force in the enterprise software market.\n\n\"Salesforce is clearly in a period of transition, but the company is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for enterprise software,\" said MacCready. \"The company remains a leader in customer relationship management, and its investments in mobile development and artificial intelligence should enable it to stay ahead of the competition in the years to come.\"", "label": "machine"}

And the messaging was terrible: the layoffs were leaked beforehand, yet they didn\u2019t make it public that high performers also lost their jobs.\u201d\n\nSingh\u2019s frustrations were compounded by the fact that he believed his job was relatively safe, especially since he\u2019d never been informed of any performance problem. Plus, as an Indian expatriate on a US work visa, he had just 60 days to find a new role.\n\nAs thousands of colleagues began posting about their layoffs on LinkedIn, Singh followed suit. But despite his consternation at losing his job, and the dread of possibly having to leave the country as a result, the tone of his short message was upbeat and magnanimous. He wrote that although his journey ended prematurely, he agreed with his other colleagues who were gushing on social media that his now-former employer offered \u201ceverything\u201d anyone could want from a workplace. After thanking his ex-teammates, he concluded the post with a line that he was available for work, alongside a picture of his work ID badge.\n\nSingh sounded anything but bitter about the situation \u2013 exactly what he\u2019d intended. \u201cI worked for a social-media company: I know what you post lasts forever,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no upside in writing anything negative about anyone.\u201d\n\nSingh\u2019s LinkedIn post was met with supportive comments from former colleagues who were writing similarly praiseful posts, and his message was seen, sent and shared among recruiters who contacted him about vacancies. \u201cI received my layoff letter at 0600,\u201d he says. \u201cBy 0700, I\u2019d updated my LinkedIn status.

While these messages may contain genuine sentiments, of course, they can also be performative and strategic: serving an important function in displaying a worker\u2019s employability and adaptability.\n\nA strategic move\n\nAfter an initial wave of layoffs at the beginning of the pandemic, many companies rushed to hire new workers, rapidly expanding their teams.\n\nRecently, however, a market slowdown has caused firms to pause recruitment, particularly in technology, where several start-ups and high-growth companies have implemented hiring freezes and, in some cases, even rescinded job offers. In late 2022, some companies also turned to layoffs. Among these were a swath of high-profile cut sat Big Tech firms as well as sectors including finance, retail and media.

{"text": "This image provided by WJLA shows migrant families as they get on to a bus to transport them from near the Vice President's residence to an area church after they arrived in Washington, Saturday, Dec. 24, 2022. Local organizers in Washington say three buses of recent migrant families arrived from Texas near the home in record-setting cold on Christmas Eve. Texas authorities have not confirmed their involvement.\n\nThree buses of recent migrant families arrived from Texas near the home of Vice President Kamala Harris in the record-setting cold on Christmas Eve.\n\nTexas authorities have not confirmed their involvement, but the bus dropoffs are in line with previous actions by border-state governors calling attention to the Biden administration's immigration policies.\n\nThe buses that arrived late Saturday outside the vice president's residence were carrying around 110 to 130 people, according to Tatiana Laborde, managing director of SAMU First Response, a relief agency working with the city of Washington to serve thousands of migrants who have been dropped off in recent months.\n\nLocal organizers had expected the buses to arrive Sunday but found out Saturday that the group would get to Washington early, Laborde said. The people on board included young children.\n\nSome were wearing T-shirts despite temperatures hovering around 15 degrees Fahrenheit (-9 degrees Celsius). It was the coldest Christmas Eve on record for Washington, according to the Washington Post.\n\nLaborde said employees had blankets ready for the people who arrived on Christmas Eve and moved them quickly onto waiting buses for a ride to an area church. A local restaurant chain donated dinner and breakfast.\n\nMost of the arrivals were headed to other destinations and expected to remain in Washington only briefly.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott's office did not respond to a request for comment Sunday morning. His office said last week that Texas has given bus rides to more than 15,000 people since April to Washington, New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia.\n\nAbbott and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, both Republicans, are strong critics of President Joe Biden on his handling of the U.S.-Mexico border, where thousands of people are trying to cross daily, many to seek asylum. Officials on both sides of the border are seeking emergency help in setting up shelters and services for migrants, some of whom are sleeping on the streets.\n\nRepublicans argue Biden and Harris, designated the administration's point person on the root causes of migration, have relaxed restrictions that induced many people to leave their countries of origin. Biden has ended some policies but kept others enacted by former President Donald Trump, whose administration also grappled with spikes in border crossings and at one point separated immigrant families and children as a deterrence initiative.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "In stadium parking lots all across America, people are now gathering to support their favorite football teams, raising the art of tailgating to a sport unto itself\u2014all in a friendly competition to throw the biggest and best shindig before the big game.\n\nAnd what\u2019s a party without great sound? Here\u2019s a selection of wireless and Bluetooth speakers that can fill the great outdoors with music, your team\u2019s pregame show, or even the dulcet baritone of NFL Films legend John Facenda.\n\nSEE ALL Consumer Reports product reviews\n\nTailgate speakers tend to be bulky and heavy, so they might not be ideal for a leisurely stroll about town. But with audio, size often equals superior sound quality.\n\n\"All the speakers in this roundup featured admirable sound quality, and that should be enough to earn them a place in your home after the game,\" says Elias Arias, the head of CR\u2019s wireless speaker testing program.\n\nThese standout speakers have been tested in Consumer Reports dedicated sound lab. Our trained experts evaluated them for ease of use, versatility, and most of all, sound quality. As with all products, every test speaker was purchased anonymously from a retail source. And, of course, we never accept freebies from manufacturers.\n\nThe Boom Box Rebooted\n\nThe JBL Boombox 2 represents a slight upgrade to the original Boombox, which was a digital re-imagining of the giant beat boxes the cool kids\u2014and even LL Cool J\u2014carried around in the 1980s and 90s. But while those behemoths ate D-cell batteries the way competitive eaters down Nathan\u2019s hot dogs, the Boombox 2\u2019s rechargeable battery is good for 24 hours of music, according to JBL. And unlike those old-school boomboxes, the JBL sports an IPX7 water-resistance rating, which means you can submerge it up to 3 meters.\n\nBut instead of old-school cassettes that would warble and occasionally self-destruct, the JBL streams smoothly from your phone via Bluetooth. Sonically, our testers find a very strong resemblance between the new model and the original JBL Boombox. Both feature bass that can rattle the walls\u2014or maybe your neighbor\u2019s fillings\u2014and that\u2019s not entirely a good thing.\n\nWhile our testers give the Boombox 2 a solid score for sound quality, they add a caveat that those robust low frequencies can be overwhelming with some music, explaining that this speaker would have scored even higher with a little less bass. The Boombox 2 might be less than great sitting on a desk in a small office, but its extreme low-frequency impact might be just the thing to pump up the Penn State fight song in the parking lot on a Saturday afternoon.\n\nFrom the Living Room to the Parking Lot\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for really great sound at your tailgate and you\u2019re willing to pay for it, the Ultimate Ears Hyperboom is a great option.\n\nOur testers report that the speaker is both loud and clear, with robust bass and clean midrange, and enough volume for most situations, indoors or out. They find the large controls easy to use, so the model gets good grades for versatility.\n\nThe Hyperboom also features an optical input, which allows it to serve as a TV sound bar or a way to upgrade the sound of a game console. UE claims an IPX4 water-resistance rating for the Hyperboom, which means it\u2019s splashproof and spillproof, but not designed to stand up to a full-fledged dunking.\n\nAlthough the Hyperboom isn\u2019t exactly small\u2014remember that speaker size and sound quality tend to go hand-in-hand\u2014its orientation is vertical, so the footprint is relatively compact, which is a plus at a tailgate. And compared with many top portables, the UE\u2019s styling is subdued, allowing it to be heard but not seen when you return it to your living room after the game.\n\nLights, Sound, and Action!\n\nAs you might expect from the name, Anker\u2019s SoundCore Rave PartyCast is quite the social animal.\n\nWhile the sound isn\u2019t especially refined compared with the very best wireless speakers in our ratings, the sonic flaws are relatively minor. The speaker is quite substantial in size, plays impressively loud, and, the manufacturer claims, it meets IPX 7 water-resistance standards, which allow for a dunk in shallow water\u2014or at least a bout with a spilled drink\u2014without serious harm. All of these features serve the PartyCast well in the parking lot.\n\nOur testers also find the PartyCast quite easy to use, with intuitive, always-on Bluetooth pairing. The model has USB and Aux inputs in case you want to plug in a source rather than streaming your source material. And the PartyCast feature allows you to connect up to 100 of the company\u2019s speakers at once.\n\nIf you want to add visual interest to your tailgate, the speaker has LED lights that sync to the music. And, if you\u2019re so inclined, it can blink to your favorite team\u2019s play-by-play.\n\nSony's Better-sounding Sibling\n\nHere\u2019s why reviews by Consumer Reports can be so important in making a purchasing decision. The Sony XG300 is very similar in appearance and design to the larger XG500, so you\u2019d expect that the two models would perform similarly, too.\n\nBut the XG300 is actually one of the better-sounding portable speakers we\u2019ve tested, with bass that\u2019s got a decent amount of sock and a clear, even midrange. By contrast, the bigger and more expensive XG500 fell short of its smaller sibling with bass that\u2019s kind of boomy while that all-important midrange is muffled.\n\nAnd while it\u2019s somewhat smaller than other models in this roundup, the XG300 does what you want in a tailgating speaker with decent volume, IP67 water resistance, and a rechargeable battery that delivers 25 hours of battery life, according to Sony.\n\nBig, Beefy, and Value-priced\n\nIf you want a speaker that\u2019s inexpensive, easy to transport, and checks most of the boxes you want for tailgating, then the ION Sport XL should be on your shopping list.\n\nIt\u2019s large and boxy and weighs just under 25 pounds, but, to help you manage that mass, it\u2019s got wheels, a roller-bag-style handle, as well as grab handles on the side. It\u2019s also IPX 5 water-resistant, says ION, which means it can withstand a light spill or a rain shower.\n\nSonically, the speaker provides enough volume to fill a large room, and the bass has decent impact, although the lowest bass notes don\u2019t go as deep as those on some other models. One of the handier features on the ION is an AM-FM tuner that allows you to tap into the local play-by-play during the game or find your favorite sports talk station and hear Vinnie from Queens rant about that controversial fourth-down call.\n\nConsumer Reports is an independent, nonprofit organization that works side by side with consumers to create a fairer, safer, and healthier world.

The appointment of Ryan Poles as the new general manager has been met with a sense of anticipation, as fans eagerly await the team's resurgence.\n\nThe intervening period, now spanning over three months, has been marked by an unexpected dearth of significant moves. The Bears' front office, once expected to make bold decisions, has instead maintained a relatively low profile. The initial optimism surrounding Poles' arrival has given way to a sense of uncertainty, as the team's prospects for the future remain unclear.\n\nPoles himself has been vocal about his commitment to revitalizing the franchise, and his tireless efforts in scouting, coaching, and strategy development have been well-documented. However, the lack of tangible progress has left fans wondering what the future holds.\n\nThe Bears face a critical juncture, with several options available but none particularly compelling. They could opt to rely on their current roster, hoping that internal improvements will suffice. Alternatively, they could explore free agency or the draft, although the constraints of their salary cap situation pose significant challenges.\n\nA third possibility, trading for new talent, is also fraught with risks, given the team's limited assets and the unpredictable nature of the market. The Bears' predicament is thus characterized by a sense of limbo, as they await a decisive course of action from their new general manager.\n\nWhile a rapid turnaround is unlikely, the team's lack of progress has created an air of uncertainty. The onus is now on Poles and the front office to make meaningful moves, leveraging their fresh perspective to guide the franchise towards a more promising future. Until then, the Bears will continue to navigate this period of flux, awaiting the clarity that only decisive action can bring.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "A pilot walks past the windows at the newly renovated Delta terminal D at LaGuardia Airport in New York March 6, 2021.\n\nDelta Air Lines and its pilots' union have reached a preliminary agreement for raises topping 30% over four years, a milestone deal that could sharply drive up aviators' pay across the industry.\n\nPilots' unions and airlines across the U.S. have been in tense negotiations for months if not years, as crews seek more compensation and better schedules.\n\nDelta pilots voted in October to authorize a strike if a deal wasn't reached, while pilots at several airlines have picketed this year demanding contract improvements. Delta and the union were edging toward a deal in mid-November, CNBC reported.\n\nUnions have complained about grueling schedules as travel snapped back from a pandemic slump. Delta and other U.S. carriers are profitable again, but a shortage of trained pilots has hampered carriers' recovery and contributed to higher airfare. It also gives pilots more power in contract negotiations. Labor and fuel are airlines' top two expenses.\n\nThe \"agreement-in-principle\" Delta reached with the Air Line Pilots Association is equal to $7.2 billion in cumulative value over four years, the union told members in an email late Friday. About a quarter of that is tied to quality-of-life improvements.\n\nThe agreement includes an 18% increase on the day the contract is signed, then a 5% increase one year later and two 4% raises in each of the following years. It also includes a one-time payment of 4% of 2020 and 2021 pay each, plus 14% of 2022 pay.\n\n\"We are pleased to have reached an agreement in principle for a new pilot contract, one that recognizes the contributions of our pilots to Delta's success,\" a Delta spokesman said in an emailed statement.\n\nAttempts at deals at American Airlines and United Airlines have so far failed but Delta's agreement could push talks along.\n\n\"We will take other carriers' ratified agreements, including United's, into account and update our pay proposals quickly when details are known,\" American's CEO Robert Isom said in a video message to pilots in June.\n\nThe Delta agreement said pay rates will exceed United's and American's pay by at least 1% over the course of the agreement, which still needs union and pilot approval.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "We all face demanding days that seem designed to test our self-control. Perhaps you are a barista, and you have some particularly rude and demanding customers, but you manage to keep your poise throughout. Or maybe you are finishing an important project and you have to remain in quiet concentration, without letting your attention slip to other distractions. If you are on a diet, you might have spent the past few hours resisting the cookie jar while the sweet treats silently whisper \u201ceat me\u201d.\n\nIn each case, you would have relied on your willpower, which psychologists define as the ability to avoid short-term temptations and override unwanted thoughts, feelings or impulses. And some people seem to have much greater reserves of it than others: they find it easier to control their emotions, avoid procrastination and stick to their goals, without ever seeming to lose their iron grip on their behaviour. Indeed, you may know some lucky people who, after a hard day at work, have the resolve to do something productive like a workout \u2013 while you give up on your fitness goals and fall for the temptations of junk food and trash TV.\n\nOur reserves of self-control and mental focus appear to be shaped by mindsets. And new studies suggest powerful strategies for anyone to build greater willpower \u2013 with huge benefits for your health, productivity and happiness.\n\nThe depleted ego\n\nUntil recently, the prevailing psychological theory proposed that willpower resembled a kind of battery. You might start the day with full strength, but each time you have to control your thoughts, feelings or behaviour, you zap that battery\u2019s energy. Without the chance to rest and recharge, those resources run dangerously low, making it far harder to maintain your patience and concentration, and to resist temptation.\n\nLaboratory tests appeared to provide evidence for this process; if participants were asked to resist eating cookies left temptingly on a table, for example, they subsequently showed less persistence when solving a mathematical problem, because their reserves of willpower had been exhausted. Drawing on the Freudian term for the part of the mind that is responsible for reining in our impulses, this process was known as \u201cego depletion\u201d. People who had high self-control might have bigger reserves of willpower initially, but even they would be worn down when placed under pressure.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The art of attempting to predict market fluctuations is a timeless and contentious topic in the realm of investing. As the S&P 500 has experienced a notable 13.5% increase this year, it may seem as though timing the markets has been successful. However, those who have attempted to do so have often fallen short.\n\nData from Bespoke Investment Group reveals that the five largest one-day losses for the S&P 500 in 2020 accounted for more than 80% of the index's overall losses for the year. Moreover, if one were to exclude the worst day of the year, March 12, when the index plummeted 9.5%, the S&P 500 would be up 14.5% instead of 13.5%.\n\nIn essence, if one had not owned the market on five specific days this year, they would have likely had a more successful year than if they had constantly traded in and out. This is not to say that the market is not volatile or that trading is not worthwhile, but rather it serves as a reminder that those who attempt to time the markets often take on excessive risk.\n\nThe five worst days of 2020, in terms of S&P 500 losses, were March 12 (-9.5%), September 3 (-5.6%), October 8 (-4.4%), June 11 (-4.4%), and December 21 (-4.1%). Collectively, these five days have accounted for more than 83% of the total losses for the S&P 500 in 2020.\n\nIt is no surprise, then, that the market has been relatively stable this year, despite various geopolitical tensions, a pandemic, and a contentious presidential election. While there have been brief pullbacks on some days, the market has largely experienced gains, particularly since the April low.\n\nThis illustrates one of the most enduring investing adages: buy and hold. If one were to purchase an index fund and simply remain patient, the odds are in their favor that they will ultimately experience positive returns. As 2020 has demonstrated, those who attempt to time the markets are more likely to incur losses.\n\nThis does not mean that there is no place for trading or investing strategies, but rather it serves as a cautionary tale. With the S&P 500 up for the year and such a significant portion of the losses concentrated in just five days, it is clear that timing the markets is not as straightforward as it may seem.\n\nThese five days were marked by significant turbulence and uncertainty, making it understandable why attempting to time the markets was not a successful endeavor. Investors should draw the lesson from this year's market experience: market timing is often a high-risk endeavor, and it can lead to substantial losses.\n\nIt is essential to recognize that investing is a long-term game, and one should focus on factors such as quality of earnings, valuations, and macroeconomic trends. If one is investing, they should adopt a long-term approach, ensure diversification, and be comfortable with the level of risk they are taking on.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The ad industry's volatile 2022 foreshadows even more change in 2023.\n\nUpstart ad channels like Netflix and retail media will have much to prove next year.\n\nThe ad industry is crossing its fingers that Twitter is a safe place to advertise.\n\n2022 was a volatile year for the advertising industry. While the industry as a whole readied for a spending downturn that's expected to last well into 2023, some firms, like agency holding companies, actually had stronger-than-expected results. The unstable economy also pushed non-advertising companies, like retailers and Netflix, to hurriedly ramp up nascent ad businesses.\n\nIndustry experts spoke with Insider and revealed their biggest shockers of 2022, and what it means for 2023.\n\nThe ad industry crashed, and probably won't recover in 2023\n\nAlex DeGroote, research director at Arden Partners, said the sharp ad spending slowdown largely reflects the Russian-Ukrainian war's drag on global economic growth, which was 6% in 2021, down to 3.2% in 2022, and is projected to be 2.7% in 2023.\n\nThe sudden collapse of Crypto-related ad budgets, once an industry bright spot, also dragged down ad spending.\n\nDeGroote believes the 2023 ad market growth forecasts from major ad buyers like GroupM (5.9% growth), and Magna (5% growth to $822 billion) are too optimistic.\n\n\"In a period of mega-high inflation, price promotion (discounting) on goods may be a more useful marketing tactic for some companies rather than mainstream advertising,\" he said.\n\nMeta and YouTube weren't immune to ad declines, but ad holding companies were\u2026 so far\n\nGoogle's and Meta's immunity to harsh economic conditions might be over, according to a November research note from Enders Analysis.\n\nThe note pointed out that even though Google and Meta have some factors in their favor, like a strong dollar, Google parent Alphabet's growth rate is at one of its lowest points ever, and Meta's growth rate is at its lowest.\n\n\"They are in for a protracted period of relative pain, though the real year-on-year growth of the big two will likely reach a short-term minimum,\" according to the note.\n\nYouTube, which had been one of Google's biggest growth engines, posted its first-ever year-over-year decline in October, and Google's ad revenue dipped $2 billion from the second to third quarter, as advertisers cut spend.\n\nMeta, has also seen its ad revenue decline, and has dumped $4 billion so far into building a so-called Metaverse, which hasn't driven any revenue yet. It's placed a big bet on a short-form video product called Reels to help resuscitate its ad revenue, but so far that hasn't captured any thunder from rival TikTok.\n\nApple's policies around consumer privacy have also cost ad businesses like Google and Meta billions.\n\nBut while the tech platforms flailed, the advertising holding companies over-performed. Agencies didn't enjoy the anomalous growth the tech giants saw during the pandemic, so they're not impacted as much by the current course correction, according to the Enders note.\n\nThat being said, the Enders note cautions that agencies' reprieve will end in 2023: \"The story for advertising as a whole is that growth is objectively weakening, and even agencies are now mostly seeing slowing growth after the post-2021 recovery.\"\n\nNetflix and every other streaming service launched ads \u2014 but that might not help advertisers\n\nNetflix had been so publicly opposed to advertising that the industry was taken aback when it changed tack this year, partnering with Microsoft's Xandr unit to expedite the launch of an ad business.\n\nNetflix joined a throng of companies vying for streaming ad dollars this year, including NBCUniversal's Peacock, Disney Plus, and HBO Max. These companies are using ads to offer cheaper subscription prices.\n\nAt the same time, consumers could be put off by the tyranny of choice.\n\n\"Consumers are being overwhelmed by a number of platforms, subscriptions, and prices,\" said David Helmreich, chief commercial officer at the TV adtech company Innovid. 2023 will see more fragmentation as content owners launch different bundles to try to attract subscribers, which will make it more difficult for consumers to find the content they want to watch. That fragmentation will also create more challenges for advertisers in measuring the effectiveness of their ads across multiple platforms, Helmreich said.\n\nDeGroote also predicts that this deluge of streaming ad offerings won't attract the younger consumers that advertisers want to reach the most. \"The reality is consumers under 30 years old greatly prefer short-form video over longer Netflix series,\" he said. This bodes well for TikTok's growth next year, he said.\n\nNew ad sellers like Best Buy exploded into the mainstream \u2014 but will have to prove their value in 2023\n\nCompanies who aren't thought to be ad sellers, like Uber and Best Buy all built ad businesses en masse this year.\n\n\"Everything is, or could be, an ad network, and they will be addressable,\" said Chad Engelgau, Global CEO of Acxiom. \"Anything that requires an email address to access, including your Apple devices, can and will serve ads.\"\n\nMost of the companies launching ad businesses are retailers, which created a lucrative category called retail media \u2014 one that GroupM estimates will be worth $160 billion by 2027. Adtech firms like Criteo staked the future of their businesses around retail media, and others like The Trade Desk are aggressively trying to horn in to snatch retail ad dollars.\n\nRetail media providers are hoping to snatch budget from advertisers who are having trouble finding consumers due to Apple's privacy policies and the loss of third-party cookies. Yet, with so many options, and a tough economic situation, retailers will have to really stand out to grab ad dollars in 2023. Many, like Kroger, are hoping to dip into budget that had previously been earmarked for TV.\n\nElon Musk acquires Twitter\n\nMusk's acquisition of Twitter \u2014 and subsequent decimation of its employee ranks, including its revenue-driving advertising operations \u2014 shook the ad industry.\n\nSince taking over, Musk appointed Twitter vet Robin Wheeler to head up advertising, and subsequently fired her. Chris Riedy then assumed the role in late November, to convince vacating advertisers to stay.\n\n\"We are hopeful that the new management at Twitter will be able to strike a healthy balance of content moderation, safety and transparency to enable it to thrive on behalf of consumers, marketers, and society in 2023,\" said David Cohen, CEO of the IAB, an ad industry trade group.", "label": "human"}

However, whether it can help prevent injury is another matter.\n\nA professor of biomechanics from the Norwegian School of Sports Science, Dr Hannah Rice looks at how people walk and run with a view to understanding injury risk. She tells Greg that the preoccupation with cushioning and measures to prevent pronation (how much your foot moves inwards when you run) could be misleading.\n\nShe also explains that recent research under the banner of the 'preferred movement path paradigm' suggests that \"whatever shoe you put a person in, the skeleton will follow a particular path during running and you're not really able to change it with footwear or with insoles\".\n\n4.

These plates maximise the amount of energy that\u2019s pushing the foot forward. The combination of this propulsion and the saved energy are \"significant enough to add a small benefit to athletes that are looking to run faster, particularly at high speeds\".\n\nHowever, this improved performance means a reduced level of effort, a lower energy demand resulting in a less effective workout. That's important if you\u2019re going for a 30-minute run on your lunch break to stay in shape.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Disney (DIS) CEO Bob Iger has five big questions to address in the new year as he settles in, once again, to the high-powered executive role.\n\nThe company saw shares slide roughly 45% in 2022, marking the worst annual stock performance for the House of Mouse since 1974.\n\nIt's a much different story compared to March 2021 when the share price peaked at just under $202 as the stay-at-home trade boosted consumer-facing media giants and its fledgling streaming service Disney+ saw early subscriber success.\n\nNow, as rising costs, debt-ridden balance sheets, and a renewed focus on profitability weigh on the media sector overall, Iger must navigate a bruised business beset with leadership challenges, unfavorable price increases, and a direct-to-consumer division struggling to turn a profit.\n\nHow do you make the streaming business profitable?\n\nThe first and most important question Iger must address? Streaming profitability.\n\n\"Streaming losses [are] the absolute number one issue on hand,\" Geetha Ranganathan, senior media analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, previously told Yahoo Finance Live. \"We've seen the streaming business at Disney already lose about $8 billion. They're expected to lose another $3 billion in fiscal 2023, so obviously Bob Iger really has to go back and articulate a much better strategy.\"\n\nIn late November, Iger gave investors a taste of what seemed to be the first step of that strategy \u2014 firing Kareem Daniel and restructuring Disney's Media and Entertainment Distribution (DMED) division, one of former CEO Bob Chapek's first big swings.\n\n\"As you know, this is a time of enormous change and challenges in our industry, and our work will also focus on creating a more efficient and cost-effective structure,\" Iger said at the time of the reorganization.\n\nWalt Disney CEO Bob Iger attends the European premiere of \"The Lion King\" in London, Britain July 14, 2019. REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nIn its most recent fiscal year, losses for Disney's direct-to-consumer unit, which includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, totaled $4 billion for the year. High content costs were largely to blame as the company upped its content budget by $8 billion in 2022 to a whopping $33 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nManagement said it expects streaming losses to shrink by about $200 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2023 before reaching profitability in fiscal 2024.\n\nOne way the company plans to stick to that timeline is through layoffs and hiring freezes first implemented by Chapek shortly before his ouster.\n\nIger, while speaking at a town hall with employees, revealed there were no plans to reverse the hiring freeze as he continues to evaluate Disney's current cost structure \u2014 an evaluation investors will be hyper-focused on in 2023.\n\nWill Disney buy out Comcast's stake in Hulu?\n\nAs Iger charts a path to streaming profitably, he will likely have to decide the fate of streaming giant Hulu.\n\nDisney owns two-thirds of Hulu with Comcast's (CMCSA) NBCUniversal controlling the rest. Under the terms of the 2019 agreement, which set Disney's guaranteed minimum equity value for Hulu at $27.5 billion, Comcast could require Disney to buy out its stake as early as January 2024.\n\nWhich is what NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell said he expects will happen.\n\n\"We have a put, they have a call,\" Shell said at an investor conference last month. \"We think [Hulu] is worth a lot of money because it's sold on a full control basis as if you were auctioning it off. And I think [there are] no indications that anything else is going to happen [other] than Disney writing us a big check for the asset in 2024.\"\n\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.\n\nSome analysts, however, have suggested Disney could sell its majority stake to help offset accelerating streaming losses amid an ultra-competitive landscape.\n\n\"Personally, I think selling Hulu would be a good idea,\" Doug Creutz, senior analyst at Cowen, previously told Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nThe analyst, who said Hulu is \"not a Disney-branded product,\" explained the media giant \"would be better off really focusing on the strengths of the company \u2014 that branded, high-quality, family content, rather than trying to be everything to everybody.\"\n\nLightshed Partners\u2019 Richard Greenfield agreed, writing in a November blog post: \"Hulu\u2019s actual worth is unclear if Disney wants to keep the Hulu original programming created by Disney for Disney+.\"\n\n\"Essentially, Iger has to decide on a streaming strategy,\" Greenfield said. \"Does Disney want to run multiple streaming services as they do now, focus all their energy on a vertically-integrated and more narrow Disney+ strategy or do they envision a world with just one 'everything' Disney service (combining Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+)?\"\n\nESPN: Keep or spin off?\n\nIn addition to Hulu, media analysts have long questioned the murky future of ESPN and whether or not Disney should consider spinning off the popular sports network \u2014 a suggestion previously made by Third Point's Dan Loeb.\n\nLoeb argued ESPN would have greater flexibility to pursue business initiatives, such as sports betting, if it were not part of Disney.\n\n\"DIS will begin the spin-off process for ESPN & ABC including launching ESPN in streaming a la carte,\" Wells Fargo analyst Steve Cahall wrote in a note published late last month. \"Cost rationalization and balance sheet options are critical to reaching this outcome. The result is a better-off remaining DIS.\"\n\nBut not everyone agrees.\n\n\"We're very much against spinning off ESPN... that's the dumbest thing ever,\" Jason Bazinet, managing director at Citi, previously told Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nBazinet went on to explain ESPN has the potential to be a much bigger global business, especially if Disney chooses to leverage the internet for distribution. He also said the network generates the bulk of Disney's cash flow, which will ultimately fund its pivot to direct-to-consumer and help offset accelerating streaming losses.\n\n\"What Disney is embarking upon with a direct-to-consumer business is very much like a cable company or a telecom company,\" Bazinet said, stressing how DTC bridges the gap between the consumer and sports rights. \"They should not spin it off.\"\n\nIn its most recent fiscal year, Disney's operating income for its Linear Networks segment \u2014 which includes ESPN \u2014 totaled $8.52 billion.\n\nParks: Will Iger do away with Chapek-era price hikes?\n\nFollowing earlier price hikes in February 2022, Disney again raised prices for most of its Florida theme parks on December 8, upping the costs of single-day and multi-day tickets, in addition to the renewals for its annual pass program, the Genie+ app, merchandise, food, and other in-park purchases.\n\nThe price hikes, which were already in effect at Disneyland Anaheim, were a cause of widespread backlash during former CEO Bob Chapek's tenure.\n\nDisney fans angered by recent price hikes at its theme parks\n\nEven Iger was reportedly taken aback by the sharp increases.\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, the executive was \"alarmed by increases in prices at Disney theme parks that Mr. Chapek argued would boost revenue and limit overcrowding.\"\n\nDisney's theme parks missed expectations in its latest quarter as recession fears pressured consumer demand. Revenue from the company's parks, experiences, and consumer products division came in at $7.43 billion (vs. estimates of $7.59 billion), with operating income hitting $1.51 billion (vs. estimates of $1.9 billion.)\n\nAlthough it is unlikely that Iger will reverse the price hikes, could Disney fans see a reduction in the number of increases in 2023?\n\nWho will be the next Disney CEO?\n\nEven though Iger just regained his CEO position, investors are already thinking about his replacement.\n\nRumors have swirled that internal candidates like Dana Walden, Disney General Entertainment Content Chairman, Alan Bergman, Walt Disney Studios Chairman, or Josh D'Amaro, Disney Parks, Experiences and Products Chairman, could be next in line.\n\nOther possibilities include former employees Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs, who left the company in 2020 after being passed over by Iger for the CEO role that ultimately went to Chapek.\n\nMayer and Staggs currently run Blackstone-backed entertainment startup Candle Media, which recently acquired Reese Witherspoon\u2019s Hello Sunshine production company in a deal worth $900 million. Could Iger possibly purchase Candle Media to lure back Mayer and Staggs?\n\nWhatever occurs, analysts have said Iger's surprise return will likely complicate the journey in finding a long-term CEO.\n\n\"For Iger to come back after just a few years and retake control, whoever is the next CEO of Disney, they're going to be looking over their shoulder from day one wondering if they're really the CEO of the company or if they're going to get pushed out like Chapek did,\" Doug Cruetz, media analyst at Cowen, previously told Yahoo Finance Live.\n\n\"That's not a great position for Disney to be in if they're trying to find a person who can lead the company successfully, starting in 2024 and forward,\" he cautioned.\n\nDisney's top contenders to succeed CEO Bob Iger\n\nAlexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Media Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

They found 55.5 inches of snow depth, which is 177% higher than average for the location, according to a statement from the department.\n\nRead more\n\nSome of the recent snowpack came from a storm that blew over the state this past week, sparking widespread flooding and dropping several inches of snow on California mountain ranges.

If January through March of 2023 turn out to be similar to last year, we would still end the water year in severe drought with only half of an average year\u2019s snowpack.\u201d\n\nBack in December 2021, a snowstorm dropped almost 17 feet of snow over the Sierra Nevada mountains. But by March 2022, officials found only 2.5 inches of snow at the Phillips Station near Lake Tahoe. The average snow depth for the end of the season in that area is supposed to be 5 feet, according to the water resources department. Snow levels throughout the state were only 38% of what they should have been at that time of year.

Soldier Pavlo Pryzhehodskiy, 27, played a song on guitar he had written at the front after 12 of his comrades were killed in a single night.\n\n\"It is sad that instead of meeting friends, celebrating and giving gifts to one another people were forced to seek shelter, some were killed,\" he told Reuters. \"It is a huge tragedy. It is a huge tragedy that cannot ever be forgiven. That is why the New Year is sad.\"\n\nIn a nearby front line trench, soldier Oleh Zahrodskiy, 49, said he had signed up as a volunteer after his son was called up to fight as a reservist. His son was now in a hospital in the southern city of Dnipro, fighting for his life with a brain injury, while his father manned the front.\n\n\"It is very tough now,\" he said, holding back tears.\n\n'HAPPY NEW YEAR'\n\nAndrii Nebytov, chief of Kyiv's police, posted a photo on his Telegram messaging app, showing what was described as a piece of drone used in an attack on the capital, with a hand-written sign on it in Russian saying \"Happy New Year\".\n\n\"This wreckage is not at the front, where fierce battles are taking place, this is here, on a sports grounds, where children play,\" Nebytov said.\n\nRussia has flattened Ukrainian cities and killed thousands of civilians since Putin ordered his invasion in February, claiming Ukraine was an artificial state whose pro-Western outlook threatened Russia's security.

In recent weeks, the front lines have been largely static, with thousands of soldiers dying in intense trench warfare as Moscow defends its grip on captured territory.\n\nSince October, Russia has launched mass missile and drone attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, casting cities into darkness and cold as winter sets in. Moscow says the strikes aim to reduce Ukraine's ability to fight; Kyiv says they have no military purpose and are intended to hurt civilians, a war crime.\n\n\"The main thing is the fate of Russia,\" a stern-faced Putin said in his New Year's Eve address, speaking in front of a group of people dressed in military uniform instead of the normal backdrop of the Kremlin walls. \"Defence of the fatherland is our sacred duty to our ancestors and descendants. Moral, historical righteousness is on our side.\"\n\nZelenskiy delivered his own address in near darkness, in front of a fluttering Ukrainian flag. He described the year past as a national awakening.\n\n\"We were told: you have no other option but to surrender. We say: we have no other option than to win,\" he said.\n\n\"This year has struck our hearts. We've cried out all the tears. We've shouted all the prayers,\" Zelenskiy said. \"We fight and will continue to fight.

{"text": "TikTok has rapidly become a leading social media platform among young people worldwide. In the past year, the app has witnessed a significant surge in users and content. As with any popular platform, trends emerge and fade. This year, wellness was the dominant trend, showing no signs of slowing down. From yoga challenges to self-care Sundays, TikTok users incorporated wellness into their daily routines. Here's a review of the best and worst of this trend in 2022.\n\nBest: Yoga Challenges\n\nOne of the most popular wellness trends on TikTok in 2022 was the yoga challenge. This trend has been around for a few years but gained immense popularity this year. Yoga challenges allow users to practice various yoga poses in a short period, record the results, and share them with friends. The more challenging the poses, the better. It's an easy and fun way to get into yoga, improving core strength and balance. Plus, it's a great way to socialize with friends who share an interest in yoga.\n\nWorst: Misleading Wellness Advice\n\nUnfortunately, not all wellness content on TikTok was beneficial this year. There was an abundance of misleading wellness advice and claims circulating on the app. This includes claims that certain foods or supplements can cure serious illnesses, as well as unsafe DIY treatments and massage techniques. Fortunately, TikTok has taken steps to discourage this kind of content and is actively working to remove it from the platform.\n\nBest: Self-Care Sundays\n\nOne of the biggest wellness trends of the year was the Self-Care Sunday challenge. This challenge encourages users to take some time out of their Sunday routine to focus on self-care. Participants can do anything that makes them feel good, such as taking a bath, giving themselves a face mask, or simply relaxing for a few minutes. This challenge is great for reminding people to prioritize self-care, which can help reduce stress and make life more enjoyable.\n\nWorst: Unrealistic Digital Detoxes\n\nAnother wellness trend that gained traction this year was the virtual detox. The idea behind this trend is that you're \"detoxing\" your life by spending a certain amount of time without technology or social media. However, many experts warn against this kind of detox as it can be unhealthy and unproductive. The overuse of technology can lead to various mental health issues, but taking a complete break from it is not the answer. Instead, try taking regular breaks from your devices or engage in healthier online activities.\n\nBest: Mental Health Awareness\n\nMental health is a crucial issue, and it's great to see TikTok users embracing this trend in 2022. Mental health challenges encourage users to openly talk about their feelings and be honest about their struggles. These challenges can help promote a healthy attitude towards mental health, reduce the stigma of talking about it, and offer support to those who are struggling.\n\nOverall, TikTok wellness trends in 2022 had their ups and downs. However, it seems that users were mostly using the platform to focus on self-care and mental health. This can only be a positive development, as it's essential to prioritize one's well-being. Whether it's taking a yoga challenge or having a Self-Care Sunday, we should all embrace TikTok's wellness trends and make sure to stay healthy in the new year.", "label": "machine"}

This decision is part of a broader effort to address concerns surrounding digital platforms and their handling of personal data.\n\nThe European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, has directed Meta to reassess the legal basis for its personalized advertising rules, citing concerns about the lack of a clear legal foundation for these practices. Specifically, the Commission is worried about the absence of a clear opt-out mechanism for individuals and the use of tracking mechanisms such as cookies and identifiers.\n\nMeta, a prominent platform for advertising and marketing, has been ordered to provide convincing evidence that its rules comply with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR is a cornerstone of the EU's digital economy, aimed at protecting the rights of EU citizens to privacy and data protection.\n\nThe Commission has also instructed Meta to take action to ensure its practices align with the GDPR and other EU legislation, including the e-Privacy Regulation. This includes ensuring that ads are targeted based on user consent and other legitimate interests, providing clear information about the data used for targeted ads, and informing users when their personal data is used.\n\nThis development is part of a larger effort by European authorities to ensure that data-driven services, such as online advertisements, are fair and protect consumers.

{"text": "The National Football League (NFL) is facing a pressing issue, and it's none other than Damar Hamlin, a safety from the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nHamlin, a third-year player, was drafted in the sixth round of the 2018 draft and has since become a staple in the Steelers' defense. However, he has also become a lightning rod for criticism, with fans and pundits alike accusing him of taking cheap shots, playing dirty, and being a generally disruptive presence on the field.\n\nHamlin has been suspended multiple times for his on-field behavior, including a four-game suspension this season for a helmet-to-helmet hit on Colts quarterback Jacoby Brissett. He has also been fined several times for unnecessary roughness and was suspended for a game during the playoffs for an illegal hit on an opposing player.\n\nThe most concerning aspect of Hamlin's behavior is his tendency to rely on physicality and intimidation to disrupt opposing offenses. His hits, while legal, are often vicious and target the opponent's head, which is a worrying pattern of behavior.\n\nThe NFL is in a difficult position, as they want to keep a talented player like Hamlin in the league, but they also need to ensure player safety and the integrity of the game. The league has taken some steps to punish Hamlin, but it remains to be seen whether they will take more decisive action.\n\nThe NFL needs to set a strong example by sending a message to all players that dangerous behavior will not be tolerated. It's worth noting that Hamlin is not the only player in the league whose on-field behavior has been a concern, and the league needs to address this issue before it gets worse.\n\nHamlin is a talented player, but he has no place in a league that values player safety above all else. It's time for the NFL to show that it won't tolerate players like him.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "For over eight decades, Pel\u00e9 has been an iconic representation of happiness, perseverance, and global unity. He mesmerized countless football enthusiasts worldwide with his bold, aerial style and remarkable on-field achievements. As of 2023, Pel\u00e9's health had significantly declined due to advanced age, and his family announced his passing last week, sending the world into mourning.\n\nToday, Brazilians honored the life and legacy of the King of Football with a grand farewell ceremony and a spectacular procession that drew tens of thousands of people to the Sambodrome in Rio de Janeiro, as well as over a million others who followed online. The day-long tribute commenced with a 21-gun salute in Pel\u00e9's honor and concluded with a stirring mass celebration featuring iconic Brazilian music, dance, and performance art.\n\nPel\u00e9's family and closest friends paid their respects with a brief and poignant vigil inside the Sambodrome. His sons and grandchildren, accompanied by a select group of football legends, carried his coffin to a stage in the arena's center, where it was adorned with mementos from his life and career. As traditional drums resonated through the stadium and fireworks illuminated the night sky, a large crowd of mourners surrounded Pel\u00e9's body and sang the classic Brazilian anthem in his honor.\n\nFollowing several hours of celebration, Pel\u00e9's coffin was placed in a specially designed hearse and taken on a journey through the city of Rio. Thousands of people lined the streets and bridges to watch and pay their respects as the procession made its way to the Maracan\u00e3 Stadium, where Pel\u00e9 scored his 1,000th goal and a plaque bearing his name and nickname, \"O Rei (the King),\" remains today.\n\nAt Maracan\u00e3, the coffin procession paused so that Pel\u00e9's friends, family, and fans could gather around his casket in solemn respect. A massive Brazilian flag hung in the stadium, symbolizing Pel\u00e9's profound legacy and the deep impact he left on Brazilian culture.\n\nThe procession eventually continued, coming to rest in a small village outside Rio. There, a small ceremony marked the final stop of the journey, and Pel\u00e9's remains were buried in a special plot of land beneath a bronze sculpture of the three-time World Cup champion. Throughout the day, the villagers toasted with caipirinhas, a Brazilian cocktail, in honor of their nation's King of Football.\n\nAs the sun set on an emotional day for Brazilians, the citizens of Rio and beyond looked to the sky and thanked Pel\u00e9 for the memories and inspiration he brought to the world. Pel\u00e9 made football a game of dreams and joy, and in the process, united a nation and changed lives forever. His remarkable impact will not be forgotten.\n\nSo, here's to you, Pel\u00e9. Thank you for the memories, and may you rest in peace.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "A notable figure in the Catholic Church, Joseph Ratzinger, passed away at the age of 93, leaving behind a mixed legacy. He was a prominent leader who implemented changes and reforms, but also faced criticism for his handling of the sexual abuse crisis.\n\nRatzinger was appointed as the Pope in 2005, following the death of his predecessor. He chose the name Benedict XVI, honoring two of his predecessors who also bore the name. He was the first German Pope in centuries and the oldest to take the position at 78 years old.\n\nDuring his tenure, Ratzinger focused on developing new theological guidelines and building bridges with other Christian denominations. He was a strong advocate for the Church's stance on abortion, contraception, and same-sex relationships. He also worked to revitalize the papacy's diplomatic efforts, engaging in regular meetings with representatives of other religions and making public appearances abroad.\n\nHowever, Ratzinger faced criticism for his handling of the sexual abuse crisis. In 2001, he issued a letter stating that sexual abuse of minors by priests was a \"particularly grave offense.\" He suggested that bishops could avoid costly civil litigation by using church tribunals to prosecute such cases. Critics argued that Ratzinger should have done more to make known the Church's position against sexual abuse and that his directive shifted responsibility onto local bishops rather than the Vatican.\n\nRatzinger expressed his own sorrow for the suffering caused by the crisis and issued a statement in 2012 expressing his \"profound grief\" at the \"unspeakable criminal acts\" committed by priests. He acknowledged that he was \"deeply ashamed\" and vowed to take steps to prevent such incidents from happening again.\n\nThroughout his papacy, Ratzinger sought to reconnect the Church with its traditional teachings and intellectual foundations. He initiated major reform efforts in areas such as liturgy, ecumenical dialogue, and the Church's relationship with the modern world. He also granted over 1,000 interviews and authored several books defending and clarifying Catholic teachings on faith and morals.\n\nFollowing his death, tributes have poured in from around the world, with many commentators noting that Ratzinger was a deeply devout and intellectual man who made a positive impact on the Church and society. While his legacy is complex, it is clear that Ratzinger left a lasting impression on the Catholic Church.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "In this photo illustration, the image of Elon Musk is displayed on a computer screen and the logo of twitter on a mobile phone in Ankara, Turkiye on October 06, 2022.\n\nTwitter appears to have paused its $7.99/month Blue subscription service, which allowed people to pay for a verification check mark, after users were abusing it to impersonate brands and famous people.\n\nTwitter launched the service earlier this week in its iPhone app, allowing users to buy a checkmark that had previously been used to show that an account was verified or official. As of Friday, the iPhone app no longer shows an option to sign up for Twitter Blue.\n\nThe quick suspension of the service suggests that, at least currently, CEO Elon Musk's big plan to generate new revenue from users isn't working as expected.\n\nThe paid subscription service led to a plethora of pranksters creating imposter accounts on Twitter. It left the platform even more ripe for misinformation, and many cheaply acquired checkmarks were used to impersonate brands, politicians and celebrities with unflattering messages.\n\nOne current sales employee at Twitter said the company decided to pull back on Twitter Blue verification in response to the spate of impersonators.\n\nThe employee, who asked to remain unnamed since they were not authorized to speak on behalf of Twitter, said one account resembling pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly caused a serious problem when it tweeted out, \"we are excited to announce insulin is free now.\"\n\nThe tweet remained on the social media platform for hours before it was taken down. The real Eli Lilly account later tweeted: \"We apologize to those who have been served a misleading message from a fake Lilly account.\"\n\nEli Lilly's stock price dropped sharply after the false message was posted, and so did other pharmaceutical companies including AbbVie, which was also impersonated on Twitter. At that time, major stock indices were positive, amidst a market rally.\n\nAn impersonator also pilloried Tesla , Elon Musk's electric car maker using the paid subscriber blue checkmark. An account with the handle that appeared as \"@TeslaReal\" wrote a flurry of disparaging tweets, one of which said, \"honestly the 53% drop in stock price doesn't phase[sic] us. if there's anyone who knows about Crashing it's us.\"\n\nThe effect of so many changes on the Twitter platform presents a big problem for advertisers, some of which have already paused spending there.\n\nAdditionally, some users who already paid for the service said their recently acquired blue checkmarks have disappeared from their accounts.\n\nA Twitter spokesperson was not immediately available for comment. Musk was not immediately available for comment.\n\nThe rollback of Twitter Blue verified comes at a time when Musk and Alex Spiro, who is acting as Twitters top lawyer now, are working to reassure employees, advertisers and regulators that they will comply with all laws and terms of a prior FTC consent decree.\n\nElon Musk wrote in a companywide email obtained by CNBC on Thursday night, \"I cannot emphasize enough that Twitter will do whatever it takes to adhere to both the letter and spirit of the FTC consent decree. Anything you read to the contrary is absolutely false. The same goes for any other government regulatory matters where Twitter operates.\"\n\nSpiro said in another e-mail that followed that his team had spoken with FTC regulators on Thursday and that Twitter has its \"first upcoming compliance check\" with the agency soon. He emphasized that Twitter itself, not \"individuals who work at Twitter\" would be held liable for any violations.\n\nAs NBC News previously reported, an exodus of Twitter executives since Musk took over has included the departure of the company's head of trust and safety, Yoel Roth, and chief of information security, Lea Kessner among many others involved in infrastructure, trust and safety.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The VanEck company has declared that it will be gradually closing down its three Russia-related investment funds due to the current circumstances in Ukraine. The decision was made in response to the Russian invasion of eastern Ukraine, which has led to a freeze on U.S. investment in the country.\n\nThe three funds, launched in February, were designed to track the performance of Russian companies and had a combined total of $120 million in assets under management as of October 31. Despite still being listed on U.S. stock exchanges, VanEck is actively working to facilitate a smooth closure of the funds due to the current situation.\n\nThe decision was prompted by U.S. government sanctions on Russia, which were imposed in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine. These sanctions have significantly impacted investment into Russia, particularly from U.S. firms, and have had a notable effect on the Russian stock market.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury has warned U.S. investors that it may take action against those who engage in transactions involving Russian assets, and that funds invested in Russia could be frozen or blocked. This has led to a significant drop in the value of the Russian assets held by VanEck's funds, resulting in substantial losses for the fund managers and investors.\n\nTo protect its investors, VanEck has chosen to close its funds and is taking the necessary steps to ensure an orderly closure. The company is committed to safeguarding the interests of its investors and believes that closing the funds is the right decision given the current circumstances.\n\nVanEck's funds are not the only ones affected by the U.S. sanctions on Russia. BlackRock and iShares have also announced plans to close their Russia-related investment funds in response to the sanctions.\n\nThe move is likely to have a significant impact on the U.S. investment landscape, as the funds had become increasingly popular among investors seeking exposure to the Russian market. It also demonstrates the power of sanctions in shaping the global financial landscape and how the actions of a single nation can have a ripple effect across the world.\n\nThe closure of VanEck's Russia ETFs may also be seen as a sign that the U.S. and its allies are serious about punishing Russia for its actions in Ukraine. The winding down of the funds is a clear indication that the U.S. and its allies are willing to use economic measures to pressure Russia into changing its behavior.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "The majority of people do not associate running with cold weather. While it is indeed pleasant to run outdoors when it is warm, running in cold weather is also beneficial for you. Running in cold weather actually has many advantages. Below are three important reasons why running in cold weather is good for you.\n\nBenefit 1: You burn more calories\n\nOne of the most significant advantages of running in cold weather is that you will burn more calories. When it is cold, your body works harder to keep warm, and as a result, your body burns more calories during running. If you want to challenge yourself, you can run faster in cold weather. Increasing your pace increases the number of calories you burn.\n\nBenefit 2: You have less chance of getting injured\n\nWhen it is warm, you can overheat by running too fast. This can lead to your body becoming overexerted, making you more prone to injuries. In cold weather, you can avoid this, as your body does not need to dissipate heat. Additionally, your muscles and joints will be cooler, making them easier to move. This means you have less chance of getting injured, even if you run fast.\n\nBenefit 3: Your body strengthens\n\nWhen you run in cold weather, your heart rate is lower than in warm weather. When your heart rate is low, your body strengthens more. The low heart rate also makes it easier to find your rhythm during running, making it easier to achieve your goals.\n\nIn summary, there are many benefits to running in cold weather. So, if you plan to go outside for a run, do not forget to be careful. Clothing is crucial, so wear warm and breathable material. Do not inhale cold air during running, so wear a buff or hat. If you keep these tips in mind, your body will thank you for the benefits you gain from running in cold weather.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao reports that customer deposits are gradually returning to the cryptocurrency exchange after a $40 million security breach earlier this year, but the road ahead will be \"challenging.\"\n\nSpeaking at the Asia Blockchain Summit in Taipei, Taiwan, Zhao stated that the firm's losses were \"not insignificant\" and that it had to \"reorganize certain teams and business units\" following the attack.\n\nThe attack, which occurred in May, allowed hackers to steal 7,000 Bitcoins (BTC) from Binance's hot wallet. At the time, the value of the stolen cryptocurrency was approximately $40 million, but its price has since risen to around $69 million.\n\nZhao mentioned that as a result, Binance took measures to safeguard its customers. \"We had to take some temporary measures such as limiting deposits and withdrawals, and performing additional user verifications,\" he said.\n\nHowever, he added that the firm has implemented various security measures to protect user funds and prevent similar incidents in the future. \"We enhanced our security, introduced advanced 2FA, began conducting KYC [Know Your Customer] checks and anti-fraud checks,\" Zhao said.\n\nHe also mentioned that the firm is making progress on its insurance fund, designed to protect users' funds in the event of a security breach. \"We've gradually been building up our insurance fund, and so far, it appears to be functioning well,\" he said.\n\nOverall, Zhao stated that customer deposits have started to return, but the road ahead remains \"challenging.\"\n\n\"We're making progress in recovering customer deposits, which is a positive development,\" he said. \"However, I believe the road ahead will be challenging, and we must be mindful of how we allocate our resources and reorganize our priorities.\"\n\nDespite the attack, Binance has continued to grow and expand its services. In October, it launched its own crypto debit card and a new trading platform targeting institutional investors.\n\nZhao mentioned that Binance is also planning to roll out a new \"decentralized\" platform. \"We're attempting to build a decentralized exchange,\" he said. \"We're exploring a hybrid approach where the customer side remains centralized, but the backend is decentralized.\"\n\nIn addition, Zhao stated that the company is looking to expand into other areas beyond just crypto. \"We're considering offering other services, such as staking, decentralized finance, and other services to our users,\" he said.\n\nOverall, Zhao expressed optimism about the firm's future. \"We remain optimistic about the cryptocurrency industry and our role in it,\" he said. \"We're making progress in recovering customer deposits, and so far, it appears to be functioning well.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The nuclear fusion breakthrough heralded on Tuesday was a historic event, culminating decades of research.\n\nAt the same time, fusion power will not be contributing electricity to any power grid for at least a decade, according to most industry watchers. To get there, there will have to be many more technical breakthroughs beyond what was celebrated on Tuesday \u2014 and the money to fund them.\n\nJust after 1 a.m. on Monday, Dec. 5, researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California executed a successful experiment to produce more energy from a nuclear fusion reaction than went into the lasers used to power the reaction.\n\n\"We got out 3.15 megajoules, we put in 2.05 megajoules in the laser,\" said Mark Herrmann, a program director at Lawrence Livermore, on Tuesday. \"That's never been done before in any fusion laboratory anywhere in the world. So it's super exciting.\"\n\nIn a technical panel discussion after the main press announcement on Tuesday, scientists on the team recounted their reactions on learning the news.\n\nTammy Ma, a laser-plasma physicist at the lab, was waiting in an airport when her boss called her. \"I burst into tears. I was jumping up and down in the waiting area, the crazy person.\"\n\nIt took about 300 megajoules of energy from the electricity grid to fire the laser that was used in the experiment, said Herrmann on Tuesday. That's equivalent to what is included in about two-and-a-half gallons of gasoline.\n\nAll of that energy went into the laser fusion reaction that showed net gain of about 1.1 megajoules \u2014 enough energy to boil a teakettle maybe two or three times.\n\n\"This is a science achievement, not a practical one,\" Omar A. Hurricane, a chief scientist at Lawrence Livermore, told CNBC.\n\nBut the amount of energy isn't the point. \"The laser wasn't designed to be efficient. The laser was designed to give us as much juice as possible to make this incredible conditions possible,\" Herrmann said. \"So there are many, many steps that would have to be made in order to get to an inertial fusion as an energy source.\"\n\nThat's partly because National Ignition Facility, where the demonstration took place, is 20 years old, and was constructed using technological components made in the 1980s and 1990s. Laser technology has progressed significantly since then.\n\nThe reason for the celebration was simply that energy was created at all.\n\n\"It's exciting because it proves that fusion can work, and it opens the floodgates to further interest, investment, and innovation toward turning fusion into a power source,\" said Arthur Turrell, a plasma physicist and the author of The Star Builders.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The following passage is a rewritten version of the original text, designed to evade detection by classification detectors:\n\nA revitalized focus on sustainable energy solutions is driving growth in the renewable energy sector.\n\nAfter a challenging 2020, the clean energy industry has recovered and is poised for continued success. A recent report from JPMorgan highlights the sector's immense potential and its increasing importance in the global energy landscape.\n\nHere's a summary of JPMorgan's top picks for the clean energy sector in 2023:\n\nFirstly, General Electric is a leading manufacturer of power generation and energy storage solutions. The company is expanding its renewable energy portfolio and investing in wind and solar projects. GE is also well-positioned in the rapidly growing smart grid market, leveraging digital technologies to optimize grid management.\n\nNext, Orsted, a Danish renewable energy company, has rapidly expanded its operations in recent years. With a strong presence in offshore wind farms in Europe, Orsted is now focusing on expanding its operations in other regions, including the U.S. The company has recently invested in a significant solar project in the U.S. and is expected to play a significant role in the global clean energy market.\n\nSolarEdge, an Israeli firm, designs and manufactures power electronics for residential and commercial solar PV systems. The company's products are driving down the cost of solar installations, making them more accessible and attractive to consumers. SolarEdge is also heavily involved in the growing market for home energy management systems.\n\nJPMorgan also recommends EDP Renewables, a Portuguese renewable energy company with a portfolio of wind, solar, and hydroelectric power plants in various regions. The company is one of the largest wind energy producers globally and is focusing on expanding its operations in Latin America.\n\nLastly, Enel, an Italian utility firm, is expanding its portfolio of clean energy projects worldwide. The company has made a significant commitment to renewable energy and aims to reduce its carbon emissions by 80% by 2050. Enel is investing in various clean energy projects and seeks to become a major player in the sector.\n\nOverall, JPMorgan's top picks for the clean energy sector in 2023 appear to be solid investments for the future. These companies are well-positioned to capitalize on the growing trend towards renewable energy and the transition away from traditional sources of power. As the clean energy sector continues to grow, these companies are likely to benefit from the expansion and offer investors an attractive long-term opportunity.", "label": "machine"}

Meta is down 66%. Google's off 37%, while Apple and Microsoft tumbled more than 20% this year. Well over $1 trillion has been wiped off the value of the most powerful tech companies.\n\nThe pandemic boom is well and truly over for the industry. Now rising interest rates are pulling investors away from the sector, Gene Goldman, the chief investment officer at Cetera Investment Management, said. Dealmaking has taken a hit, and tech initial public offerings pretty much didn't happen in 2022.\n\nThe consensus is that 2023 will be just as bad, or worse. Bloomberg reported Tuesday that 70% of economists in a monthly survey said they believed a recession would come in the first half of 2023.\n\nThe consensus may not be right on this one.\n\nAmazon doesn't think a recession is all that likely. Insider reported Thursday the Seattle company's economists saw just a 30% chance of a US recession in the next six months.\n\nThrough its giant e-commerce and cloud businesses, the company has unique insights into consumer and business activity. Here are some of the more surprising findings from Amazon's internal report:\n\nEveryone is worried about inflation. Yet Amazon's economists reckon this won't affect the company as much as other businesses. They expect the price of Amazon products to rise less than 3% next year and then drop in 2024.\n\nIf a recession does occur, Amazon economists don't think the company will endure much pain. The company gets about 60% of its revenue from higher-income consumers who are less affected by higher unemployment and other recessionary outcomes.\n\nLower-income consumers have been joining the company's e-commerce platform in recent years. That has helped Amazon grow, but these customers are more sensitive to an economic slowdown, and inflation chips away at more of their disposable income. So growth maybe a little harder to generate for Amazon in 2023.\n\nMuch of the economic pain in the tech industry is concentrated in unprofitable companies that can't stomach more interest-rate hikes. Amazon is not really in that camp. Neither are Meta, Google, Apple, or Microsoft.\n\nAnd Wall Street eggheads can get so caught up in inflation data that they miss the continued strength of the consumer. That's the engine that drives most of the US economy and a lot of Amazon's success. At this point, the two are closely intertwined, so here's to some relatively good news as we leave a tough 2022 behind and start fresh in January.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson shared a statement with Insider's Eugene Kim for the original story. We've included it in here too, at the company's request:\n\n\"The document in question does not reflect the company's position on the economy and where it's headed. Our CFO Brian Olsavsky shared our thinking on our most recent earnings call, and our CEO shared his thoughts in a Dec. 6 interview at the Dealbook event.

I'd like to share with you what my daily routine looks like as a baker's apprentice.\n\nMy day starts with a substantial breakfast, followed by a trip to the bakery where I begin my day by kneading and rolling out the dough. Then, I prepare a variety of baked goods that I put in the oven. Depending on the demand, I mainly bake white and rye bread, as well as various types of pastries, cakes, and cookies.\n\nThroughout the day, I'm deployed in various ways in the bakery. I often work in customer service, taking orders, and sometimes I'm involved in product presentations or other events for the company.\n\nAfter work, I usually do a short training session before heading home. There, I have some free time before I review my lesson plan before bed.\n\nThe apprenticeship has many benefits for me and brings me a lot of new knowledge about the bakery. I learn the basics of baking, how to make dough, and the different types of baked goods. Over time, I also develop a sense of what customers want and how to produce the best baked goods.\n\nIn addition, I learn how to sell baked goods properly and navigate the bakery. All these things are taught to me step by step in class, and I can apply what I've learned in practice.\n\nThe most important part of my training, however, is the vocational training. Here, I receive a monthly salary that includes the minimum wage, but also other allowances and premiums. This means I have enough money to support myself and can even build up some savings.\n\nAs a baker's apprentice, my daily routine is very varied, but also demanding. Despite this, I can be satisfied, because the efforts pay off, and at the end of my apprenticeship, I will be a real baker.", "label": "machine"}

The 46-year-old actress, who has been married to NBA icon Dwyane Wade since 2014, reflected on the challenges she faced in her first marriage.\n\nUnion, who tied the knot with producer Chris Howard in 2001, revealed that she had an extramarital affair during their relationship. She attributed her decision to stray to her naivety and a sense of entitlement to happiness.\n\n\"I felt like I deserved happiness,\" Union explained. \"I was like 'Well, what do I do? How do I do it?' I felt entitled to whatever happiness I could find.\"\n\nThe actress acknowledged that she was a selfish partner, citing multiple instances of narcissistic and selfish behavior. She did not disclose the identity of her extramarital partner but confirmed that the affair was not a long-term relationship.\n\nIn addition to discussing her infidelity, Union also opened up about her past struggles with drug use, specifically marijuana and cocaine, during her late teens and early twenties.\n\n\"I was a drugged out chaotic mess,\" Union said. \"I was doing drugs, I was partying, I was not showing up for work, I was stealing from work, I was doing all kinds of crazy stuff.\"\n\nUnion credited her discovery of her passion for acting in her thirties with saving her life and providing a healthy outlet for her energy.\n\n\"For me to find a place to channel my chaos and all of my energy, it was the best decision that I could have ever made,\" Union said.\n\nThe actress has since gone on to achieve significant success in her career, with a long list of credits including her role as a judge on America's Got Talent and her appearance in the film Breakin' All the Rules.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "It's been almost a year since Southwest Airlines received a substantial sum of money from the government to help the airline navigate the challenging times brought about by the pandemic.\n\nThe airline was praised for declining a massive loan from the US Treasury Department's bailout program, but shortly after, it received a significant cash injection to avoid applying for a loan. This injection was the largest single airline aid package provided through the CARES Act, accounting for nearly one-fourth of the total federal funding allocated to the airline industry.\n\nHowever, one year after receiving these funds, customers of Southwest Airlines are left wondering why their experience has gotten worse instead of better. \"It's a complete mess,\" said a frequent flyer who wished to remain anonymous. \"There's been no meaningful improvement in customer service, delays and cancellations seem more frequent, and the airline seems to be doing anything to avoid compensating customers for their troubles.\"\n\nThe airline's current struggles appear to be emblematic of the industry as a whole, as US airlines received a total of $64 billion from the CARES Act. Industrywide, the statistics are not encouraging. According to the US Department of Transportation, there were more than 45,000 flight cancellations in November 2020, an increase of almost 20 percent from the same period in 2019. Customer complaints have also jumped significantly, rising to 6,500 in October 2020 compared to around 2,500 in October 2019.\n\nThe situation at Southwest Airlines has been particularly dire. Last summer, the airline had the highest rate of canceled flights across the entire US aviation industry. In November, it reported 8,123 canceled flights, representing a 94 percent increase from November 2019.\n\nThe airline has also faced criticism for its handling of customer service issues. There have been numerous complaints of long wait times to speak to customer service agents, or not being able to reach them at all. Frequent flyers are often given priority and treated more courteously, but if a passenger has the misfortune of running into a problem at the airport, they can expect to be left in the lurch.\n\n\"If something goes wrong, like a missed flight, you're likely going to be on your own,\" the anonymous flyer said. \"The airline isn't going to make it right. They're not going to offer you an alternative flight or compensate you for the mistake.\"\n\nThe biggest criticism from customers is the airline's failure to meaningfully improve its service despite having received billions in taxpayer-funded aid. In the wake of Southwest's bailout, the Treasury Department put in place certain conditions on how the money could be used. These conditions included prohibiting stock buybacks, limiting executive pay increases, and requiring a commitment to retain employees.\n\nThe airline has met most of these conditions and has gone above and beyond in its commitment to employees, extending an equity stake in the company and raising wages. But when it comes to service, there has been no improvement. If anything, the airline's performance has worsened. The percentage of flights arriving on time has dropped significantly in recent months, from 82 percent in August to 66 percent in November.\n\nIn addition, many of Southwest's planes are now severely delayed and overcrowded, according to passenger accounts. And the airline has been increasingly preying on travelers by charging fees for seemingly minor inconveniences, like requesting a printout of a ticket or altering a reservation.\n\nThe airline's woes appear to be part of a larger trend across the industry, suggesting that the billions of dollars received from taxpayers was either not properly used or was simply not enough. It is unclear at this point how much more taxpayer money the airline industry will need to get back on its feet and improve service levels, but it is evident that a substantial amount is necessary. For now, passengers of Southwest Airlines, and the airline industry at large, must continue to suffer while they wait for the bailout to work its magic.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "-19\n\n(Reuters) - President Joe Biden stated on Saturday that he conveyed his concerns to Chinese President Xi Jinping regarding the management of the COVID-19 pandemic and the issues surrounding Hong Kong's autonomy.\n\nDuring his inaugural call with Xi, Biden was \"very clear\" in outlining areas of disagreement.\n\nThe 90-minute call, the first between the two countries' leaders since Biden took office on January 20, also touched on climate change and trade issues, according to a White House statement.\n\nBiden told reporters afterward that he sought to clarify the terms of the \"Phase One\" trade deal struck under his predecessor Donald Trump and made clear the U.S. would act against China if it did not comply with the agreement.\n\n\"I was very clear in pointing out the areas where we are concerned and the areas that we felt had not been addressed in the phase one trade agreement, including forced labor and other issues that we felt were required to be addressed,\" he said.\n\nThe former vice president also stated that he had \"pointed out to him our concern about the way in which the original COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan was handled, and the lack of transparency,\" adding that he had also raised concerns about Hong Kong.\n\n\"China's actions were having an adverse impact on its standing in the world,\" Biden said.\n\nTensions between the world's two largest economies have been on the rise over issues including alleged human rights abuses in China's far-western region of Xinjiang, its assertive claims to Taiwan, and its sweeping national security law for Hong Kong.\n\nXi, who congratulated Biden on taking office and expressed willingness to work together, called for mutual respect and echoed his longstanding demand that Washington stop interfering in what Beijing considers its internal affairs.\n\n\"He also reaffirmed his support for a one-China policy and for continued advancement of our relationship,\" the White House said.\n\nThe two leaders discussed \"adherence to the rules-based international system and their commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific,\" according to the statement.\n\nThey also talked about the Iran nuclear deal, with Biden vowing to bring the U.S. back into the 2015 agreement and work with China and other countries to \"address the full range of Iran's destabilizing activities.\"\n\nThe leaders did not directly discuss China's suppression of Uighur Muslims, but Biden \"made clear his deep concern\" about human rights violations and restrictions on religious freedom, the White House said.\n\nOn climate change, the two leaders spoke of \"the imperative for ambitious efforts to decarbonize the global economy and the importance of collaboration to protect the environment and promote the clean energy transition,\" the statement said.\n\nThe two sides agreed to maintain communication on the issues and to ensure high-level engagement, it said.\n\nThe two leaders did not directly speak about Taiwan during their first call, according to the White House. Washington and Beijing have no diplomatic ties and the U.S. views the self-ruled island as a vital part of its regional security strategy.\n\nThe U.S. move to support Taiwan has angered Beijing, which considers Taiwan a wayward province, and has triggered military deployments of Chinese warships and aircraft around the island in recent weeks.\n\nThe Biden administration has so far taken a largely measured tone on the issue, stressing that Washington's commitments to Taiwan remain rock-solid, while declining to disclose specifics on policy changes.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Aceh, Indonesia CNN \u2014\n\nHatemon Nesa weeps as she clings to her 5-year-old daughter, Umme Salima, at a rescue shelter in Indonesia\u2019s Aceh province. Their faces appear gaunt, their eyes sullen, after drifting for weeks at sea on a boat with little food or water.\n\n\u201cMy skin was rotting off and my bones were visible,\u201d Nesa said. \u201cI thought I would die on that boat.\u201d\n\nNesa also cries for her 7-year-old daughter, Umme Habiba, who she says she was forced to leave behind in Bangladesh \u2013 she couldn\u2019t afford any more than the $1,000 the traffickers demanded to transport her and her youngest child to Malaysia. \u201cMy heart is burning for my daughter,\u201d she said.\n\nNesa and Umme Salima were among around 200 Rohingya, members of a persecuted Muslim minority, who embarked on the dangerous voyage in late November from Cox\u2019s Bazar, a sprawling refugee camp in Bangladesh crowded with around a million people who fled alleged genocide by the Myanmar military.\n\nBut soon after they left, the engine cut out, turning what was supposed to be a 7-day journey into a month-long ordeal at sea, exposed to the elements in the open-topped wooden boat, surviving only on rainwater and just three days\u2019 worth of food.\n\nNesa said she saw starving men jump overboard in a desperate search for food, but they never returned. And she witnessed a baby die after being fed salt water from the sea.\n\nAs the weeks wore on, the passengers\u2019 families and aid agencies pleaded with governments in multiple countries to help them \u2013 but their cries were ignored.\n\nThen on December 26, the boat was rescued by Indonesian fishermen and local authorities in Aceh, according to the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR). Of the 200 or so people who boarded the boat, only 174 survived \u2013 around 26 died on the boat, or are missing at sea, presumed dead.\n\nBabar Baloch, an Asia spokesperson for the agency, said after a lull during Covid, the numbers of people fleeing are back to pre-Covid levels. Some 2,500 boarded unseaworthy boats last year for the journey, and as many as 400 of them died, making 2022 one of the deadliest years in a decade for Rohingya escaping Cox\u2019s Bazar.\n\n\u201cThese are literally death traps that once you get in \u2026 you end up losing your life,\u201d he said.\n\nUmme Habiba remains in Cox's Bazar, where she is unable to go to school. Courtesy Mohammed Rezuwan Khan\n\n\u2018We are starving. We are dying here\u2019\n\nNesa and Salima\u2019s journey began on November 25 from the overcrowded refugee camps in Cox\u2019s Bazar, where she said her children couldn\u2019t go to school, leaving her with little hope for their future.\n\nNesa said she had carried around two kilograms of rice for the journey, but shortly after the boat left the port, its engine died and they started drifting.\n\n\u201cStarving with no food, we saw a fishing boat nearby and tried to go close,\u201d she said, crying as she recalled the horror. \u201cWe jumped in the water to swim close to that boat but in the end, we could not.\u201d\n\nThe rickety wooden boat that carried Hatemon Nesa and her daughter, Umme Salima pictured in Aceh province, Indonesia. CNN\n\nDuring December, as the boat bobbed aimlessly in the Bay of Bengal, the UNHCR said it was spotted near India and Sri Lanka. But the agency said those countries \u201ccontinuously ignored\u201d its pleas for intervention.\n\nCNN has contacted the Indian and Sri Lankan Navies for comment but has not received a response. Last month, the Sri Lankan Navy said in a statement that its crews had made a \u201cstrenuous effort\u201d to rescue another boat carrying 104 Rohingya, including many women and children, who had fled Bangladesh.\n\nOn December 18, Nesa\u2019s brother, Mohammed Rezuwan Khan, who is in Cox\u2019s Bazar, shared with CNN an audio clip of a harrowing phone call he received from one of the refugees aboard Nesa\u2019s boat.\n\n\u201cWe are dying here,\u201d the man said via satellite phone, according to the recording. \u201cWe haven\u2019t eaten anything for eight to 10 days. We are starving.\u201d\n\nHatemon Nesa and her 5-year-old daughter Umme Salima at a shelter in Aceh province in Indonesia. CNN\n\nNesa said the boat\u2019s driver and another crew member jumped into the ocean to find food, but they never returned. \u201cI think they got eaten by fish in the sea,\u201d she said.\n\nTwelve other men entered the water, while holding onto a long rope attached to the boat to try to catch something to eat, but as others on the boat tried to pull them back in, the rope snapped, Nesa said. \u201cThey could not return to the boat.\u201d\n\nWhile all countries are bound by international law to rescue people in distress at sea, swift action is not always forthcoming \u2013 particularly where Rohingya refugees are concerned, according to Baloch, from the UNHCR.\n\n\u201cI think everyone will agree as human beings that we have the responsibility you want to save one life in distress, let alone hundreds of people dying,\u201d Baloch said. \u201c(Nearby states) have to act to save these desperate people. It has to be an action which is in coordination done collectively by all the states in the region.\u201d\n\nAn uncertain future\n\nNesa and Umme Salima were among the 174 emaciated survivors shown on video setting foot on land for the first time in weeks in late December, some immediately collapsing onto the sand of an Aceh beach, too weak to stand.\n\nThey are among the more fortunate ones \u2013 the UNHCR believes another 180 are presumed dead, lost at sea on another boat since early December, when the occupants stopped communicating with their families.\n\nThe survivors from Nesa\u2019s boat are now receiving medical care in Aceh, however it remains unclear what might happen to them in the coming weeks and months.\n\nRohingya refugees rest after being transferred to a temporary shelter following their arrival by a boat in Laweung, Aceh province on December 27, 2022. Chaideer Mahyuddin/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIndonesia is not party to the UN Refugee Convention and lacks a national refugee protection structure, according to the UNHCR.\n\nFor those found to be refugees, UNHCR will begin to look for one of a range of what solutions, including resettlement to a third country or voluntary repatriation, if a person is able to \u201creturn in safety and dignity.\u201d\n\nThis marks the start of a new chapter for the group of passengers, who have lived for years in overcrowded, unhygienic and unsafe refugee camps in Bangladesh, after fleeing decades of systematic discrimination, widespread brutality and sexual violence in their home country of Myanmar.\n\n\u201cStateless, persecuted, these Rohingya refugees have known little peace,\u201d said UNHCR\u2019s Baloch.\n\nMuch more needs to be done by the international community for the persecuted group, who suffer on a scale most cannot imagine, he added.\n\nFor Nesa, the hope remains that she might be reunited with her other daughter some day.\n\n\u201cI was about to die (in Bangladesh),\u201d she said. \u201cAllah gave me a new life \u2026 My children should get a proper education.

{"text": "'Nothing outside our walls matters' \u2014 TCU pulled off an all-time CFP stunner and is still hungry for more\n\nThey started the season with a new head coach and no ranking.\n\nThen they started winning games, sometimes on last-minute touchdowns or last-second, fire-drill kicks.\n\nThe more everyone expected them to lose, they found ways to win \u2014 8-0, 10-0, 12-0 \u2014 until the TCU Horned Frogs, little, old TCU was in the College Football Playoff. A once-afterthought program was representing a league, the Big 12, that was supposedly left for dead about 17 months ago.\n\nEven then, few believed. All week the Horned Frogs were told they were going to get run over by a behemoth of a Michigan offensive line. All week they were told they should be happy to be there, a plucky, underdog program fortunate to even get a chance to be on this stage.\n\nAll week they were told it was going to end.\n\nThen it didn\u2019t end.\n\n\u201cNothing outside of our walls matters,\u201d said Dee Winters, TCU linebacker extraordinaire.\n\nTCU 51, Michigan 45.\n\nMaybe this is what it took, maybe this is the kind of team that could survive such a wild shootout, a game that the Horned Frogs seemingly put away three or four times only to have the Wolverines climb up off the canvas and renew the fight.\n\nMaybe this is what was needed for the College Football Playoff, now in its ninth season and headed toward expansion, to produce the closest thing to a Cinderella as this cruelly top-heavy sport has known in a long, long time.\n\nTCU quarterback Max Duggan (15) has played a starring role in his team's magical season, and he made some key plays in TCU's thrilling 51-45 win over Michigan in Saturday's College Football Playoff semifinal. (Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nIt took everything. It took everyone.\n\nIt took cornerback Bud Clark intercepting Michigan\u2019s J.J. McCarthy in the first quarter and running it the other way for a touchdown. It took Winters doing the same in the third. It took two goal-line stands \u2014 one a snuffing out of a Philly Special, the other a fumble recovery after a controversial replay reversal.\n\nIt took four sacks by Dylan Horton and 13 tackles for a loss by the team (plus an intentional grounding penalty). It took three pass deflections by Tre\u2019Vius Hodges-Tomlinson and 150 yards rushing from Emari Demercado. It took two more rushing scores by quarterback Max Duggan, including a lower-the-shoulder barrel-in that set the physical tone as much as any teeth-rattling hit by the defense.\n\nStory continues\n\nTough? Physically and mentally TCU is tougher than maybe anyone can describe. The Horned Frogs have won 13 games this season and in many of them the other team was left wondering how in the world it lost. You can add Michigan to that list \u2014 although two pick-sixes is a well-worn strategy for defeat.\n\n\u201cI think all week we heard about Big Ten football and how they were going to line up and run over us,\u201d head coach Sonny Dykes said. \u201cWe did a great job stopping the run and forcing them to do some things they are less comfortable doing.\u201d\n\nDonovan Edwards broke a long one early, but otherwise averaged 2.95 yards per carry. That meant Michigan needed McCarthy to throw it 34 times, nearly 12 more than his per-game average. He completed just 20, not counting those two crushing interceptions.\n\nWhen the TCU offense seemed too slow late in the game, there was a brilliant 76-yard catch and run by Quentin Johnston. And when the defense appeared to tire, there was a final stuffing of Michigan in the last seconds.\n\nThere was plenty of controversy as well, and the inexcusable reversal of a Michigan touchdown will rankle those in Ann Arbor forever. But it was TCU who recovered a goal-line fumble on the next play. Besides, the Horned Frogs didn\u2019t make the calls, and plenty of bad ones went against them, too.\n\nTCU just rolled with it. The ups and downs, comebacks and momentum shifts.\n\n\u201cI think our guys did a great job staying neutral, not getting too high or too low,\u201d said Duggan, who went just 14-of-29 for 225 yards and threw two interceptions, yet never looked rattled.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s tough,\u201d Dykes said. \u201cNothing bothers him.

{"text": "After months and months of SARS-CoV-2 subvariant soup, one ingredient has emerged in the United States with a flavor pungent enough to overwhelm the rest: XBB.1.5, an Omicron offshoot that now accounts for an estimated 75 percent of cases in the Northeast. A crafty dodger of antibodies that is able to grip extra tightly onto the surface of our cells, XBB.1.5 is now officially the country\u2019s fastest-spreading coronavirus subvariant. In the last week of December alone, it zoomed from 20 percent of estimated infections nationwide to 40 percent; soon, it\u2019s expected to be all that\u2019s left, or at least very close. \u201cThat\u2019s the big thing everybody looks for\u2014how quickly it takes over from existing variants,\u201d says Shaun Truelove, an infectious-disease modeler at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a really quick rise.\u201d\n\nAll of this raises familiar worries: more illness, more long COVID, more hospitalizations, more health-care system strain. With holiday cheer and chilly temperatures crowding people indoors, and the uptake of bivalent vaccines at an abysmal low, a winter wave was already brewing in the U.S. The impending dominance of an especially speedy, immune-evasive variant, Truelove told me, could ratchet up that swell.\n\nBut the American public has heard that warning many, many, many times before\u2014and by and large, the situation has not changed. The world has come a long way since early 2020, when it lacked vaccines and drugs to combat the coronavirus; now, with immunity from shots and past infections slathered across the planet\u2014porous and uneven though that layer may be\u2014the population is no longer nearly so vulnerable to COVID\u2019s worst effects. Nor is XBB.1.5 a doomsday-caliber threat. So far, no evidence suggests that the subvariant is inherently more severe than its predecessors. When its close sibling, XBB, swamped Singapore a few months ago, pushing case counts up, hospitalizations didn\u2019t undergo a disproportionately massive spike (though XBB.1.5 is more transmissible, and the U.S. is less well vaccinated). Compared with the original Omicron surge that pummeled the nation this time last year, \u201cI think there\u2019s less to be worried about,\u201d especially for people who are up to date on their vaccines, says Mehul Suthar, a viral immunologist at Emory University who\u2019s been studying how the immune system reacts to new variants. \u201cMy previous exposures are probably going to help against any XBB infection I have.\u201d\n\nSARS-CoV-2\u2019s evolution is still worth tracking closely through genomic surveillance\u2014which is only getting harder as testing efforts continue to be pared back. But \u201cvariants mean something a little different now for most of the world than they did earlier in the pandemic,\u201d says Emma Hodcroft, a molecular epidemiologist at the University of Bern, in Switzerland, who\u2019s been tracking the proportions of SARS-Cov-2 variants around the world. Versions of the virus that can elude a subset of our immune defenses are, after all, going to keep on coming, for as long as SARS-CoV-2 is with us\u2014likely forever, as my colleague Sarah Zhang has written. It\u2019s the classic host-pathogen arms race: Viruses infect us; our bodies, hoping to avoid a similarly severe reinfection, build up defenses, goading the invader into modifying its features so it can infiltrate us anew.\n\nRead: How long can the coronavirus keep infecting us?\n\nBut the virus is not evolving toward the point where it\u2019s unstoppable; it\u2019s only switching up its fencing stance to sidestep our latest parries as we do the same for it. A version of the virus that succeeds in one place may flop in another, depending on the context: local vaccination and infection histories, for instance, or how many elderly and immunocompromised individuals are around, and the degree to which everyone avoids trading public air. With the world\u2019s immune landscape now so uneven, \u201cit\u2019s getting harder for the virus to do that synchronized wave that Omicron did this time last year,\u201d says Verity Hill, an evolutionary virologist at Yale. It will keep trying to creep around our defenses, says Pavitra Roychoudhury, who\u2019s monitoring SARS-CoV-2 variants at the University of Washington, but \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to have alarm-bell emojis for every variant that comes out.\u201d\n\nRead: The coronavirus\u2019s next move\n\nSome particularly worrying variants and subvariants will continue to arise, with telltale signs, Roychoudhury told me: a steep increase in wastewater surveillance, followed by a catastrophic climb in hospitalizations; a superfast takeover that kicks other coronavirus strains off the stage in a matter of days or weeks. Omens such as these hint at a variant that\u2019s probably so good at circumventing existing immune defenses that it will easily sicken just about everyone again\u2014and cause enough illness overall that a large number of cases turn severe. Also possible is a future variant that is inherently more virulent, adding risk to every new case. In extreme versions of these scenarios, tests, treatments, and masks might need to come back into mass use; researchers may need to concoct a new vaccine recipe at an accelerated pace. But that\u2019s a threshold that most variations of SARS-CoV-2 will not clear\u2014including, it seems so far, XBB.1.5. Right now, Hodcroft told me, \u201cit\u2019s hard to imagine that anything we\u2019ve been seeing in the last few months would really cause a rush to do a vaccine update,\u201d or anything else similarly extreme. \u201cWe don\u2019t make a new flu vaccine every time we see a new variant, and we see those all through the year.\u201d Our current crop of BA.5-focused shots is not a great match for XBB.1.5, as Suthar and his colleagues have found, at least on the antibody front. But antibodies aren't the only defenses at play\u2014and Suthar told me it\u2019s still far better to have the new vaccine than not.\n\nIn the U.S., wastewater counts and hospitalizations are ticking upward, and XBB.1.5 is quickly elbowing out its peers. But the estimated infection rise doesn\u2019t seem nearly as steep as the ascension of the original Omicron variant, BA.1 (though our tracking is now poorer). XBB.1.5 also isn\u2019t dominating equally in different parts of the country\u2014and Truelove points out that it doesn\u2019t yet seem tightly linked to hospitalizations in the places where it\u2019s gained traction so far. As tempting as it may be to blame any rise in cases and hospitalizations on the latest subvariant, our own behaviors are at least as important. Drop-offs in vaccine uptake or big jumps in mitigation-free mingling can drive spikes in illness on their own. \u201cWe were expecting a wave already, this time of year,\u201d Hill told me. Travel is up, masking is down. And just 15 percent of Americans over the age of 5 have received a bivalent shot.\n\nThe pace at which new SARS-CoV-2 variants and subvariants take over could eventually slow, but the experts I spoke with weren\u2019t sure this would happen. Immunity across the globe remains patchy; only a subset of countries have access to updated bivalent vaccines, while some countries are still struggling to get first doses into millions of arms. And with nearly all COVID-dampening mitigations \u201cpretty much gone\u201d on a global scale, Hodcroft told me, it\u2019s gotten awfully easy for the coronavirus to keep experimenting with new ways to stump our immune defenses. XBB.1.5 is both the product and the catalyst of unfettered spread\u2014and should that continue, the virus will take advantage again.", "label": "human"}

Aldi Einkauf GmbH & Co. oHG via Getty Images\n\nIn the aftermath of the war, \"scarcity and necessary frugality demanded the avoidance of waste,\" Dieter and Nils Brandes wrote in their book \"Bare Essentials: The Aldi Success Story.\"\n\n\"The principle was: less is better than too much. This applied to capital, personnel, size of stores,\" they continued.\n\nOver the years, the brothers opened dozens more stores. By 1954, there were 77 stores. Because of its below-average price model, Aldi was able to slowly dominate the market in Germany and its stores spread across Europe.\n\nThe brothers had a clear vision for the business. They decided to sell only non-perishable items that had a proven demand, and didn't want to spend money on decorations, advertising, or inventory that wasn't selling. What was surprising to shoppers at the time was the self-service nature of the store, introduced in the mid-1950s; customers were able to take products off the shelves themselves, in stark contrast to other retailers, where goods were generally kept behind the counter.\n\n\"We wanted our stores to be like other retail outlets, offering a wide range of groceries,\" Karl said in 1953, as quoted in \"Bare Essentials: The Aldi Success Story.\"\n\n\"But then we did not follow up on this after all, because we recognised that with our narrow range of products we could also run a successful business and that, compared with other businesses, our expenses remained very low and this was largely due to our narrow range of products.

{"text": "Image shows a pull figurine signifying a bull market. T. Rowe Price says investors should expect lower returns in the midterm.\n\nIn 2022 the S&P 500 had its worst annual first-half in five decades. With the tailwinds that buoyed global economies during the pandemic recovery gone, those who are saving for retirement should take several steps to weather the drop-off in stock and bond returns, including adding more growth-oriented assets to their portfolios, according to T. Rowe Price\u2019s 2022 U.S. Retirement Market Outlook.\n\nA financial advisor can help you plan for the future, including saving for retirement. Find a local advisor today.\n\nWhy Investors Can Expect Lower Returns\n\nImage shows a woman looking out a window. T. Rowe Price says investors should expect returns in the coming period to be lower than recent years.\n\nDespite the economic turmoil wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic, the stock market surged in 2021 to new heights since a mass sell-off in March 2020. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite climbed to all-time highs amid vaccine distributions and increased economic activity.\n\nThe stock market\u2019s recent run comes on the heels of the longest bull market in history, which spanned 2009 to 2020. Since 2009, the S&P 500 has only posted one losing year for total returns (2018). In fact, the index has posted total annual returns of more than 15% in seven of those 12 years. The index, which tracks the performance of 500 large public companies, was up more than 25% in 2021.\n\nBut the T. Rowe Price report, which was issued in the fall of 2021, warned of less robust returns.\n\n\u201cWe believe midterm returns will be lower than those seen in previous periods \u2013 in some cases considerably lower. This has significant ramifications for retirement plans and whom they benefit,\u201d the firm stated in its report.\n\nThe financial services firm first pointed to fixed-income markets and the near-historic low interest rates \u2013 now being raised by the Federal Reserve. That\u2019s a trend the firm expected to continue. As for the equity markets, \u201cWe expect returns in many large markets such as the U.S. to be restrained relative to recent history,\u201d it added. \u201cWhile valuations across asset classes vary, and some assets are attractively valued, the valuations of most assets are elevated on these measures.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nLastly, T. Rowe Price pointed to several risks that markets face, including inflation \u2013 which was at a 40-year high in June 2022. While fiscal stimulus, earnings growth and economic activity have all helped propel the pandemic recovery, inflationary fears were evident in late 2021. In October 2021, for example, the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers rose 6.2% compared to 12 months earlier, the largest increase since 1990.\n\nThe risks extend beyond U.S. markets. The T. Rowe Price report noted that China is facing supply chain disruptions and rising commodities prices. Elsewhere, virus mutations and vaccine rollout challenges may also hamper investment returns.\n\n\u201cWhile the global economy has been buoyed by a period of extreme liquidity driven by fiscal and monetary stimulus, these tailwinds are likely to fade as central banks begin to pursue more moderate policies,\u201d the report stated. \u201cAlthough these conditions may not materialize as significant headwinds for growth, we believe they contribute to a less compelling risk/reward profile going forward. Retirement investors will need to be positioned accordingly.\u201d\n\nHow Retirement Savers Can Respond\n\nImage shows a couple looking over their retirement investments. T. Rowe Price says investors should expect returns in the coming period that will be lower than recent years.\n\nInvestors who are saving for retirement have three options for meeting the challenge of lower-than-expected future returns:\n\nSave more or delay retirement: T. Rowe Price acknowledges this may be the \u201cleast attractive\u201d option, however saving more or simply delaying retirement can help offset lower returns. By delaying retirement, a person can reduce the number of years for which they\u2019ll need retirement income. Postponing retirement and working longer can also enable a person to claim Social Security later. Delaying Social Security beyond full retirement age will result in a larger benefit.\n\nAcquire more growth-seeking assets: The second option may mean increasing a portfolio\u2019s equity composition or introducing fixed-income securities that offer higher returns. This can lead to more risk, but a target date fund with a growth-oriented glide path may be a good option for doing so, especially for investors whose retirements are still years away, T. Rowe Price said.\n\nLimit spending in retirement: The third and final option is to limit spending in retirement. \u201cT. Rowe Price analysis of retirees\u2019 spending habits reveals that retirees tend to adjust their spending to their income,\u201d the report states. \u201cMost of the retirees who do adjust their spending have the means and flexibility to do so. The poorest households, however, cannot spend less.\u201d\n\nBottom Line\n\nAs the U.S. and other nations continue to wade through high inflation and a slowing economy, T. Rowe Price warns that investors should expect lower returns. To limit the impact of lower investment returns, those planning for retirement can simply save more or delay retirement. They can also add more growth-seeking assets to their portfolios, or adjust their spending habits in retirement.\n\nRetirement Planning Tips\n\nDo you know how much you\u2019ll need to have saved for retirement?

{"text": "As the job market undergoes transformations, companies are adjusting their strategies to keep pace. Unfortunately, this shift may not necessarily benefit job seekers.\n\nIn recent years, companies have placed greater emphasis on salary disclosure in job postings. While this transparency has provided job seekers with more information about potential salaries, it has inadvertently led to companies offering lower salaries.\n\nA recent study by PayScale, a research firm, discovered a decline in median salaries in the public job market since 2018. The study analyzed over 1 million job postings from 18,000 companies across the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, revealing a decrease in the median salary range for professional positions from $68,000 to $64,000.\n\nThis trend may be attributed to companies responding to the demand for salary transparency. Employers may be hesitant to reveal their true salary ranges, instead opting to present a lower range in job postings to maintain secrecy until the employee starts the job.\n\nAlternatively, employers might be using salary transparency to reduce their overall wage costs. By offering lower salaries, companies can save money.\n\nFor job seekers, this can be disheartening. Many assume the salary ranges listed in job postings are the true offers. However, companies can deflate their salary ranges for various reasons, leaving job seekers with a lower salary than expected.\n\nTo secure the best possible salary, it's essential to understand the market and conduct thorough research. Familiarize yourself with the job and industry, and determine a reasonable salary range. During the interview and negotiation process, emphasize your experience and knowledge to gain leverage and potentially secure a higher salary than the posted range.\n\nKeep in mind that salary transparency is a relatively new concept. As more companies adopt it, job postings may become more accurate, providing job seekers with a better understanding of realistic salaries. Until then, it's crucial to remain vigilant and conduct research to secure the best possible salary.", "label": "machine"}

Kecmanovic made a comeback in the second set, but Medvedev managed to break his opponent's serve in the sixth game and secure the win. Medvedev will face a tough challenge in the next round against Britain's Kyle Edmund, who has a history of victories against him. However, Medvedev is confident that he can make it further and is among the leading contenders for the title. He has already made it to the quarter-finals of the Australian Open and the semi-finals of the Brisbane International this year.", "label": "machine"}

Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor was born in Bruton Street, Mayfair, London on 21 April 1926. She married Prince Philip in 1947 and ascended the throne of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth on 6 February 1952 after the death of her Father, King George VI. Queen Elizabeth II died at Balmoral Castle in Scotland on September 8, 2022, and is succeeded by her eldest son, King Charles III. Jeff Spicer/Pool via REUTERS\n\nSummary Altercation in UK prince's upcoming book- Guardian\n\nHarry won't commit to attending father's coronation\n\nRoyal brothers have fallen out in recent years\n\nHarry's book \"Spare\" to be published next week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Britain's Prince Harry says in his much-awaited memoir that older brother and heir to the throne Prince William knocked him to the floor during a 2019 argument over Harry's American wife Meghan, the Guardian newspaper reported on Wednesday.\n\nThe altercation between the brothers, the sons of King Charles, is detailed in Harry's book \"Spare\" which is due to be published on Jan. 10, said the Guardian, stating it had obtained a leaked copy despite stringent security.\n\nThe report came as ITV released a clip of an upcoming interview with Harry ahead of the book's publication in which he said he could not commit to attending his father's coronation in May.\n\nAccording to the Guardian's account, the 2019 sibling brawl took place at Harry's London home arose after William called Meghan \"difficult\", \"rude\" and \"abrasive\", which Harry said sounded like \"the press narrative\" about his wife.\n\n\"He grabbed me by the collar, ripping my necklace, and he knocked me to the floor,\" Harry wrote, according to the paper.\n\n\"I landed on the dog's bowl, which cracked under my back, the pieces cutting into me. I lay there for a moment, dazed, then got to my feet and told him to get out.\"\n\nWilliam then challenged his younger brother to hit back but Harry refused. William later returned to the scene, \"looking regretful, and apologised\", Harry wrote, according to the extract, with his brother asking him not to tell Meghan that he had \"attacked\" him.\n\nSpokespeople for King Charles and Prince William declined to comment on the Guardian report.\n\nWilliam and Harry were once seen as very close after the death of their mother, Princess Diana, in a Paris car crash in 1997. But the brothers have fallen out since Harry married Meghan, a former actress, in 2018 and the couple then stepped down for royal duties to move to California two years later.\n\nSince their departure, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, as the couple are officially known, have delivered stinging criticism of the Windsors and the British monarchy which has included accusations of racism which William himself has dismissed.\n\nLast month, their six-part Netflix documentary, which attracted record audiences, aired with renewed accusations including that William had screamed at Harry during a crisis summit to discuss his future.\n\nThe main criticism from Harry and Meghan is that royal aides not only refused to hit back at hostile, inaccurate press coverage but were complicit in leaking negative stories to protect other royals, most notably William.\n\n\"I don't know how staying silent is ever going to make things better,\" Harry said in Thursday's ITV clip.\n\nAsked why he was invading the privacy of his family, something he had railed against, he replied: \"That will be the accusation from the people that don't understand or don't want to believe that my family have been briefing the press.\"\n\nHEIR AND A SPARE\n\nThe title of his book \"Spare\" comes from an oft-cited quote in British aristocratic circles about the need for an heir, and a spare. According to the Guardian extracts, King Charles reputedly said on the day Harry was born to Diana: \"Wonderful! Now you've given me an heir and a spare \u2013 my work is done.\"\n\nThe book also recounts \"intensely private scenes and conversations\", the Guardian reported, such as describing his memories and love of his mother, who was killed in a 1997 car crash, and grandmother Queen Elizabeth, who died last year at age 96.\n\nHarry has given two broadcast interviews ahead of the book's publication which are due to be shown on Sunday, with clips indicating he would return to complaints that Buckingham Palace had failed to protect him and his wife.\n\n\"They feel as though it's better to keep us, somehow, as the villains,\" Harry said in a trailer released by ITV.\n\nHow much the disclosures will resonate with the public is unclear. A YouGov poll this week found 65% of those surveyed were \"not interested at all\" in his upcoming book, while another found greater sympathy among respondents for William and his wife Kate than for Harry and Meghan.\n\nCharles himself is still hoping for a reconciliation with his son, unnamed sources told newspapers this week.\n\nIn its leaked extracts, the Guardian says the king had stood between his two sons during a difficult meeting at Windsor Castle following the April 2021 funeral for their grandfather Prince Philip, the late queen's husband.\n\n\"Please, boys,\" Harry quoted his father as saying. \"Don\u2019t make my final years a misery.\"\n\nEditing by Angus MacSwan and Nick Macfie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The Federal Trade Commission is scrutinizing Microsoft's massive acquisition of Activision Blizzard, hinting that the US regulatory body might block the $7.5 billion deal.\n\nThe news, announced Monday, comes as Microsoft reportedly edges closer to acquiring Activision Blizzard, the world's largest game publisher, and parent company of popular titles like Overwatch, Call of Duty, and Diablo. If approved, the deal would be the largest purchase of a video game publisher in the industry's history, surpassing Tencent's $3.8 billion acquisition of Riot Games in 2011.\n\nThe FTC started its review of the Microsoft-Activision Blizzard deal over the summer, shortly after the proposal was announced. In a statement, the FTC said its review aims to determine whether the transaction will likely substantially lessen competition or be anticompetitive in any market or markets.\n\nIndustry observers believe that the FTC will likely conclude that Microsoft is using its market dominance and financial resources to acquire a major competitor in the gaming space, reducing competition and increasing prices for consumers. Microsoft is a giant in both the gaming industry and the broader tech industry, with a market capitalization of nearly $2 trillion as of Monday.\n\nExperts also warn that the Microsoft-Activision Blizzard merger could be detrimental to smaller independent game developers. The combination of two major players could create an environment of even greater consolidation, where larger game publishers can pressure smaller developers with the threat of pulling their games from the shelves.\n\nIn response to questions from CNN, Microsoft stated that the deal is \"pro-consumer\" and \"will bring more choice, value, and innovation to the gaming industry.\" Microsoft also expressed confidence that the FTC will approve the acquisition.\n\nHowever, other tech giants have faced FTC action against them for acquisitions. For instance, the FTC blocked Google's acquisition of travel information company ITA Software in 2011, citing concerns that the deal would enable Google to monopolize the market for airline flight search services.\n\nThe FTC is expected to make a decision on the Microsoft-Activision Blizzard merger within the next several months. If it approves the deal, it will be a significant victory for Microsoft and Activision Blizzard, which had been struggling with sluggish growth.\n\nThe gaming industry is undergoing rapid changes, and Microsoft is no stranger to disruption. In 2016, the tech giant announced plans to launch its own game streaming service, Project xCloud, enabling gamers to play on the go. That service launched in the US and UK this October.\n\nThe timing of Microsoft's move to acquire Activision Blizzard is strategic, too. In the next few years, the industry is expected to undergo a massive shift as next-generation consoles arrive and as streaming technology revolutionizes the gaming experience. Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard could give it the upper hand in this rapidly evolving environment.\n\nEven if the FTC ultimately approves the merger, the move could come at a cost to competition. The deal is likely to draw criticism from consumer advocacy groups, who have long argued that deals such as this are anticompetitive and lead to higher prices for consumers.\n\nHowever, antitrust experts say that the FTC's review of the deal is likely to be an open-and-shut case. The acquisition of Activision Blizzard could lead to a near-monopoly of the gaming industry, and the Commission is likely to conclude that the deal is not in the best interest of consumers.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "As global travel restrictions have been lifted, travelers are eager to take advantage of countries reopening their borders. One such country is China, which has announced the reopening of some destinations for international travelers starting from January 2021.\n\nThe Chinese government has specified that travelers from certain countries can enter the country with a valid visa or proof of a negative COVID-19 test, in addition to taking a quarantine period upon arrival. The government has also emphasized that the primary criterion for entry into China is meeting the health and safety requirements stated.\n\nThe news of China reopening its borders has been welcomed by travelers eager to return to the country, as well as those keen to visit it for the first time. Travel enthusiasts are excited to explore the country's cultural heritage, including the Great Wall, and experience Chinese culture.\n\nThe reopening of Chinese borders is also generating interest from the travel and tourism industry. Many tourism companies are taking advantage of the situation and offering travel packages that cater to travelers from different countries.\n\nThe travel industry is working hard to ensure that customers have the best experience possible, with the best hotels, attractions, and activities available in the country. Companies are also offering COVID-19 insurance packages to provide medical coverage and other necessary services should travelers become infected while on their trip.\n\nThe news of China's reopening is a boon to airlines, hotels, and other businesses associated with travel and tourism. With the number of international travelers set to increase, the Chinese travel industry is expecting to see a huge boost in economic activity. This can potentially create thousands of jobs in the country as businesses ramp up in anticipation of an influx of tourists.\n\nWhile the reopening of Chinese borders is a cause for celebration, it also means that travelers must be especially careful when traveling to the country. The Chinese government has been strict in enforcing safety protocols, and travelers must adhere to the regulations set forth by the authorities.\n\nFor travelers planning to go to China, it is essential to stay up to date with the news and ensure that they have all the necessary documents and tests required for entry. It is also recommended that travelers purchase comprehensive travel insurance to cover their expenses in case of any unexpected events.\n\nOverall, the reopening of Chinese borders marks the start of a new era for the country, and the hope that travelers will soon be able to experience the wonders of China once again.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Razors\n\nDoes a simple manual razor count as a gadget? Well, with the more desirable razors on the market boasting features like multiple blades and lubricating strips, the answer is yes. But listener Tim wants to know, do all the advertised fancy features, multiple blades and higher price tags really make a difference to your shave?\n\nSome shaving brands claim to have superior blades coated in chromium, or shaped like a 'gothic arch', but consultant dermatologist Dr Bav Shergill says the single most important feature is that the blade is \"really sharp\".\n\nMany of the more expensive razors have five blades. Dr Frauke Neuser from Gillette says the point of multiple blades is that you're cutting each hair multiple times, achieving a closer shave. But the main driver for more blades is actually comfort. It spreads the pressure, which means \"less skin bulging, less tug and pull, and an easy glide\".\n\nAre there benefits to lubricating strips? Bav isn\u2019t convinced. \"You're already hopefully putting a lubricant on your face with the shaving oil or shaving gel,\" he flags. But Frauke insists that the added lubrication is for when you take a second stroke, so you \"still get that protection and the easier glide\".\n\nGillette Labs Exfoliating Razor is 75 times the cost of a Bic disposable razor. Is it worth it? \"It's the engineering that goes into them,\" Frauke claims. \"Durability also plays a big role.\" Bav agrees that it is worth splashing out \u2013 on more blades and bells and whistles \u2013 because, as you're essentially doing a cosmetic treatment every time you shave, ease of use is key. That doesn't, however, mean you need to go absolutely top of the range.\n\nAnd a 'closer shave' isn\u2019t for everyone. This can actually lead to ingrowing hairs and irritation. If you have sensitive skin, five blades may not be for you. And perhaps avoid 'exfoliating bars', as these could irritate the skin further.\n\nElectric toothbrushes\n\nManual toothbrush user Holly got in touch to ask if an electric brush would save her costly trips to the dentist. And will a more expensive model really clean her teeth better?\n\nThe big players in the market are Oral-B and Philips. Oral-B's toothbrush heads oscillate at about 70 times a second. Philips's brushes use vibrations, with the bristles moving side to side at high speed. \"In terms of the different technologies, there\u2019s not a lot in it,\" says Damien Walmsley, Professor of Restorative Dentistry.\n\nPrices can be eyewatering: Oral-B's top brush \u2013 the iO9 \u2013 retails at \u00a3500. In this price range, brushes come with features like apps that feedback on your brushing technique. Paying more may also get you a longer battery life, suggests Which? researcher Matt Knight.\n\nHowever, when Which? rated numerous electric models, they found that there was no direct link between price and the quality of the clean. \"I'd be aware of the claims the toothbrush will clean your teeth better, because in many cases we found that isn\u2019t necessarily the case,\" says Matt.\n\nIn terms of the cleaning properties of manual versus electric, Damien thinks that there is very little difference between the two. But manual toothbrushing does rely on good technique so electric toothbrushes remove the room for human error. Whether the snazzy apps (and associated price hike) will be a help or a hindrance is down to you.", "label": "human"}

Overall spending got a boost from key shopping holidays that typically bring the deepest discounts. Online sales during Cyber Week, the five-day period from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, totaled about $35.3 billion.\n\nVivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, said the script has flipped from the previous year.

Inflation rose less than expected in November, but was still up 7.1% year over year, according to the Labor Department.\n\nOnline retailers have gotten price-sensitive customers to press the \"buy\" button with steep promotions. Prices dropped on major retailers' websites during the holidays, and discounting levels were deeper than ever, according to Adobe.\n\nToy discounts peaked at 34% off listed price during the holiday season, up from 19% in the year-ago period. Electronics discounts peaked at 25%, up from 8% in the year-ago period. And apparel peaked at 19%, up from 13% a year ago.\n\nComputers, TVs, appliances and sporting goods were also more promotional, Adobe found.\n\nAccording to Adobe's Digital Price Index, which tracks e-commerce prices across 18 categories, prices online have been falling year over year since September. That means the 3.5% increase was driven by net new demand rather than fueled by inflated prices.\n\nPandya said the deep discounts likely helped retailers sell off the glut of merchandise that had piled up in warehouses and store backrooms. Many retailers, including Target , Walmart and Kohl's , have faced a jump in inventory levels as popular Covid pandemic categories fell out of favor and inflation weighed on household budgets.\n\nIn a separate report, which includes in-store spending, holiday sales rose 7.6% in stores and online from Nov. 1 to Dec. 24, according to data from Mastercard SpendingPulse. The figure includes all forms of payment and restaurant spending. It is not adjusted for inflation.\n\nOnline sales have become a more meaningful part of holiday spending because of the pandemic, but most sales still take place at stores.\n\nE-commerce drove 21.6% of total retail sales over the holidays this year, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse. It's a slight increase over the holiday seasons in 2021 and 2020, when e-commerce made up 20.9% and 20.6% of total sales, respectively, but a notable jump from the same period in 2019 when it accounted for 14.6% of sales.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "On the crystal-clear waters of Indiana, remarkable catches can effortlessly be achieved.\n\nIn mid-January, a new Indiana state record for burbot (Lota lota) was established when a 9.19-pound burbot was caught in the Patoka River in southwestern Indiana. It was the largest burbot ever reeled in in the Hoosier State.\n\nThe fish was landed by Brian Hines, a seasoned angler who has been fishing in Indiana and neighboring states for 15 years.\n\n\"I was fishing with friends and we had been casting lures and topwater baits, but nothing was yielding results,\" Hines said.\n\n\"So I decided to switch to bottom fishing, and that's when I hooked into the record-breaking burbot.\"\n\nHines immediately recognized it was a large fish, but he had no idea it was a record-breaker.\n\n\"I had no idea how big it was until I got it in the boat and we weighed it,\" he said.\n\nThe record-breaking burbot had a length of 26 inches and a girth of 17.5 inches. It's the fourth-largest burbot ever recorded in Indiana. The current state record for burbot is a 9.80-pounder caught on the Wabash River in December, 2014.\n\n\"It was an incredible experience and definitely one I won't forget,\" Hines said.\n\nBurbot, also known as freshwater cod or lawyer, are a species of codfish found in the Northern Hemisphere. They inhabit cool and deep waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic Oceans.\n\nIn Indiana, burbot are found in the Maumee, Ohio, Wabash, St. Joseph, and Patoka rivers. They're most commonly caught by anglers fishing the deep pools and areas of slow-moving water in rivers.\n\nTo keep a record-breaking burbot, anglers must submit an application to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR). The fish must be weighed and measured on a certified scale and a photograph must be taken as proof.\n\nThe current state record for burbot was also caught in the Patoka River. It was reeled in by Michael Mayo in December, 2014. Mayo's burbot weighed 9.80 pounds and had a length of 24.5 inches.\n\nAlthough record-breaking catches don't happen every day, the waters of Indiana can easily produce big fish. Anglers can easily find several species of fish, including bass, walleye, catfish, and even muskie.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a chance to break an Indiana record, get out and start fishing.

The bank identified the biotech stocks, as well as some medical technology companies, as part of its thematic investing picks, on themes it says are related to a \"transforming world.\" BofA listed the stocks under themes such as ageing, obesity and pandemic. Under the pandemic theme, the bank referred to \"disease X\" \u2014 a term that has surfaced following Covid-19 referring to the next unknown pandemic that could hit the world \u2013 adding that there are stock opportunities across vaccines, testing, ventilators and work-from-home practices.

In ageing, BofA highlights the potential of the \"silver economy\" and says there's $15 trillion baby boomer spending power in the U.S. alone, with opportunities across health care, aged care, and consumer sectors. The bank added medical technology firm Silk Road Medical , along with biotech firms Cerevel and Denali , to its list of stocks to play this theme. The issue of obesity also presents opportunities across pharmaceutical, healthy eating and wellness, according to BofA.

{"text": "The prolonged period of low inflation in the global economy has been a significant factor for over a decade, but experts are now noticing signs that this trend may be shifting. This could be a positive development for investors who have been hesitant to invest in bonds, as higher inflation levels could make them more appealing.\n\nThe global economic recovery from the pandemic has been characterized by weak inflationary pressures, as central banks have maintained a loose monetary policy and fiscal stimulus has had limited impact. However, as vaccine distribution accelerates and more countries return to normal, analysts predict a gradual resurgence of inflation.\n\nAs inflation rises, bonds may regain their appeal to investors. Historically, bonds tend to benefit from rising inflation expectations, as higher inflation leads to higher yields on longer-term bonds. Although central bank actions have weakened this relationship in recent years, if inflation continues to increase, this could present an opportunity for investors seeking yield.\n\nOne area of the bond market that may benefit significantly from higher inflation is the \"distressed\" bond play. These bonds have been sold off over the past year or so as the economic outlook has deteriorated and investors have become more risk-averse. High-yield bonds have been particularly hard hit, as companies have experienced revenue declines due to the pandemic.\n\nHowever, these bonds may now be an attractive option for investors, as their prices may recover if inflation expectations begin to rise. This is especially true for longer-dated high-yield bonds, which are more exposed to inflation risk than shorter-dated bonds. This means that investors may be able to capitalize on higher yields and benefit from any potential price appreciation in these bonds.\n\nIt is essential to acknowledge the risks associated with investing in these distressed bond plays. They are high-risk investments and can result in losses if the inflation backdrop does not materialize or if the economic recovery takes a downturn. Nonetheless, these bonds may present a potentially attractive option for investors seeking yield, and for those willing to assume the risk of a distressed bond play, it could be an opportunity worth considering.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Humans last set foot on the moon 50 years ago. Now we\u2019re going back, but the way we explore space has gone through some big changes.\n\nIn December of 1972, the astronaut Eugene Cernan left his footprints and daughter\u2019s initials in the lunar dust. In doing so, he became the last man to set foot on the moon. Now, after 50 years, humanity is going back. But in the half century since Apollo 17, a lot has changed in how we explore space\u2014and how we see our place in it.\n\nWhile those early missions were all run by governments, much of modern spaceflight is the domain of billionaires and their private companies. Commercial space travel has brought a new way of thinking about trips outside Earth\u2019s gravity, with tourism turning space into a vacation and something of a status symbol. It\u2019s also widened the range of people who go to space from the clean-cut white male astronauts of the Apollo era.\n\nNew visitors bring new perspectives to space, and that diversity could well change our relationship to it. A year ago, at 90 years old, the actor William Shatner rode one of Jeff Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin spacecraft. But as he told staff writer Marina Koren, his time in space didn\u2019t line up with the optimism of Star Trek\u2019s Captain Kirk.\n\nKoren and fellow staff writer Adam Harris discuss our changing relationship with space on an episode of the podcast Radio Atlantic. They also listen to some of Koren\u2019s interview with Shatner. You can hear their conversation here:\n\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\n\nAdam Harris: This is Radio Atlantic. I\u2019m Adam Harris.\n\nMarina Koren: And I\u2019m Marina Koren.\n\nHarris: This week on the show, we\u2019re talking about space. We just heard some of our colleagues\u2019 kids talking about space. As a parent myself, it feels like the images of space are inescapable. One of the first T-shirts I remember buying for my daughter was a NASA T-shirt. We have blankets in our house that have moons and rocket ships on them. Is that your recollection of childhood?\n\nKoren: Definitely. I had those glow-in-the-dark stars on my ceiling. Occasionally one would fall off and spook me, but I recently got a set for my 3-year old nephew. This is a go-to source of wonder and excitement for kids, for sure.\n\nHarris: And I should say that we are both staff writers, but you are the one on the space beat.\n\nKoren: Yes, I am The Atlantic\u2019s outer space bureau chief.\n\nHarris: (Laughs.) And it\u2019s been a big year to be a space reporter, right?\n\nKoren: It has, yeah! We are definitely in this strange new era of exploration. It\u2019s been 50 years since the last time human beings have set foot on the moon. 1972 was Apollo 17, the final moon landing.\n\nI think the universe is a lot more familiar to us now, because we\u2019ve come such a long way. But something that\u2019s really different now is that you have commercial companies that are doing the work that was traditionally done by governments. There\u2019s SpaceX, Elon Musk\u2019s company, and Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos\u2019s venture.\n\nAnd even 10 years ago, if you told someone that SpaceX will be launching people to the International Space Station, they might have laughed at you. It seemed ridiculous, but this is the reality now.\n\nIt feels like we\u2019re in this strange sci-fi future where space travel is something you can buy. It\u2019s a type of vacation. And it\u2019s become a status symbol in a way.\n\nBut now people can go to space and come back and tell everyone: \u201cWell, I\u2019ve been to space. I\u2019ve done something that only about 600 or so people have done in the history of humankind.\u201d\n\nHarris: Before private space travel, [when you think of people going to space,] you think of folks like John Glenn or Buzz Aldrin. It\u2019s someone with military training who has studied to be an astronaut like their entire life. What does it mean that that\u2019s no longer the only type of person that\u2019s going into space?\n\nKoren: I think that spaceflight is about to get really, really interesting because the stories that we\u2019ve heard from spacefarers have come from a specific group of people. These were, more often than not, white men with military backgrounds, trained in a certain workplace culture that values \u201cthe Right Stuff.\u201d It values being stoic and unafraid in the face of something dangerous.\n\nBut in this new era of commercial spaceflight, you\u2019re gonna be seeing a wide range of participants. There will hopefully be more women, more people of color, people from underrepresented groups, from different educational and socioeconomic backgrounds, and people with just a wide range of experiences.\n\nHarris: And what are the stories that we\u2019ve already heard about the experiences in space, right? These professional astronauts, when they come back, what do they say space was like?\n\nKoren: Yeah, there are a few common themes. So people, when these astronauts have gone to space and they\u2019ve seen Earth from that perspective, they have been overcome with emotion at the beauty of Earth. And it suddenly becomes very clear just how thin our atmosphere is. And that is the only thing that really protects our planet from everything else. They\u2019re struck by the fragility of the planet.\n\nAnd then something else also happens to a lot of astronauts when they go to space\u2014they suddenly feel a sense of connectedness with their fellow human beings down below. Because from space, you can\u2019t see any national borders. It\u2019s just continents and seas and clouds. And so, many astronauts have come home and described these feelings. And the stories are indicative of a cognitive shift, almost, that is known as \u201cthe overview effect.\u201d\n\nAnd I\u2019ve talked to astronauts who say that they were taken aback by the borderless world and how beautiful it is, how it made them feel like: Why are we at war? Why is there conflict? We\u2019re one planet. It made them feel whole.\n\nI\u2019ve also talked to one academic who did an extensive study of astronauts\u2014and she couldn\u2019t reveal this astronaut\u2019s name to me\u2014but she said that this person, when he went into space, he took one look out the window and was convinced that humanity was going to destroy itself in some hundred-number of years. And so that experience could be profound and inspiring to one person, but it could also actually make another feel despair.\n\nAnd what\u2019s happening now with space tourism and private spaceflight is that the people going into space now have heard these stories of the overview effect. It\u2019s a thing. And so they\u2019re expecting to feel a certain way when they go to space. They\u2019re expecting to have a profound change on their perspective of the world, and even maybe on their personalities. And so I wonder if we\u2019re kind of over-hyping that. And I have talked to a few professional NASA astronauts who agree. They worry that these spaceflight companies and their sales pitches to customers are overselling the effects of the overview effect. It\u2019s not a guarantee. It\u2019s not a gift from the universe. It\u2019s something that a person experiences and feels individually. And your mileage will vary.\n\nHarris: Yeah. And you said these flights are like a couple of minutes. Is that enough time to change you?\n\nKoren: That is a great question. So I talked to Frank White, the author who coined the term \u201cthe overview effect.\u201d He came up with it when he was flying on a plane\u2014so, not in space, but he had a pretty good view\u2014and he got to thinking: Future generations of humans who might be living and working in space would have this distant view of Earth all the time. And they would have these insights that regular earthbound people lack.\n\nAnd he was surprised that people who were flying on Blue Origin and having a few minutes of weightlessness were coming home and talking as if they had had this profound experience. They were saying it changed them. And he was surprised because he thought that in order to really get the full hit of the overview effect, you had to spend some time in space. Weeks to months in orbit around Earth, or even all the way out on the moon.\n\nSo, that\u2019s kind of the literature that we\u2019re working with here. And I think that\u2019s what\u2019s going to change in this era of commercial spaceflight, because you are going to have people who are not like the Apollo astronauts. And they\u2019re going to be coming home with different stories and really widening the overview effect that we\u2019ve become familiar with as a public.\n\nAnd the future participants won\u2019t be restricted by some of the constraints that the professional astronauts were. If you were a professional astronaut and you went to space and you didn\u2019t have a great time, I don\u2019t think you could say that once you came back from space, because that could potentially affect your future flight assignments. You had to have a certain response on your way home. And so I think we\u2019re about to hear some of the most honest stories of spaceflight that we\u2019ve ever heard before.\n\nHarris: Is the overview effect real? If we only have this limited pool of stories to pull from, is that theory a real thing? Have all of the folks who have gone up to space shared that view?\n\nKoren: That\u2019s a great question. And I think the way we talk about the overview effect, it becomes like this mystical, magical thing. Astronauts are revered people. Even when I\u2019ve interviewed astronauts, when they walk into the room in their full flight suits with all their mission patches on the fabric, you can\u2019t help but feel intimidated. Because you think: Wow, this person has seen something that I\u2019ve never seen.\n\nAnd so we think of the overview effect and the experience that people should have in space as something that the universe gives us. But it\u2019s actually a cultural phenomenon. It has been shaped by a certain group of people working under a certain set of pressures who wanted to make sure that they could fly again.\n\nSo they couldn\u2019t say anything outrageous. And the overview effect also came out of a certain time and place. Many of these stories come from the midst of the space race, in the middle of the Cold War. That definitely shapes a person\u2019s perspective. So I would say that seeing Earth from space is not a one-size-fits-all reaction.\n\nHarris: What are some of the interviews that stuck out because they may have differed from this idea of an overview effect?\n\nKoren: So I spoke with William Shatner about his space flight. He was 90 years old when he took that trip. I recorded some of my conversation with Shatner. And he said it was a really transformational experience, but not for the reasons that we\u2019re used to hearing.\n\nHarris: So you got to talk to Captain Kirk?\n\nKoren: I did, yes! I will admit: I have never seen Star Trek before.\n\nHarris: So we have a space reporter who\u2019s never seen Star Trek?\n\nKoren: (Laughs.) I haven\u2019t. But you\u2019ve seen it, right?\n\nHarris: I have seen Star Trek. It was playing pretty frequently on our TVs when I was a kid. My dad rarely missed episodes or reruns. [But] for people like Marina who don\u2019t know who Captain Kirk is: He\u2019s the captain of the starship Enterprise on Star Trek in the 1960s. The original captain. And he was this really optimistic figure\u2014this really sort of classical hero. [But] what did Shatner have to say about going to space? Actually being there?\n\nKoren: When I talked to him, it was about a year after his experience, and the flight was still really fresh in his mind. I asked him how he was feeling a year out, and he dove right into a Shatner-esque monologue about going to space.\n\nWilliam Shatner: We had emerged from the film of air that surrounds the Earth, and we\u2019re weightless. I got out of my five-point harness and made my way to the window. I saw a wake of air. Like a submarine might leave in the water.\n\nAnd then I looked to my right, which was facing space. When I looked up there, I saw nothing but blank, palpable space. The blackness was so overwhelming. My immediate thought was: My God, that\u2019s death.\n\nAnd then I looked back, and I could see with great clarity the beginning of the circumference line of the Earth. The color of the desert that I had just left, which was beige. The whiteness of the clouds. The blueness of the air. And those three colors in deference to the blackness\u2014I was overwhelmed by the sense of death and overwhelmed by the sense-nurturing by the Earth.\n\nKoren: When Shatner came back from his quick trip to space, he\u2019s standing outside the capsule; there\u2019s other people around him. Jeff Bezos is there. Bezos is popping champagne like a frat boy. And Shatner is just standing there, super still.\n\nShatner: I didn\u2019t know what I was feeling, but I was weeping, and I didn\u2019t know why. Everybody else was celebrating. It took me a couple of hours sitting by myself to understand that what I was feeling was grief. And the grief for the Earth.\n\nKoren: He is overcome with emotion. He is weeping, and then he starts saying how he was just taken aback by the blackness of space, the ugliness of space, how it looked like death.\n\nSo Shatner was super, super honest about his experience. And when I talked to him, he said that that grief was still with him. Earth was beautiful and gleaming and delicate from that perspective, but it just reminded him of everything that\u2019s wrong on the ground and particularly made him think about how unstoppable climate change feels.\n\nAnd so for him, this was in many ways a negative experience. And Shatner was starting to cry when we were talking about it, because the experience is so fresh in his mind and nothing about climate change and the prognosis there has really changed in the last year since he went to space. So that grief was still with him.\n\nHarris: How was his experience different from what he may have imagined that he would feel after going up to space?\n\nKoren: He told me that he expected to see Earth and just be reminded of how beautiful and wonderful this planet is. I think he expected it to be reaffirming in a positive way. And it\u2019s interesting to think of this man who played a character who was this really big space optimist in real life going to space, and his initial emotional reaction to that is grief and sadness and all kinds of negative emotion.\n\nI think what Shatner shares with other astronauts is: When people have gone to space, they have felt an overwhelming desire to take care of the planet. You really see that this is all there is. This is all we know, at least. And if this is our one home on this floating ball of rock in the void, then we should take care of it.\n\nAnd so, you know, there\u2019s a case to be made that the more people go up into space, that feeling will trickle down and lead to some type of meaningful improvement on Earth.\n\nHarris: If somebody gives you a ticket on a $20 million flight, you\u2019re not gonna be able to say, \u201cWell, that wasn\u2019t exactly what I expected it to be.\u201d But Shatner was able to do something different. Why was his experience different from others who have been up to space and came back down and just said, \u201cOh, it was great. Thanks, Jeff Bezos, for putting me on this flight\u201d?\n\nKoren: I mean, William Shatner is William Shatner, right? He was 90 years old during his space flight. He\u2019s Captain Kirk. I think he doesn\u2019t owe Jeff Bezos anything. Yes, Bezos comped his ticket, and that\u2019s lovely. But someone like William Shatner going into space can come back and say what they want, because the public looks at them in a different way. If a very wealthy person decides to comp the tickets for an electrician [or] for a nurse, and they go up and come down, can they speak their minds very freely? I don\u2019t know.\n\nHarris: Say a billionaire called you up and was like: \u201cHey, Marina, love your stories. You wanna go to space?\u201d Would you go if you got the opportunity?\n\nKoren: Oh man, well, there would be some conversation about journalistic ethics. But would I ever go to space? I\u2019m gonna say no.\n\nHarris: Really?\n\nKoren: Because spaceflight is risky. You never know what might happen, what could happen. I don\u2019t wanna die on the job not having filed my story. Like, if something happens\u2014if I\u2019m somehow incapacitated, I come back and I can\u2019t write the story\u2014that will haunt me. (Laughs.)\n\nPlanes freak me out. I still can\u2019t believe that we can get planes off the ground and land them back in one piece. And, you know, space is not at that level yet, but maybe someday it will be. And that\u2019s pretty wild to think about.\n\nHarris: Actually, to that point, thousands of people fly at high altitudes every day. Do you think that there\u2019s a future where spaceflight is going to feel as sort of commonplace as taking a flight to LaGuardia?\n\nKoren: I think that future is possible. I think what we have to be careful about is making too many promises. If you listen to Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos talk about spaceflight right now, they\u2019re suggesting that this future is happening, like, next week. And I don\u2019t think that future will happen that quickly. It\u2019s true that more people than before are going to have the opportunity to go to space now. I\u2019m not sure if in my lifetime there are going to be spaceships full of people going to the moon.\n\nI mean, there might be. SpaceX and Elon Musk are working really, really hard to make that future reality. SpaceX\u2019s next-generation moon rocket could reach orbit as early as next year. SpaceX has already sold tickets to people to go on a trip around the moon. These things are happening. How quickly they become reality, I don\u2019t know. Maybe 50 years from now when we\u2019re a hundred years out from the Apollo-program anniversary, maybe it will feel a bit more mundane, just like a plane ride.\n\nHarris: Is some of the mystique fading from space, or space travel? Are we sort of becoming desensitized to space travel? Those first couple of commercial flights, it was all 24-hour news cycle. They broadcast all of them. But that sort of slowed down. Are we sort of becoming desensitized to the awe and wonder of space travel?\n\nKoren: I think that\u2019s possible. I think of the Earthrise picture taken by the Apollo 8 crew in 1968. That picture was mind-blowing to people. They\u2019d never seen Earth like this before. Fifty years later, I think our brains are so spoiled by special effects that I do wonder if the sight of Earth from space is going to be that shocking. Especially when you have so many people going into orbit and coming back and posting on Instagram like: \u201cHere\u2019s what it looks like.\u201d I do wonder if we\u2019ve seen so much incredible CGI, if our modern brains might be less impressed by the view than maybe people were in the 1960s. But I also don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just some dumb Millennial take.\n\nHarris: It\u2019s like if somebody goes up, and they\u2019re like: \u201cThis isn\u2019t what Interstellar looked like.\u201d\n\nKoren: (Laughs.) \u201cWhere\u2019s the wormhole?\u201d\n\nHarris: \u201cI was expecting a wormhole.\u201d And all they see is, as Shatner said, this great blackness of space.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The Tennessee Titans are poised to make a significant change in their Week 17 matchup against the Jacksonville Jaguars, as they prepare to face off with a playoff spot on the line. According to reports, the Titans have opted to switch quarterbacks, with Joshua Dobbs taking the reins from the struggling Malik Willis.\n\nThe Titans, who clinched the AFC South title with a 10-5 record, have been riding the arm of Willis in recent weeks, going 5-3 in their last eight games. However, the team felt they needed a change of pace as they head into this pivotal Week 17 game. Dobbs, a fourth-round pick in the 2017 NFL Draft, brings a wealth of experience to the table, having served as the primary backup behind Ben Roethlisberger with the Pittsburgh Steelers for the past three seasons.\n\nDobbs, in his fourth year in the NFL, has only thrown 12 regular-season passes, making this a significant risk for the Titans. Nevertheless, the team believes Dobbs has the potential to lead them to a deep playoff run this season. With an outstanding defense and strong running game, Dobbs doesn't need to do too much to secure a win. However, he must be efficient with the ball, as the Titans cannot afford to turn it over and give the Jaguars' offense an easy opportunity to score.\n\nThe Titans' decision to start Dobbs adds an intriguing layer to their Week 17 matchup. The Jaguars, meanwhile, are still deciding between Gardner Minshew and Jake Luton at quarterback. Whoever gets the nod will have a chance to lead the Jaguars to a massive upset and steal the AFC South crown from the Titans. With Dobbs at the helm, it will be fascinating to see how he handles the pressure of this high-stakes game. Regardless of the outcome, Dobbs will be an interesting player to watch in the future, as he'll have the opportunity to showcase his skills in this crucial matchup. The Titans are pinning their hopes on Dobbs leading them to a win and a playoff spot, but only time will tell if his new role will yield the desired results.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Christian Lawrence, 29, is one of Business Insider's Rising Stars of Real Estate for 2022.\n\nIn 2 years, he's built Rise Modular into a company with 150 employees and over 400 units under construction.\n\nModular construction can make housing more affordable by delivering units at a lower cost, he says.\n\nTop editors give you the stories you want \u2014 delivered right to your inbox each weekday.

At Rise, which specializes in multi-story and commercial real estate construction, this can mean building an entire floor of a home or apartment \u2014 including kitchens, bathrooms, and appliances \u2014 at its 150,000-square-foot warehouse and then transporting it to a job site for installation.\n\nBuilding homes off-site can help speed up the time it takes to complete homes in areas of the country that face extreme weather, Lawrence said, as the initial construction process takes place inside and away from the elements. It's also more efficient in the sense that workers build the homes in an assembly line approach versus starting from scratch at each job site. Economies of scale not only reduce material costs, but they can also reduce waste generated during construction, Lawrence added.\n\nIn just two and a half years, Lawrence has grown Rise Modular into a business that has completed more than 760 housing units as of November 2022. Rise has also grown to 150 employees and has another 400 units currently under construction.\n\n\"We need to find a better way to build housing for everyone,\" Lawrence told Insider in November. \"Everyone acknowledges the challenges we have as it concerns high construction costs, and I think modular construction is one of the most innovative and sustainable solutions we have.\"\n\nRise Modular primarily focuses on developments like student housing, hotels, and apartment buildings, Lawrence said. The company has also been called upon by other developers to help finish projects that wouldn't otherwise be possible in a more traditional construction setting, Lawrence added.\n\nFor example, Rise helped complete a seven-story, 192-unit apartment building called Alvera Apartments in St. Paul in December 2021, according to the company's website. Lawrence said other developers on the project approached Rise to help with the project because they couldn't make the numbers work with a conventional construction company. Rise was able to complete the building with 154 different modular pieces which saved at least five months of construction work, Lawrence added.\n\nThe impact of modular construction can also be seen outside of construction sites, Lawrence said, because it can make housing more affordable for renters at a time when wages are stagnant due to inflation. For instance, rents for studio and one-bedroom apartments at Alvera start at around $940 and $1,375 per month, respectively, according to the building's website.\n\nThe studio unit shaves off nearly $300 per month compared to the median rent for a studio apartment in Minneapolis while the one-bedroom apartment is about $200 less than the median, according to data from ApartmentList.com.\n\n\"Modular construction has the potential to provide housing at a lower cost and deliver buildings in a more cost-effective way than traditional sticks-and-bricks construction,\" Lawrence said. \"It can also deliver a higher quality and more environmentally sustainable product.\"\n\nThese apartments are also hitting the market at a time when real wages in Minneapolis are decreasing because of inflation. According to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, wages in construction and professional services have increased by 5% as of November 2022. However, consumer price data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that inflation reached 5.3% in November, meaning that workers saw the spending power of their wages decrease by 0.3% over the last year.\n\nIn the next three to five years, Lawrence said he expects Rise to become a leader in the modular construction space. The process has been used successfully for decades in Europe, but Lawrence said there are very few companies in the US who are up to the challenge, especially in the Midwest where cold winters and snow can grind construction to a halt.\n\n\"We've proved that there are real cost and time savings associated with modular construction,\" Lawrence said", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Insider asked creator economy industry professionals to share their predictions for 2023.\n\nTheir predictions include more Gen X and millennial creators, and startups closing their doors.\n\nSee which trends to watch for in 2023 below.\n\n2023 will be an adjustment year for the creator economy as it adapts to fears of a recession and to the potential consequences of an economic downturn.\n\nSome influencers began developing strategies to stay afloat well before 2023. Creators and managers told Insider in November that business could take a hit if cash-strapped advertisers become pickier about who they sponsor.\n\nPamela Zapata, the CEO of talent-management firm Society18, told Insider that she is preparing for 2023 by looking to diversify her firm's offerings beyond influencer management, and expanding into helping brands execute deals.\n\nBut even with an impending downturn, social-media usage is still expected to rise. Insider Intelligence expects nearly 70% of Gen Z to use TikTok monthly in 2023, up from 64% in 2022.\n\nWe spoke with investors, influencer marketers, and industry experts, who shared their best predictions for the creator economy in 2023.\n\nThey expect to see more Gen X and millennial creators, more influencers who identify as YouTubers, and a shakeup in the startup sphere.\n\n1. More creators \u2014 and more generations \u2014 will join the industry\n\nShannae Ingleton Smith, cofounder of talent-management firm Kensington Grey, predicted that TikTok would attract more Gen X and millennial creators as the platform continues to grow and expand in 2023.\n\n\"Gen Z will definitely continue to shine and continue to have their moment, but we are going to start to see some really huge rising stars that were not ever successful or big on Instagram or YouTube previously that will start from scratch on TikTok and become super-star huge,\" Ingleton Smith said.\n\nShe's recently seen people like the actress Julia Fox talk about \"the glamorization of aging\" as a new TikTok trend, for example.\n\nYouTube; Rachel Mendelson/Insider\n\nYouTube, in particular, could see a new wave of creators.\n\n\"In 2023, I think we're going to see a record number of creators identify as YouTubers for the first time,\" said Lia Haberman, adjunct marketing professor at UCLA Extension. \"Shorts lowered the barrier to entry for creators who never saw themselves as part of that ecosystem and the addition of AdSense payouts for short-form videos makes the platform so much more appealing. For professional creators, YouTube is currently the best bet for a sustainable income through predictable content distribution.\"\n\nZack Honarvar, founder of talent-management firm One Day Entertainment, predicted that more creators would hire larger production and business-development teams. He also said he believes that there will be a nostalgic return to \"old\" YouTube formats like vlogging, and that content will become more global, such as dubbed videos in foreign markets.\n\nNon-US creators could also become more popular in 2023, said Josh Glodoveza, VP of talent at merch company Fanjoy.\n\n\"With technology being more available in the next few years in different countries, we're going to see a more global idea of a creator,\" he said.\n\n2. Creators will expand their content beyond photos and short-form video\n\nDarren Lachtman, cofounder of digital-production company Brat, predicted creators would continue to expand into podcasts as they look to grow their audiences across multiple platforms.\n\n\"We will continue to see the evolution from just pure audio into more 'vodcast' productions as creators blend audio and video,\" he wrote to Insider. \"This format allows creators to post the same content across various platforms.\"\n\nMore creators may also develop strategies for livestreaming in 2023, predicted Christen Nino De Guzman, founder of startup Clara.\n\n\"When I worked at TikTok, livestreaming was huge for the Chinese version of TikTok, and they tended to see many trends originate first in China and the US would follow shortly after,\" she said.\n\nWitthaya Prasongsin/Getty Images\n\nSimilarly, Haberman thinks that there will be more education around helping platforms, retailers, marketers, and creators find new ways to connect with audiences and get more potential customers into the funnel, especially when it comes to livestreaming.\n\nLivetreaming takes a different set of skills and talent than \"staging the perfect photo op or storyboarding a 20-second video clip,\" she said.\n\nBut creators who develop those skills may be able to hold audiences' attentions for longer.\n\n\"Creators who can be on live for hours at a time are going to start doing really well, because it's more than just scrolling through content,\" said Julian Andrew, founder of the influencer talent-management firm Talentiish. \"People want more long-form content, so just keeping someone's attention on live will become a trend in 2023.\"\n\n3. Live shopping could finally have its moment in the US\n\nIndustry insiders may have been premature in declaring 2022 the year of social and live shopping.\n\nWhile a number of social-media platforms launched new shopping features, some platforms like Meta and TikTok reevaluated their plays in this space. Live-shopping startups, such as Popshop Live, have also had to cut costs as the market soured in 2022.\n\n2023 could be different, though.\n\nViral Nation cofounder Joe Gagliese said he thinks that the market is bound to grow, citing how live shopping was a $300 billion market in China as of 2021 (according to Insider Intelligence data).\n\n\"Both people and brands have come to realize that streaming not only serves for entertainment, but creates profit as well,\" he said.\n\nAdoption in the US market may be an uphill battle, however.\n\nInsider Intelligence found that US customers have been slow to adopt live shopping and other social commerce methods. According to an October survey by Insider Intelligence, 43% of US adults said that they \"have neither engaged in livestream commerce nor are interested in doing so.\"\n\neMarketer/Insider Intelligence\n\nBut broader social commerce could have a moment as more and more people make purchases via platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.\n\n\"The creator-guided shopping experience will become the preferred way to shop for more people because it's efficient in saving time and money and more personalized,\" said Amber Venz Box, cofounder and president of the shopping app LTK.\n\n4. Some creator economy startups might close their doors\n\nIn 2022, layoffs were rampant in the creator economy, as companies like Patreon and Jellysmack reacted to the economic slowdown by letting employees go. Nick Chen, cofounder of creator-monetization startup Pico, said that the negative impacts on startups will not only continue in 2023, but could become worse.\n\n\"A lot of creator startups are going to die\" in 2023, he said. \"Venture capitalists think this isn't the time to be betting on the creator economy, so the next nine months will be really tough.\"\n\nSince many startups came into the space at the height of the pandemic, Chen thinks that some will run out of money in the next three to six months, especially because venture-capital funding has been more difficult to come by this year compared to 2020 and 2021. As a result, some startups running low on cash could decide to close their doors permanently.\n\nQianna Smith Bruneteau, founder of the American Influencer Council, said she believes that some creator startups will have a tough time surviving.\n\n\"Many of them will fail because they raised at insane valuations that they can't keep up with, and a lot of them struggle to acquire a user base,\" she said.\n\nRachel Mendelson/Insider\n\nSeveral experts pointed to the link-in-bio space as one category where doors could shutter. Cynthia Ruff, creator and founder of Hashtag Pay Me, said that she wouldn't be surprised if the space \"lost 10 link-in-bio companies\" in 2023.\n\nHowever, Chen predicts that the economy might pick back up in Q4 2023, at which time startups that are still around could replenish their purses.\n\n\"I think we'll recover by Labor Day, if startups can wait until then to fundraise,\" Chen said.\n\n5. Meanwhile, there could be an M&A frenzy on the horizon\n\nAs a result of the tougher macroeconomic environment, a looming recession, and a funding chill, the startup space could experience a wave of dealmaking and consolidation.\n\n\"Depressed valuations and multiples mean that most acquisition targets are effectively 'on sale,'\" said Alex Zirin, an associate at consulting firm RockWater Industries. \"As a result, institutional acquirers, like private-equity firms who still have dry powder to spend, will start snatching up mid-to-large sized creator startups at much more advantageous prices.\"\n\nHeading into 2023, industry experts are eyeing saturated niches within the creator economy, such as link-in-bio companies or fintech solutions for creators.\n\n\"From the creator's end, there's just so many choices,\" said Avi Gandhi, founder of the advisory firm Partner with Creators. \"The odds that they're going to pick your service \u2014 or any given service \u2014 are suddenly exponentially lower, and sometimes they're not even picking a service because it's overwhelming.\"\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misstated the title of Josh Glodoveza.

{"text": "A prominent health advisor in Australia has cautioned the government against imposing additional travel restrictions on individuals arriving from China, amidst a growing COVID-19 outbreak in the country's largest city.\n\nThe warning comes as Australia reports its highest number of new COVID-19 cases in four weeks, sparking concerns about a potential second wave of the virus.\n\nIn a statement, the chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, emphasized that imposing travel restrictions might have unintended consequences. \"If we restrict travel, people will find alternative routes, and we won't be able to control the situation,\" Kelly said. \"Instead, we should focus on strengthening our quarantine processes and supporting those who have returned from high-risk areas.\"\n\nThe warning coincides with a growing COVID-19 outbreak in Melbourne, which has recorded the highest daily tally since the pandemic began. The Victoria state government has implemented stricter movement restrictions, including a curfew and bans on visiting family and friends.\n\nThe national government has thus far resisted calls to impose a similar lockdown on the rest of Australia. Meanwhile, the state government has placed travel restrictions on international arrivals, requiring a two-week hotel quarantine for those coming from abroad.\n\nThe Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, the country's top health panel, does not support extending the hotel quarantine program to all international destinations. The committee notes that while the risk of imported cases remains low, the program is \"disproportionately burdensome and costly\" and may not have a lasting impact on community transmission.\n\nDespite these warnings, the federal government has not ruled out further travel restrictions for travelers from China and other countries with high COVID-19 transmission rates. The Australian Prime Minister has expressed support for reducing the number of international arrivals.\n\nHealth experts, however, caution against relying too heavily on travel restrictions and instead recommend focusing on measures such as increased testing, contact tracing, and proper quarantine. \"It's crucial that we focus on reducing COVID-19 transmission in Australia through public health measures, rather than solely relying on travel restrictions,\" said Professor Mary-Louise McLaws, an infectious disease expert.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "When it comes to safeguarding our little ones from microbes, most caregivers are aware of the importance of maintaining good hand hygiene and sanitizing frequently touched surfaces. However, what many may not be aware of is that seemingly harmless playthings can also serve as breeding grounds for germs. A recent study published in the Journal of Pediatrics has discovered that nearly a third of household toys harbor enough bacteria and viruses to pose a risk of infectious disease to children, even exceeding the germs found on public toilet seats.\n\nSo, which toys are the most contaminated, and what can be done about them?\n\nThe most contaminated playthings\n\nThe Pediatrics study found that rubber balls, which are often popular birthday gifts, tend to be the filthiest objects in the home. Other beloved toys, such as plush animals and action figures, can also be quite germy, with some samples containing more than 100 times the amount of germs found on a public toilet seat.\n\nThe study also revealed that toys that come into contact with the mouth, such as dolls, pacifiers, and teethers, can harbor large amounts of bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as viruses like the common cold and influenza.\n\nWhy are toys so germy?\n\nExperts believe that toys become contaminated due to children's tendency to handle them with less-than-perfect hygiene habits and play in areas that are not always clean. Additionally, rubber toys are particularly vulnerable to germs because they are porous, allowing bacteria and viruses to easily lodge themselves in the toy's crevices and be difficult to remove.\n\nHow to clean your kids' playthings\n\nTo keep children's toys clean, experts recommend regularly inspecting them and discarding any that are in poor condition. Some toys can be simply wiped down with a soapy damp cloth or disinfectant, while others may require submersion in soapy warm water or boiling.\n\nIt's also a good idea to rotate toys to prevent them from becoming contaminated and to keep all toys in one room to make monitoring easier. Finally, be sure to regularly wash your children's hands and emphasize the importance of not sharing toys with other kids.\n\nWhich toys should you discard?\n\nWhile regular cleaning can reduce the spread of germs, some toys are simply too dirty and should be discarded. Here are eight of the most contaminated toys that you should consider replacing:\n\n1. Plush animals: One of the most beloved childhood toys, plush animals have been found to harbor higher levels of bacteria and viruses than most other toys. If the animal is clearly dirty, torn, or has loose stuffing, it's best to simply replace it.\n\n2. Rubber balls: The Pediatrics study found that rubber balls were the dirtiest household toy. Replace rubber balls every couple of months to keep germs at bay.\n\n3. Pacifiers: Experts suggest that pacifiers should be replaced every few months and not reused.\n\n4. Action figures: Action figures often contain more germs than other toys and should be washed or replaced if they become overly soiled.\n\n5. Dolls: Dolls can harbor high levels of bacteria and viruses and should be cleaned regularly and replaced if they become too dirty.\n\n6. Teethers: Teethers, which are put in children's mouths, should be washed after each use and replaced every few months.\n\n7. Plastic toys: Plastic toys are especially vulnerable to germs, so it's important to regularly wipe them down with a damp cloth and disinfectant.\n\n8. Playmats and foam blocks: Playmats and foam blocks can also collect germs and should be regularly cleaned with a soapy damp cloth or disinfectant.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Pediatrics study revealed that many household toys are teeming with germs and viruses that can put children at risk of illness. Caregivers can take steps to reduce the risk of contamination by regularly inspecting and cleaning their kids' toys and discarding any that are too dirty. Above all, caregivers should emphasize good hygiene habits to their children to ensure they're not putting themselves at risk of illness.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "In a significant decision, the highest court in South Carolina has invalidated a six-week abortion ban, upholding the state's constitution and rejecting legislative efforts to restrict access to reproductive healthcare.\n\nThe unanimous ruling is a victory for supporters of reproductive freedom, who argued that the law would have effectively outlawed abortion in the state, given that many women don't discover their pregnancies until after six weeks.\n\nThe court's decision has far-reaching implications, potentially setting a legal precedent that could make it challenging for other states to pass similar laws restricting access to reproductive healthcare.\n\n\"This is a major victory for individual autonomy and reproductive freedom, not just in South Carolina but across the country,\" said Dr. William C. Bell, CEO of a prominent reproductive healthcare organization. \"The court's ruling reaffirms the importance of respecting individual decision-making and the fundamental principle that women have the right to make their own choices about their bodies and health without interference from politicians.\"\n\nThe case centered on a 2015 law that prohibited abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, unless necessary to save the life of the mother. The court ruled that this law violated the state's commitment to protect a woman's right to reproductive privacy.\n\n\"This court is constitutionally bound to recognize and protect the right of privacy that is inherent in the liberty of all individuals,\" wrote Justice Kaye Hearn in her opinion. \"The right to reproductive privacy is deeply rooted in our state's tradition of respecting individual autonomy and self-determination, and in our state constitution's guarantee of individual liberty.\"\n\nThe ruling was welcomed by advocates for reproductive freedom, who have seen similar laws banning abortion after six weeks or the point of \"fetal viability\" pop up in other states. These laws have been blocked by the courts for now, but many fear that the conservative-leaning Supreme Court could eventually overturn the landmark decision that legalized abortion nationwide.\n\nThe South Carolina ruling could provide additional legal ammunition for advocates to challenge similar laws in other states.\n\n\"This ruling affirms that women must have the freedom to make their own decisions about their bodies and pregnancies, free from political interference,\" said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of a reproductive rights organization. \"It is a powerful reminder that courts remain a critical bulwark against laws intended to limit access to reproductive healthcare and push abortion out of reach.\"\n\nThe ruling also highlights the importance of judicial appointments, as the South Carolina Supreme Court was only able to issue the ruling due to the recent appointment of two new justices.\n\nThe court now has a majority of justices appointed by Democratic governors, ensuring that the state's highest court will remain supportive of reproductive rights for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe ruling is a significant victory for women's rights in South Carolina, where the legislature has been pushing for more restrictive abortion policies. However, the ruling is likely to have national implications, providing a legal precedent for other states to follow and a reminder to politicians that a woman's right to choose is still protected.", "label": "machine"}

This contest pitted the Big 12 against the Big Ten, with TCU dominating the offensive sphere and Michigan presenting a robust defense.\n\nThe Horned Frogs commenced the game with a 20-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Casey Pachall to wide receiver Brandon Carter on their initial possession. This established the tone for the remainder of the game, as TCU continued to move the ball down the field with relative ease. The Wolverine defense displayed moments of brilliance, with standout performances from linebacker Desmond Morgan and safety Raymon Taylor, but ultimately failed to halt the TCU offense.\n\nAs the game progressed, Michigan's offense struggled to find its footing against the stalwart TCU defense. The Wolverines' struggles were evident in their meager 221 total offensive yards. Matters did not improve for the Michigan offense when quarterback Denard Robinson was sacked and knocked out of the game after a forceful hit early in the fourth quarter.\n\nWhile the Wolverines were unable to gain traction on the offensive side of the ball, the TCU offense did not decelerate. The Horned Frogs would go on to score two additional touchdowns in the fourth quarter, rendering the game unwinnable for Michigan. The final touchdown came courtesy of a 19-yard pass from quarterback Trevone Boykin to wide receiver LaDarius Brown, propelling TCU to a 51-45 victory.\n\nBoykin, who replaced Pachall in the fourth quarter, finished the game with a 15-for-20 completion rate, three touchdowns, and no interceptions. TCU's top receiver was wideout Josh Doctson, who caught six passes for 94 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nFor Michigan, the bright spot was Robinson, who compiled a solid performance despite the punishment he endured. The senior quarterback finished the game with a 24-for-37 completion rate, 313 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions. The Wolverines' leading rusher was senior running back Fitzgerald Toussaint, who accumulated 76 yards and one touchdown on 19 carries.\n\nIn summary, TCU's defense was able to repel Michigan's relentless offensive assault, while their offense outpaced and outscored the Wolverines. This was a significant victory for TCU, positioning them well to compete for the Big 12 crown. As for Michigan, they will need to seek answers this offseason and look to rebound in 2014.", "label": "machine"}

That was down from 7.1% in November and below the average forecast for 7.2% in a Reuters poll of economists' expectations.\n\nEnergy prices increased 15.1% compared with 18.4% in November as wholesale gas prices fell across Europe in recent weeks amid record high temperatures.\n\nFinance Minister Bruno Le Maire told France Inter radio that inflation would see a downward trend over the course of 2023.

With revenues declining and demands for goods and services decreasing, companies must adjust their costs to remain viable.\n\nThe surging unemployment rate has left affected employees facing an uncertain future. Some are struggling to manage their finances, while others may be compelled to alter their career paths.\n\nUber, which initiated its layoffs this week, is one of the largest companies to announce a workforce reduction since the coronavirus pandemic began. The rideshare company cited the need to \"realign its organization to better serve riders and drivers\" as the reason behind the cuts, which will affect approximately 3,000 employees.\n\nIBM has announced plans to eliminate up to 10,000 jobs worldwide, with the majority of losses impacting the United States and India, two of the firm's largest markets. Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, is also shedding up to 5,000 jobs due to the pandemic.\n\nApple, a technology giant, is cutting 11,000 jobs from its retail stores in 30 countries due to reduced consumer spending. Meanwhile, McDonald's has announced plans to eliminate 3,500 positions across its corporate offices, although it did not specify exactly how many of those are corporate layoffs.\n\nThe layoffs come amid a broader economy-wide transformation. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 10.7 million jobs have been lost since the coronavirus pandemic began in March 2020, with the hardest-hit sectors including hospitality, retail, and leisure.\n\nAlthough some sectors are rehiring, others are continuing to struggle. Businesses are scaling back their operations and significantly reducing their workforce as they attempt to cope with the sudden downturn.\n\nThe job losses are likely to have long-lasting repercussions. In addition to the direct impacts, economists say the layoffs could result in a cascading effect, creating a ripple of economic pain throughout the economy.\n\nThe layoffs also come as consumer confidence continues to decline. The Conference Board, an industry research group, reported that consumer confidence dropped to its lowest level in four years in December, hitting a nine-year low for the month.\n\nThe downward spiral of job cuts and consumer spending has left analysts concerned about a sustained economic slowdown in the near future.\n\nIn addition to the white-collar layoffs, companies are beginning to implement their own austerity measures, such as wage freezes and reduced work hours, in order to save costs.\n\nDespite some signs of economic recovery, the wave of white-collar layoffs paints a worrying picture for the future. With the economic outlook still uncertain, the pressure on businesses to survive is only increasing.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "MANILA/BEIJING, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr will fly to Beijing on Tuesday for a three-day visit, during which he is expected to discuss, among other things, Beijing's activities in the disputed South China Sea that Manila describes as illegal.\n\nSpeaking ahead of his flight, Marcos said he looked forward to meeting President Xi Jinping and that \"the issues between our two countries are problems that do not belong between two friends such as the Philippines and China\".\n\nThis will be the second face-to-face meeting between Marcos and Xi after their November meeting in Thailand, and comes as the Philippines has raised concerns over reported Chinese construction activities and the \"swarming\" of Beijing's vessels in disputed waters of the South China Sea.\n\nLast week, a Philippine foreign ministry official said talks with Xi would include China's actions in the South China Sea.\n\nChina's foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin on Friday did not mention the South China Sea but said the visit \"will focus on an in-depth exchange of views on bilateral relations and regional and international issues of common concern\".\n\nIt will promote cooperation in agriculture, infrastructure, energy and culture to create a \"golden era\", Wang said.\n\nAnalysts expect Marcos to use the trip to help rebalance his country's foreign policy, which under previous leader Rodrigo Duterte moved closer to China and away from the United States.\n\nWhile the Philippines is a defence ally of the United States, under Duterte it set aside a territorial spat over the South China Sea in exchange for Chinese investment.\n\nBeijing claims much of the South China Sea, where about $3 trillion in ship-borne trade passes annually, with the area becoming a flashpoint for Chinese and U.S. tensions around naval operations.\n\nIn an address last May, Marcos vowed he would not lose an inch of Philippine territory to any foreign power, drawing cheers from advocates of a 2016 arbitral ruling invalidating China's expansive claims in the South China Sea.\n\nSince Marcos, the son of the late strongman who fled into exile in Hawaii during a 1986 \"people power\" uprising, came into office, he has twice met with U.S. President Joe Biden abroad.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Vice President Kamala Harris also visited the Southeast Asian country last year and assured Manila that Washington would defend the Philippines if it were attacked in the South China Sea.\n\nMarcos is clearly \"inching away from the extreme pivot to China\", Renato Cruz De Castro, an international affairs analyst at De La Salle University in Manila, said.\n\nBut while De Castro expects the South China Sea issue to be brought up, he does not expect Beijing to alter its position.\n\n\"At the end of the day, China's goal is to force us to accept the fait accompli, that they will be operating within our exclusive economic zone,\" De Castro said.\n\nReporting by Karen Lema and Neil Jerome Morales in Manila and Yew Lun Tian in Beijing; Editing by Ed Davies and Himani Sarkar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The escalating cost of fundamental necessities has precipitated widespread concern globally. While some attribute the surge to inflation, a growing number of experts contend that corporate avarice is also contributing to the issue.\n\nThe recent price hikes for essential goods have had a disproportionate impact on poorer nations, whose economies are heavily reliant on staple foods like rice and corn, which are susceptible to price fluctuations. In many of these countries, the price increases have led to protests and political unrest.\n\nHowever, the problem is not limited to developing countries. In the United States, prices of goods such as dairy, beef, and pork have reached unprecedented highs. Some are even pointing to corporate greed as one of the causes.\n\nAt the heart of the issue is the fact that many of the world's largest food companies have been accused of anti-competitive behavior and price manipulation. This has resulted in prices becoming too high for many of those who need them the most.\n\nFor instance, in the US, an antitrust lawsuit against the agriculture giant Monsanto resulted in their subsidiary, Bayer, being ordered to pay $265 million to settle claims that it was engaging in anti-competitive practices. This was followed by a federal judge ruling that Bayer had acted as a monopolist in the corn seed and soybean markets.\n\nSimilar cases have been seen in other countries. In Brazil, a series of investigations revealed that several major food companies were using unfair practices to drive up prices.\n\nIn India, a major scandal involving Nestle was uncovered by the Competition Commission of India (CCI), which revealed that the company had been manipulating prices for its products in the milk and dairy sector.\n\nIt is evident that corporate greed is playing a role in the rise of prices for basic necessities. This has led to a great deal of anger and frustration among many of those who are struggling to get by.\n\nAt the same time, there are some measures that can be taken to try and alleviate the problem. For example, some countries have imposed limits on the amount that companies can charge for food staples. This has been effective in some cases, but it can be challenging to enforce.\n\nIt is also crucial to ensure that antitrust laws are being strictly enforced, so that companies do not take advantage of their dominant market position.\n\nAdditionally, governments need to ensure that their economies are open to competition. Many countries have laws that protect certain industries from competition, allowing companies to keep prices artificially high.\n\nFinally, the public needs to be aware of the potential dangers of corporate greed and be prepared to speak out when they see companies engaging in unfair practices.\n\nIn conclusion, while inflation is undoubtedly playing a role in the rising prices of basic necessities, it is clear that corporate greed is also partially to blame. It is essential that governments take steps to protect consumers and ensure that antitrust laws are strictly enforced. If this is done, it may be possible to put an end to the economic hardship that so many people are currently facing.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "A fascinating phenomenon has emerged from the digital realm, showcasing the intriguing dichotomy between rhetoric and reality. During his presidency, former leader Donald Trump frequently criticized the \"mainstream media\" for allegedly disseminating false information or exhibiting bias in their reporting on his administration.\n\nContrastingly, Trump's political team and supporters, despite their vocal opposition to the mainstream media, subscribed to several prominent outlets, including the New York Times, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal. This revelation was made possible through the acquisition of nearly 30,000 emails from Trump's 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale.\n\nThe emails, spanning from November 2016 to February 2020, demonstrate that Parscale signed up for newspaper subscriptions on behalf of Trump supporters, covering a range of media outlets, including USA Today, Bloomberg, Politico, and others. The emails also suggest that Trump's team actively sought to influence the media narrative, with Parscale requesting favorable coverage and highlighting policy achievements.\n\nNotably, Trump's team was simultaneously engaged in attacking the mainstream media, as evident in Parscale's emails. He was involved in a campaign to discredit the media and spread false stories about their coverage of Trump's administration. The emails even revealed a plan to create a \"fake news\" website to undermine the credibility of the mainstream media.\n\nThese emails offer a unique glimpse into the tactics employed by Trump's team to utilize the media for their own purposes. Despite Trump's public criticism of the mainstream media, his political team recognized its importance and subscribed to several major outlets. This dichotomy highlights the complex dynamics between political rhetoric and real-world actions.", "label": "machine"}

Zo vertelt Harry uitgebreid over een ruzie met zijn broer prins William in 2019, die fysiek werd.\n\nPrins Harry: 'William viel me fysiek aan'\n\nDe passage begint met prins Harry die een confrontatie in zijn huis in Londen in 2019 beschrijft. Hij schrijft dat prins William tijdens een bezoek in hun toenmalige huis Nottingham Cottage op de grond van Kensington Palace, uithaalde naar vrouw Meghan Markle.\n\nPrins William zou Meghan 'moeilijk', 'onbeschoft' en 'opruiend' hebben genoemd, waarop prins Harry hem vervolgens beschuldigde van het 'napraten van de pers'. De confrontatie escaleerde, zo schrijft Harry, en ze begonnen tegen elkaar te schreeuwen. Er werden veel beledigingen volgens Harry geuit, waarna William beweerde dat hij alleen maar probeerde te helpen. Harry zei hierop: 'Ben je serieus? Mij helpen? Sorry, noem je dit zo? Mij \u200b\u200bhelpen?'\n\nBlijkbaar maakte die opmerking William woedend, waarop hij dreigend op hem af kwam. Hierop liep Harry, zo schrijft hij, naar de keuken, en William volgde. Over wat er toen gebeurde schrijft Harry in Spare:\n\n'Ik gaf mijn broer een glas water en zei: \"Willy, ik kan niet met je praten als je zo bent.\" Hij zette het water neer, noemde me een andere naam en kwam toen op me af. Het gebeurde allemaal zo snel. Zo ontzettend snel. Hij greep me bij mijn kraag, scheurde mijn ketting en sloeg me op de grond. Ik belandde op de kom van de hond, die onder mijn rug barstte en de stukjes sneden in me. Ik bleef daar even versuft liggen, stond toen op en zei hem dat hij weg moest gaan.'\n\n'Je hoeft dit niet aan Meg te vertellen'\n\nPrins Harry schrijft dat prins William hem vervolgens aanspoorde om terug te slaan, daarbij verwijzend naar gevechten die ze als kinderen hadden. Harry zegt dat hij weigerde dit te doen en William ging de deur uit. Blijkbaar had hij niet veel later spijt en bood zijn excuses aan. Toen William weer vertrok, zo schrijft Harry, 'draaide hij zich om en zei: \"Je hoeft Meg dit niet te vertellen.\"'\n\nHierop zei Harry: 'Bedoel je dat je me aanviel?'. 'Ik heb je niet aangevallen, Harold,' antwoordde William hierop.\n\nPrins Harry laat in Spare weten dat hij het Meghan Markle ook niet meteen vertelde, maar wel zijn therapeut belde. Toen Meghan later de schaafwonden en blauwe plekken op zijn rug opmerkte, vertelde hij het haar pas. Harry schrijft dat ze na het horen van het voorval 'niet zo verrast was en niet zo boos', maar wel 'vreselijk verdrietig.'\n\nSpare (Reserve) komt op 10 januari uit.

Following a meticulous examination, the local sheriff has concluded that Renner's incident was merely an unfortunate mishap.\n\nThe incident began on December 22, when the 49-year-old actor endeavored to clear the snow from his driveway using a snow-clearing vehicle. The task proved to be overly ambitious, as Renner became stuck in the snow and suffered a severe injury to his right arm.\n\nThe news of Renner's accident quickly disseminated, prompting fans to express their concern and support for his recovery. The story subsequently prompted an investigation by the Douglas County Sheriff's Office to determine the exact circumstances surrounding the incident.\n\nAfter speaking with Renner and other witnesses, the sheriff's office has concluded that the actor's injury was merely \"a tragic accident\" and that no malicious intent was involved.\n\n\"The incident involving Jeremy Renner was the result of an accident,\" stated the Douglas County Sheriff's office in an official announcement. \"We have determined that no criminal charges will be filed in this matter and we extend our sympathies to Mr. Renner for his injuries.\"\n\nThe statement went on to express sympathy for Renner and his family, as well as gratitude for the public's concern in the matter.\n\nRenner, who has not spoken publicly since the accident, is currently recovering at a local hospital and is expected to make a full recovery. Following his injury, he was forced to take a break from filming his next movie, Mission: Impossible 7, which is expected to be released in 2021.\n\nThis is not the first time Renner has faced physical injuries on the job. In 2018, he suffered a double arm fracture while filming a stunt for his Netflix movie 6 Underground.

{"text": "Mortgage rates are soaring, and it's a dreadful omen for prospective homeowners. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has breached the 4% mark, the highest level since the pandemic began, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA). This is a concerning development, as rates have been climbing for seven of the past eight weeks, and analysts predict it may be the start of a steady rise.\n\nThe impact on potential homebuyers is dire. Higher mortgage rates will make it increasingly difficult for would-be homeowners to afford a new home, and it will likely trigger higher prices for existing homes as buyers compete for a limited supply. The situation is particularly dire, as the number of people in the market for a home drops as rates rise.\n\nSeveral factors are driving the surge in mortgage rates, including the rising inflation rate and the improving economy. The economy's strengthening is putting upward pressure on interest rates, and the growing demand for real estate is also contributing to the uptick.\n\nWhile mortgage rates are still relatively low compared to historical averages, analysts warn that higher rates will likely lead to a decrease in homebuying activity and an increase in home prices. The consensus is that homebuyers should act quickly, as rates could stay low for a while, but they could also rise rapidly.\n\nHowever, potential homebuyers should exercise caution and ensure they can afford a home before committing to a mortgage.

With interest rates still relatively low, it may be the perfect time to make a move, but buyers should act quickly to take advantage of the current market while being mindful of the potential long-term costs.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The first major rail stoppage of the year has caused widespread disarray across the country as rail workers participate in a 48-hour stop-work action.\n\nMembers of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) initiated their stop-work action from midnight, with picket lines operational at all major London stations as well as at numerous other stations in major cities across Britain.\n\nThe industrial action stems from a long-standing dispute between the RMT and the train operator Arriva Trains Wales, who provide services in Wales and parts of the Midlands, over job security and the introduction of new roles.\n\nThe union has accused the company of attempting to \"erode the terms and conditions\" of its members, while Arriva claims it is proposing a \"fair and reasonable\" package.\n\nThe two sides have been in talks over the dispute since last October, but without any resolution.\n\nThe stop-work action is expected to affect approximately 110,000 rail passengers, with Arriva estimating the action will cost them up to \u00a3400,000 per day.\n\nCommuters in Wales and the Midlands have borne the brunt of the disruption, with very few trains running across the region.\n\nThe operator has been running a reduced service on its main lines, but it has been unable to provide any service at all on many of its local lines.\n\nThe RMT has stated that, despite the disruption, it is \"disappointed but not surprised\" that Arriva has not taken the union's offer of further talks.\n\nThe union is keen to secure job security and the introduction of a number of new roles that they say will ensure a better service for passengers, while Arriva insists they are offering the union a \"fair and reasonable\" deal.\n\nThe stop-work action is expected to conclude at midnight on Friday, though further disruption is likely as the two sides attempt to reach a resolution.\n\nBoth sides have expressed their willingness to engage in further talks, with the RMT saying it is \"ready and willing\" to work towards a deal that will avert future action.\n\nIn the meantime, commuters have been left frustrated and perplexed by the disruption, with many travelling long distances to get to their destinations.\n\nThe industrial action has also had a knock-on effect on other transport networks, with buses and taxis in the affected areas picking up some of the slack.\n\nBoth Arriva and the RMT are urging passengers to check with them before travelling and to plan ahead, while advising that there may be further disruption over the weekend.\n\nWith the two sides yet to reach an agreement, further stop-work action is a very real possibility, and both Arriva and the RMT are urging passengers to remain vigilant and plan ahead.", "label": "machine"}

Their words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMatt (Keene, New Hampshire)\n\nI've had some pretty insane things happen on my shifts \u2014 from an FBI raid during a showing of \"Joker,\" to having to fight off two people who were throwing haymakers at me in the middle of the aisle during a movie. We're in a college town, so things can get pretty crazy.\n\nI've worked at the theater in Keene, New Hampshire for five years. It's a family-owned movie theater, and I love working there. But what I wish customers would do is:\n\n1. Be polite\n\nI'm a nice guy and I love nice customers. I give polite people free popcorn. People who work at your theater are people too \u2014 it doesn't hurt to remember that.\n\n2. Don't throw your trash on the floor\n\nEspecially now, because a lot of places are so short-staffed and it's harder to get employees in to clean, throwing your trash on the floor is very uncool. It's also unnecessary.\n\nI've had customers who, if they're not finished with their popcorn, will just dump it on the floor. Sure, always having something to do means job security for us \u2014 but once in a while, it'd be nice if people were more considerate.\n\n3. Figure out what snacks you want before it's your turn to order\n\nSo many people just tell me they want a soda and popcorn \u2014 I can't do anything with that. So then I have to ask, what size soda do you want? What kind of soda do you want? What size popcorn do you want? Do you want butter on it? It's tedious.\n\n4. Put away your phone\n\nI can't believe I still have to tell people to put their phones away during the movie. We check our theater several times throughout the showings to make sure people aren't on their cell phones. We give multiple warnings, and yet I still have to escort people out for not listening. We give two strikes and after that, it's like, come on.\n\nTarik (New York, New York)\n\nI work at a theater on the upper west side of Manhattan. I've been working here for five years now.\n\n5. Read your ticket stub\n\nTarik said customers rarely bother to read their ticket stub \u2014 which leads to them asking redundant questions. Courtesy of Tarik\n\nTheater patrons purchase a ticket, whether it's online or at the box office, and then never look at the information on the stub. Pretty much everything you need to know in regards to the when, where, and how of your experience is on the stub.\n\n6. Know the name of the film you're coming to see\n\nWhen customers add words to the title or just completely botch it, it drives us insane. We're currently showing a film called \"All the Beauty and the Bloodshed,\" and I've had customers come up to the window asking for a ticket to \"brains and beauty,\" \"bloody beautiful,\" and everything in between.\n\nScott (Hayden, Idaho)\n\nI've worked at my theater in Idaho for just under five months now. Customers here are generally very kind and understanding \u2014 but some things I wish customers would do are:\n\n7. Don't ignore \"please wait\" signs\n\nScott works at a theater in Idaho, and said customers barge past \"please wait\" signs. Courtesy of Scott\n\nStrolling into uncleaned theaters is annoying and gets in the way of us cleaning properly after a showing.\n\n8. Don't just ask for \"diet\" as a beverage without elaborating\n\nThere are likely three different \"diet\" drinks here.\n\n9. Don't show up 30 minutes late to your movie\n\nI understand showing up late because you want to skip the ads, but I'll likely be doing other duties like restocking or cleaning, and we don't like to have to be dragged back to the front for stragglers.\n\nIf you work in Hollywood and would like to share your story, email Eboni Boykin-Patterson at eboykinpatterson@insider.com.", "label": "human"}

In response to the outbreak, the National Health Commission has recommended incorporating certain fruits and traditional medicines into one's daily routine.\n\nAccording to the commission, lemons, peaches, and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) can help boost immunity, prevent the spread of the virus, and aid in recovery. These recommendations are part of a broader effort to combat the pandemic, which includes measures such as mask-wearing, social distancing, and contact tracing.\n\nChina has also been promoting the use of TCM as a treatment for Covid-19 patients, with specialized clinics staffed by traditional Chinese medicine doctors offering a range of therapies, including acupuncture and massage. Additionally, the government is launching a nationwide campaign to raise awareness about the benefits of TCM and encourage its incorporation into daily life.\n\nExperts in China are optimistic about the potential of TCM to combat Covid-19, citing research that suggests certain traditional herbal medicines can block viral replication and reduce the severity of the disease.

{"text": "LAS VEGAS\u2014On this nippy January morning here, I tried the Dyson Zone air purifying headphones for the first time. My first impression: I was already chilly, so the purified airflow felt cold on my face. I almost wished there was a warm air option, but that seemed like an entirely separate engineering challenge\u2014maybe an idea for a future iteration, I suggested to Dyson's representatives overseeing my visit with the Zone.\n\nI'm weirdly obsessed with air purifiers, and use several of Dyson's tower models at home, so when I first heard about the Zone last March, I was excited\u2014probably unreasonably so. The Zone is exciting not just because it marks Dyson's first venture into both audio and wearable technology, but because it's different from anything else on the market. Air purifying necklaces exist (and don't work well, according to Dyson Senior Design Manager David Hil), but the Zone is the first air purifier I've seen designed specifically for the face. And, oh yeah, it's also a pair of noise-cancelling headphones.\n\n(Credit: Dyson/Angela Moscaritolo)\n\nI'm not the only one intrigued: The futuristic device, which aims to combat outdoor air and noise pollution, went viral for its Bane-like aesthetic(Opens in a new window). Some say they wouldn't be caught dead wearing the thing, but I couldn't wait to get my hands on a pair. So when Dyson invited me to try them out during this week at CES, I made the meeting my top priority.\n\nIt's a Lewk\n\nI spent about 30 minutes with the Zone, supervised by several Dyson reps the entire time (the same is true for every member of the media who has tried them so far). I'll reserve my full judgment until I have the opportunity to test the product at length in the privacy of my home. But based on my brief hands-on experience with the Zone, I'm impressed.\n\n(Credit: Damiano Crognali)\n\nThis might be a controversial opinion, but I think they look cool. Even if you dislike the design, you have to admit\u2014it's a lewk. Plus, maximalism is in (just look at the Apple Watch Ultra). When I caught my reflection in the mirror while wearing them for the first time, I let out a chuckle because, yes, they are outlandishly big. Early adopters will need some confidence to wear these in public, for sure.\n\nWhile wearing the Zone, the purified air gently blowing in front of my mouth and nose had no discernible odor, but the same was true for the ambient air. I suggested someone light a cigarette so I could test its odor-fighting performance, but no one obliged.\n\nInside each ear cup is a tiny compressor motor and a dual-layer air filter. The first layer, a negatively charged electrostatic filter, promises to capture 99% of inhalable particles down to 0.1 microns in size, particularly brake dust emitted from cars, as well as pollen and bacteria. The second layer, made of potassium-enriched carbon, absorbs dangerous city gases, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2). A duct on each earcup allows clean air to flow into the visor, which sits around the lower half of your face without touching it.\n\n(Credit: Damiano Crognali)\n\nDespite its size, the Zone felt pretty light and comfortable on my head. With the visor attached, the Zone weighs about 24 ounces. Removing the visor drops its weight to about 21 ounces.\n\nThe inside of the headband and the ear cushions are both lined with soft microfiber\u2014if you're familiar with the Lululemon yoga mat towel(Opens in a new window), it's a similar fabric. The headband and the face visor are both easily adjustable to fit a range of head sizes.\n\nThe removable face visor magnetically attaches to the headphones. It took me a few tries to figure out how to snap it on, but once I adjusted it for size, it was easy. When you pull the visor down towards your chin, the air purification and any music you have playing through the headphones automatically stop. You can turn the music back on when the visor is down if you wish, but the air purifier only works when the visor is up.\n\n(Credit: Dyson/Angela Moscaritolo)\n\nThe Zone has two buttons, one on the back of each ear cup. The left button lets you cycle through airflow speeds (Low, Medium, High, Auto, and Off), and the right button is a joystick that lets you control the audio (move it up/down to adjust the volume, left/right to skip tracks, press it to play/pause, or hold it down to activate your smartphone voice assistant (Siri or Google Assistant).\n\nIn Auto air purification mode, the Zone automatically adjusts its fan speed based on movement data captured by a built-in accelerometer. To test this feature, I got up from my seat and started jumping up and down, and the fan speed predictably ramped up on its own. As a side note, I don't necessarily recommend wearing the Zone while engaging in vigorous activity. It should be fine for a brisk walk, but it shifted and felt like it might fall off as I jumped up and down.\n\nTo correctly position the visor in front of your face (so it's covering both your nose and mouth), you may need to move the headband slightly back on your head. When I first started wearing the Zone, I had the headband too far forward on my head, and the visor only covered my mouth, leaving my nose exposed.\n\n(Credit: Angela Moscaritolo)\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to learn that the visor is completely washable with cool water and soap. When it gets dirty, you can take the visor apart (it comprises four pieces), and wash it with the included cleaning brush.\n\nThe Audio Experience\n\nWhile wearing the Zone with air purification enabled, you can hear the motor running. It sounds like a fan, and the volume gets louder as you increase the airflow speed. With music playing, you can only really hear the motor running with the airflow speed set to Medium or High. On the Low airflow speed, your music should drown out the sound of the fans.\n\n(Credit: Damiano Crognali)\n\nDouble-tapping the side of either ear cup switches between noise-cancellation modes (Isolation, which offers the highest level of ANC; Transparency, which amplifies outside sounds so you can be more aware of your surroundings; and Off). To test the ANC, I went out on the balcony, where a large air conditioning unit was running, and Transparency mode almost totally eliminated that background noise.\n\nI'm no audio expert, so I plan to team up with my colleague Tim Gideon, who is in for a full Zone review. That said, music playing through the Zone sounded sufficiently loud and clear to me. Via its companion MyDyson mobile app, you can choose from three equalizer modes: Enhanced, Neutral, and Bass Boost. I didn't hear much of a difference between Enhanced and Neutral, both of which offer a fairly neutral sound signature, but Bass Boost noticeably punched up the audio.\n\n(Credit: Damiano Crognali)\n\nIn terms of availability, the Zone is slated to hit the market in China this month before launching in the US, UK, Hong Kong, and Singapore in March. In the US, it will be available in two colorways: Ultra Blue/Prussian Blue, and a premium Prussian Blue/Bright Copper version. Pricing starts at $949.

{"text": "Illinois state government is moving forward with a new set of regulations on certain types of firearms following a series of tragic events in 2021.\n\nOn Monday, the state House of Representatives approved a bill that would restrict the ownership, sale, and transfer of specific firearms and accessories. The vote was 57-49, with two representatives voting present, and the bill now heads to the Senate for consideration.\n\nThe bill, sponsored by state Rep. Dan Bradley (D-Elgin), would prohibit the possession and sale of certain firearms that have a detachable magazine and a feature that enables rapid fire. It would also ban the sale and transfer of large capacity magazines and certain other firearms. The bill includes exceptions for military personnel, law enforcement officers, and members of competition shooting clubs.\n\nSupporters of the bill argue that these regulations are necessary to reduce gun violence in Illinois and other states. They claim that these types of firearms have been used in many of the deadliest mass shootings in the nation's history and are a danger to communities.\n\nOpponents of the bill argue that it would infringe on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens, and that it would do little to prevent crime. They also argue that it would be difficult to enforce and would lead to arbitrary arrests of gun owners.\n\nThe bill is part of an effort to strengthen gun control laws in the wake of several high-profile mass shootings. In 2021, a gunman killed six people at a bar in Aurora, Ill., and 22 people were killed in a mass shooting in Boulder, Colo. Illinois lawmakers are now looking to other states, such as Colorado and California, which have implemented similar regulations.\n\nThe House vote comes as President Biden has urged Congress to pass legislation to expand background checks and implement a national ban on certain types of firearms. If the bill is passed and signed into law, Illinois would become the third state to implement such a ban, following California and New Jersey.\n\nHowever, it remains to be seen whether the regulations will be effective. Critics argue that a ban on certain types of firearms won't do much to reduce gun violence, as criminals are unlikely to obey the law and many states do not have comprehensive background check systems. Still, supporters say the bill is an important step forward in the effort to reduce gun violence.\n\n\"We must stand together and act now to protect Illinois citizens from gun violence,\" said Rep. Bradley. \"It is time that we pass this bill and make our communities safer.\"", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "\u201cWe Need to Take Away Children\u201d\n\nWhat a superb piece of investigative journalism by Caitlin Dickerson. I hope the detailed history of this sordid story leads readers and voters to be more diligent about watching the way governments, both state and federal, deal with immigration.\n\nRon Kochman\n\nKenilworth, Ill.\n\nExplore the November 2022 Issue Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. View More\n\nCaitlin Dickerson\u2019s breathtaking investigation exposed the malice and incompetence of the Trump administration, as well as the failure of hundreds of government officials to stop a policy that deliberately traumatized thousands of children and parents. It reaffirms why Physicians for Human Rights concluded in 2020 that family separation meets the United Nations\u2019 criteria for torture and enforced disappearance.\n\nAs outlined in the UN\u2019s Convention Against Torture\u2014which the United States ratified in 1994\u2014four elements must be met to legally define acts as torture. Torture (1) causes severe physical or mental pain or suffering; (2) is done intentionally, (3) for the purpose of coercion, punishment, or intimidation; and (4) is conducted by a state official or with state consent or acquiescence. Both Dickerson\u2019s investigation and PHR\u2019s reports on the health consequences of family separation show that all four criteria for torture were met. The trauma from these separations did not disappear when families were finally reunited. As a perpetrator of state torture, the U.S. government is obligated to provide prompt and effective redress to survivors, including psychological rehabilitative services. Despite calling family separation \u201ccriminal\u201d on the campaign trail, Joe Biden has done little for its survivors. Instead, his administration\u2019s Department of Justice is fighting these families in court and defending the abhorrent family-separation policies of the Trump administration.\n\nThank you to The Atlantic for keeping this issue in the public spotlight. The officials who devised family separation or who stood by while this abuse was perpetrated may wish to turn the page and move on, but the thousands of families who were separated cannot do so until the U.S. government acknowledges the harm it inflicted and provides redress.\n\nRanit Mishori\n\nSenior Medical Adviser, Physicians for Human Rights\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nAs a state child-protection caseworker for 30 years and, more simply, as a human being, I was horrified when I first heard of Donald Trump\u2019s family-separation policy several years ago. Caitlin Dickerson\u2019s putting names and faces to that policy gave it a more poignant and personal horror.\n\nI grieve for the America that these leaders are carving out for my children and grandchildren. I feel anger and disgust at the moral bankruptcy and incompetence of the Trump world, and I was brought to outrage and despair by the report that border agents mocked immigrants. How can one possibly conceive of ripping a baby from a mother\u2019s breast while chanting \u201cHave a happy Mother\u2019s Day\u201d? Is this the face of America? May God help us all!\n\nFred Putnam\n\nHoulton, Maine\n\nI could read only a page or two at a time of Caitlin Dickerson\u2019s article. The pain of the families being ripped apart was palpable. Reunification will be merely the first step; healing the rupture of trust will take far longer. Studies of trauma indicate that this pain and its consequences may be passed on for generations. We, the people of the United States, allowed our government to do this. We should hang our heads in shame.\n\nWe can\u2019t heal the immigrants\u2019 trauma or mend the hearts of the perpetrators. What we must do is update and restructure our immigration system, now.\n\nJudith Matson\n\nVista, Calif.\n\nLet Brooklyn Be Loud\n\nThe sound of gentrification is silence, Xochitl Gonzalez wrote in the September issue.\n\nReading Xochitl Gonzalez\u2019s description of the \u201caesthetic\u201d of silence, I realized that it was one I grew up with, was trained to revere and need. I consider noise\u2014whether from a stereo, a car horn, an argument, a racing motorcycle, or a party\u2014an intrusion, a violation of my space and contentment. Why the need for so much quiet? What joy and life does this need snuff out in others and in myself?\n\nI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll succeed, but the next time I\u2019m bothered by another\u2019s shouting, I\u2019ll try to remind myself that life is a loud affair. It was always meant to be, from a baby\u2019s first cry.\n\nJean Cheney\n\nSalt Lake City, Utah\n\nI love quiet. I\u2019m currently in a protracted struggle with my local city council to have high-powered leaf blowers banned. They are an incredible nuisance, disrupting not only every sleeping child and working neighbor for a 10-block radius, but also every bird and bee.\n\nYet I fully agree with the author that we should let our neighbors speak, laugh, cry as loud as they wish\u2014and, yes, even party. I do not want to live in a world subsumed by machine noise, but I most definitely want to hear the sound of people living their lives fully.\n\nI believe that my local city council\u2019s exemption of leaf blowers from our local noise ordinance is racist, or at a minimum classist. Consider, for instance, a lively gathering of people of color being reported for a noise violation and the cops showing up. In contrast, my rich white neighbor can rest at ease knowing that their high-powered leaf blowers remain exempt. The implicit statement is that your party, your friends, your life are less important than your neighbor\u2019s manicured lawn.\n\nElliot Cohen\n\nBoulder, Colo.\n\nBehind the Cover\n\nIn this month\u2019s cover story (\u201c Good Luck, Mr. Rice \u201d), Jake Tapper writes about C. J. Rice, who was sentenced to decades in prison as a teenager and whose experiences reveal the empty promise of the constitutional right to counsel. For the cover, we commissioned the artist Fulton Leroy Washington, known as MR WASH, to paint a portrait of Rice . Washington recognized much of his own story in Rice\u2019s\u2014he spent 21 years in prison for nonviolent drug convictions before having his sentence commuted in 2016 by President Barack Obama. \u201cI realized that C.J. and I were similarly situated,\u201d Washington told me. \u201cHe\u2019s on a journey, on a path, that I have been blessed to make it all the way through.\u201d\n\nAs a child in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles, Washington cultivated an interest in art through jigsaw puzzles. \u201cWe\u2019d sit at the dining-room table, the family looking through the box and trying to find the piece that fits,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI would see the art coming together.\u201d But he truly started honing his craft during his trial, to pass the time. \u201cIn the courtroom, I would draw butterflies and characters, and even little people, in pencil.\u201d\n\nRead: An interview with Fulton Leroy Washington about the November issue cover art\n\nAfter his conviction in 1997\u2014a life sentence without parole\u2014Washington began experimenting with oil paints in prison.

He continued to create over the course of his incarceration, eventually painting the scene that he believes freed him, a prophetic work titled Emancipation Proclamation. In the painting, which depicts then-President Obama signing Washington\u2019s clemency papers, the artist reimagines Francis Bicknell Carpenter\u2019s First Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation by President Lincoln.

{"text": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nEven millionaires are noticing that grocery shopping has become really expensive. Just listen to Cardi B.\n\nThe rapper posted an expletive-laden video rant on Twitter asking \u201canybody that is responsible\u201d to lower grocery prices because they\u2019ve recently been \u201ctripling up.\u201d\n\nShe said she noticed the skyrocketing prices from a \u201csummary\u201d of money spent in her home every week, prompting her to ask \u201cwhat the f**k is going on?\u201d So, she said she had to see with her own eyes, and went to a grocery store to see the prices for herself.\n\n\u201cLettuce was like $2 a couple of months ago, and now it\u2019s like f**king $7,\u201d Cardi B said in the minute-long video. \u201cOf course I\u2019m going to say something: The f**k?!\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that sh*t is crazy,\u201d she added, sympathizing with \u201cmiddle-class people or people in the hood\u201d about the increase in grocery prices.\n\nCardi B used her platform, consisting of nearly 30 million followers on Twitter, to ask the higher-ups to \u201cput that sh*t the f**k down.\u201d She added that if those responsible for the high prices were to see her post, they might \u201cput it down.\u201d\n\nHer advice during these times? Budgeting, because if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re \u201cgoing to go broke soon.\u201d\n\nThe video is the latest impromptu economic observation from Cardi B, who has previously focused on the lack of housing inventory and the rising cost of living. A few days ago the rapper, worth at least $40 million, tweeted that \u201cgrocery shopping prices are ridiculous right now \u2026 You might as well eat outside!!\u201d\n\nUS food inflation has sparked a cost-of-living crisis. In the year through November, food got 10.6% more expensive, with grocery prices rising 12% and menu prices jumping 8.5%, not adjusted for seasonal swings, the Bureau of Labor Statistics recently said. In that same period, overall inflation rose 7.1%.\n\nDespite Cardi B\u2019s pleas, food prices are hard to control, since they\u2019re affected by a number of factors including extreme weather, diseases impacting crops and livestock, supply chain complications and geopolitical unrest such as the war in Ukraine. That can make it more difficult for the US government to use tactics like raising interest rates to moderate food prices.\n\nHowever, many big corporations have offset those costs by raising prices on consumers, as lawmakers including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren have frequently highlighted, saying the price hikes are \u201cdriven by corporate greed.\u201d\n\nWhen a Cardi B fan asked if the video will decrease prices, the rapper said: \u201cNot necessarily cause of me, but if we bring enough awareness to inflation you never know.\u201d", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The plight of John Baker, a 53-year-old individual from Long Island, New York, exemplifies the struggles faced by millions of Americans with student loan debt. Despite borrowing nearly $47,000 in 1994, Baker has been unable to make significant progress in paying off his debt due to a complex and bureaucratic process.\n\nBaker's story began with a private loan from Sallie Mae, which was later sold to Navient, a government-sponsored loan servicer. Initially, he was able to make timely payments, but financial difficulties led to him falling behind. He attempted to enroll in an income-driven repayment plan, but was denied due to minor technicalities.\n\nSince then, Baker has been stuck in a cycle of enrolling and unenrolling in various repayment plans, with his debt ballooning to $47,000. Despite numerous attempts to contact Navient for assistance, he has received little to no help, leaving him feeling trapped in a \"bureaucratic nightmare.\"\n\nBaker's situation is not unique, as millions of Americans face similar struggles in accessing debt cancellation promised to them. The process of applying for debt relief options can be complex and daunting, and the slow pace of federal programs only exacerbates the issue.\n\nBaker's story highlights the urgent need for better access to debt relief services and more effective policies to ensure that individuals with student loan debt can access the cancellation they need. For many, the debt crisis has reached a point of no return, and the longer it takes for debt relief policies to catch up, the more people will suffer.\n\nIn the end, Baker's dream of becoming debt-free is increasingly unlikely, leaving him feeling stuck and unable to start fresh. His story serves as a reminder of the importance of addressing the student loan debt crisis and providing relief to those who need it most.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Cases have surged in China since it dropped its zero-COVID policy in December, and the latest models now suggest that at least 1 million people may die as a result. Many countries have responded by policing their borders: Last week, the CDC announced that anyone entering the United States from China would be required to test negative within two days of departure; the U.K., Canada, and Australia quickly followed suit; and the European Union has urged its member states to do the same. (Taking a more extreme tack, Morocco has said it will ban travelers from China from entering altogether.) At a media briefing on Wednesday, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, \u201cIt is understandable that some countries are taking steps they believe will protect their own citizens.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, a Chinese official denounced some of the new restrictions as having \u201cno scientific basis.\u201d She wasn\u2019t wrong. If the goal is to \u201cslow the spread of COVID\u201d from overseas, as the CDC has stated, there is little evidence to suggest that the restrictions will be effective. More important, it wouldn\u2019t matter if they were: COVID is already spreading unchecked in the U.S. and many of the other countries that have new rules in place, so imported cases wouldn\u2019t make much of a difference. The risk is particularly low given the fact that 95 percent of China\u2019s locally acquired cases are being caused by two Omicron lineages\u2014BA.5.2 and BF.7\u2014that are old news elsewhere. \u201cThe most dangerous new variant at the moment is from New York\u2014XBB.1.5\u2014which the U.S. is now busy exporting to the rest of the world,\u201d Christina Pagel, a mathematician who studies health care at University College London, told me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but this is fucking ridiculous.\u201d\n\nBy now, it\u2019s well known that travel restrictions can\u2019t stop COVID from crossing borders. At best, they slow its entry. When Omicron was first detected, in South Africa in late November 2021, America blocked travel from southern-African countries in an attempt to prevent the variant from spreading; by mid-December, Omicron dominated the United States. Restrictions can delay the spread of a variant only if they are implemented while cases are low and before travelers have had a chance to spread it. Such policies were more effective early in the pandemic: A BMJ Global Health review concluded that the initial ban on all travel into or out of Wuhan, China, in January 2020 significantly reduced the number of cases exported to other countries and delayed outbreaks elsewhere by \u201cup to a few weeks.\u201d Later on, such restrictions lost value. The COVID Border Accountability Project, which tracks travel restrictions around the world, has found that border closures did not reduce COVID spread, at least through April 2021, Mary Shiraef, the project\u2019s principal investigator and a political scientist at Notre Dame University, told me. (According to the study, domestic lockdowns did slow transmission.)\n\nAt this stage of the pandemic, restrictions make sense only under two conditions, Pagel said: The country deploying them must have low levels of spread and good control policies, and the restrictions must be applied to all other nations, as opposed to just one. Neither of these conditions is being met right now by any country deploying travel measures against China. Even if a single-point ban did serve some useful purpose, the rules in place for China don\u2019t add up. Predeparture testing likely won\u2019t catch most infected travelers from China, Adam Kucharski, a professor of infectious-disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told me. A person could test negative one day and then positive a few days later. If the point of restrictions is to slow local transmission, Kucharski said, calculations based on his research suggest that travelers should be tested twice: once before they arrive, then about three or four days afterward. Doing so would catch infected travelers who initially tested negative while limiting their window for spreading disease.\n\nRead: Why America scrapped its travel bans\n\nThe best possible outcome of a travel restriction like the one the U.S. now has in place would be a very small delay before the arrival of a catastrophic new variant that has just emerged in China. In that scenario, any extra time might be used to intensify mitigation strategies and assess the degree to which current vaccines are expected to hold up. Historically, though, the time saved by travel bans has been wasted. After countries restricted travel from South Africa to keep Omicron at bay, governments responded by \u201cnot really doing much at all domestically,\u201d Kucharski said. In any case, as my colleague Katherine J. Wu has pointed out, the virus is able to spread easily in China right now without any further changes to its genome. Population immunity there is modest, owing to the country\u2019s low natural-infection rate and less effective vaccines, so the virus can infect people perfectly well as is.\n\nThe travel restrictions on China will have little impact on the spread of COVID, but they do send a forceful political message. The U.S. measures are meant to pressure China, by slowing its economic rebound, into being transparent about its COVID situation, Stephen Morrison, the director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, told me. China\u2019s alleged official death count, for example\u20145,259 as of January 4\u2014seems way too low to be believable, especially amid reports of overflowing Chinese hospitals and funeral homes. So long as the country isn\u2019t more forthcoming, Morrison said, then Chinese tourists, who have only recently been allowed to travel internationally, will continue to be unwelcome.\n\nExpressing this message through a largely pointless public-health measure comes with a price. When that measure fails to keep COVID spread at bay, faith in public-health institutions could decline, which Pagel said is the \u201cbiggest danger\u201d for the next pandemic. It also stokes the long-standing fear that Chinese people are more likely to carry disease than anyone else, whether foreign or American. \u201cWe are watching this policy so carefully to see if it will once again invite a racial backlash,\u201d Manjusha Kulkarni, a co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate, told me. If a rise in anti-Asian hate and violence comes along with more transparency from China about its COVID situation, the cost of these restrictions hardly seems worth their benefits.", "label": "human"}

This is revealed in their annual report, released earlier today.\n\nOver the past few years, Bitvavo has experienced tremendous growth. The founders, Daan Faber, Pim Fonteijn, and Arthur Whiteside, have strived to create a company that provides easier and safer access to cryptocurrency. The name Bitvavo is derived from \"bitcoins and freedom\" and represents a unique attempt to make the technology accessible worldwide.\n\nIn 2020, the company achieved several significant milestones. Revenue increased by 97% compared to 2019, resulting in \u20ac28 million in revenue. Additionally, the company obtained a self-sustaining European license and insured \u20ac20 million in cryptocurrency. Bitvavo even expects a doubling of customer growth with numerous new customers considering or already investing in crypto.\n\nAccording to their annual report, Bitvavo currently provides assurance for over \u20ac280 million of customer assets. This is made possible by the doubling of their insurance coverage in 2020. The company has also invested heavily in its security systems, allowing customers to store their cryptocurrencies with confidence that their assets are secure.\n\nSimultaneously, the company sees new opportunities on the market. Plans are underway to introduce the Bitcoin passport feature, enabling customers to prove that they have bought or sold cryptocurrencies. Bitvavo is also expected to offer several new cryptocurrencies to customers, providing them with even more flexibility in their investment choices.\n\nAlthough Bitvavo has experienced enormous growth in the past year, the company still faces several challenges. Cryptocurrencies still have limitations in certain countries, such as the US. Additionally, there is also significant regulation that restricts the sector. Bitvavo will continue to work towards reducing these limitations and clearing the way for more consumers to invest in cryptocurrencies.\n\nDespite the challenges, the company remains optimistic about the future. Bitvavo plans to further develop in 2021 by launching new products and services, such as the crypto-banking environment. With this investment in innovation, the founders hope to serve an increasingly larger share of the global crypto market.\n\nIn summary, Bitvavo continues to provide assurance for \u20ac280 million of customer assets, solidifying its position as a major player in the Dutch crypto market.

{"text": "Since the dawn of the 21st century, a novel paradigm has emerged in the realm of corporate governance, wherein entities with distinct investment strategies have begun to exert considerable influence over publicly traded companies. These entities, often referred to as private equity firms, hedge funds, and venture capital companies, acquire stakes in public companies with the aim of generating substantial returns.\n\nNotable among these entities is the Blackstone Group, a behemoth of a private equity firm boasting assets under management exceeding $567 billion. Blackstone's modus operandi involves acquiring stakes in companies, subsequently taking a passive role, and then pressuring the company to optimize its performance through cost-cutting, debt restructuring, and divestiture of underperforming divisions.\n\nOnce Blackstone is satisfied with the company's performance, it demands that the company distribute a substantial portion of its profits, often upwards of 90 percent, to its investors. This approach has drawn increasing scrutiny in recent years, as it prioritizes short-term gains for investors over long-term growth and sustainability.\n\nCritics argue that this investment strategy is myopic, imperiling long-term economic growth and job creation. They contend that these investments hinder economic growth in the United States, as companies are unable to invest in new projects or hire new employees.\n\nIn response to the backlash, some companies have begun to adopt a more shareholder-centric approach. These companies prioritize long-term returns for shareholders, reinvesting profits in research and development, and providing competitive salaries and benefits to employees.\n\nEntities like Apple and Microsoft have demonstrated that it is possible for companies to balance the interests of investors and stakeholders, achieving profitability while maintaining long-term sustainability. As the corporate landscape continues to evolve, it is essential for companies to be cognizant of the potential risks associated with excessive profit distribution to investors. Companies must strike a balance that rewards shareholders while providing value to employees, customers, and the economy.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Inflation burned consumers in 2022. Prices rose faster than wages, on average, eroding the typical shopper\u2019s purchasing power. Some things got so expensive buyers simply gave up.\n\nConsumers ought to get some revenge in 2023. Overall inflation has been slowing, from a peak of 9% in June to 7.1% in November. In coming months, there should be disinflation, or a declining rate of inflation, in many categories of goods and services. In some categories there will be deflation, or an outright drop in price levels. In the charts below, these trends show up as a declining rate of year-over-year inflation toward the end of 2022. By the end of 2023, many and perhaps all of those charts will show negative year-over-year inflation, or deflation. Here\u2019s where to watch for important price declines:\n\nReal estate. Forlorn buyers priced out of the housing market during the last two years may perk up in 2023. Home prices have already started to fall on a month-to-month basis, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller index and a variety of other indicators. The Case-Shiller index peaked in June and has since fallen four months in a row, with October prices the latest available. The reasons are well understood. Spiking mortgage rates, driven by the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest-rate hikes, have slashed housing affordability and driven buyers to the sidelines. Crumbling demand has started to bring prices down from the record highs of the COVID pandemic.\n\nSince real-estate repricing has just begun, it could go on for a while. It\u2019s very unlikely home prices will crash as they did after the 2003-2006 housing bubble, when average prices fell by 27% nationally \u2014 and by more in the frothiest regions. But prices have only fallen 3% so far, after a 26% spike from the start of the COVID pandemic to the peak in June. If home prices fell back to the pre-COVID trendline, that would be a drop of 10% or a bit more from current levels, which seems plausible.\n\nThe Fed is likely to slow and then halt its pace of interest rates hikes in 2023, which should allow home prices to stabilize at some lower level. At that point, it would take declining mortgage rates to boost affordability. Some forecasters think rates will be slightly below current levels by the end of the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.\n\nRent. Like real-estate prices, rents are likely to drop as rising interest rates cool demand for property. The Zillow observed-rent index has already dropped for two consecutive months, from September through November. This also seems likely to continue. Rents are still about 25% higher than pre-COVID levels, yet they\u2019ve only fallen by about half-a-percentage point from the 2022 peak. A return to pre-COVID trends implies a further decline of 10% or so. Many renters won\u2019t benefit until they sign a new lease, since rents are normally set for the length of the contract. But the worst of the pain may be over for people who haven\u2019t been able to buy during the last few years and then got stuck paying rent that\u2019s risen by double-digits.\n\n[Follow Rick Newman on Twitter, sign up for his newsletter or sound off.]\n\nCars. The inflation rate for new vehicles peaked at 13% in April 2022. For used cars, it peaked at an insane 41% last February. A semiconductor shortage drove soaring car prices, with manufacturers unable to finish building millions of new cars and frustrated buyers switching to used. The average price of a new vehicle soared to nearly $49,000 during the pandemic, according to Kelley Blue Book. Savvy buyers know how to haggle at the dealership, yet buyers have paid more than the sticker price every single month since January 2021.\n\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.\n\nThis won\u2019t last. The semi shortage is now easing. There\u2019s still pent-up demand for new cars, which means sales could stay strong during the first half of 2023, with prices moderating but not declining. By the second half of the year, however, there could be a glut of new cars, with prices falling back to more normal levels. Used-car prices will fall faster, and by more. Government inflation data show that used-vehicle prices are already 3% lower than a year ago, with bigger declines expected in coming months. Rising rates are denting used-car sales in particular, and repossessions could rise if there\u2019s a recession in 2023, as many economists expect. By the end of the year, used cars could be a fantastic bargain. Rental-car prices could drop this year as well, for similar reasons.\n\nAppliances. These require semiconductors, too, and at the beginning of 2022, shortages pushed the inflation rate for appliances to nearly 9% on a year-over-year basis. Appliance prices moderated toward the end of 2022 and could start to turn negative in 2023.\n\nElectronics. The price of computers, smartphones, and other gizmos normally declines over time, since ongoing gains in computing power consistently produce more bang for the buck. The chip shortage, combined with the work-from-home boom and a surge in demand for gear, pushed the cost of electronics slightly higher at the beginning of 2022. But that trend has now reversed, and drooping demand in 2023 could mean great deals on many tech products.\n\nHotel rooms. The cost of a hotel stay soared as the economy reopened in 2021 and 2022, and the lodging industry struggled to keep up with demand and rehire enough people. Those problems are now largely solved, with prices falling back in line. If there\u2019s a 2023 recession, watch for price cuts. Don\u2019t expect the same for airfares, however. Pilot shortages prevent airlines from putting more planes in the sky and jet fuel costs could stay high indefinitely.\n\nTwo wild cards. Food and energy costs may continue to strain family budgets and keep overall inflation above the Federal Reserve\u2019s target of 2% or so. Food inflation got worse, not better, during the last six months of 2022, and that could continue. Diesel fuel is unusually scarce, raising the cost of operating farm machinery and transporting food. High fertilizer costs are also pushing food prices up, and that\u2019s due in part to a disruption in fertilizer components from Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus, due to the Russian war in Ukraine.\n\nConsumers have gotten a break recently on some forms of energy, with gasoline prices down 35% from the peak in June and essentially unchanged from a year ago. But natural gas prices have been up for most of the year, pushing heating and electricity costs higher, since utilities that use gas normally lock in prices ahead of time. Global energy markets remain tight, which means a small increase in demand from anywhere could push prices up everywhere. That boost in demand could very well come from China, as it reopens following months of strict COVID lockdowns. Tightening sanctions on Russia could also affect energy supplies, especially if Russian President Vladimir Putin decides to cut exports of oil and gas. But there\u2019s always volatility somewhere, and price hikes in some things in 2023 will be offset by price cuts elsewhere.\n\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

{"text": "[1/2] Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy addresses Ukrainian people on the New Year eve, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Kyiv, Ukraine, in this handout picture released December 31, 2022. Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/Handout via REUTERS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 1 (Reuters) - The leaders of Ukraine and Russia both vowed to push for victory in New Year speeches, but while Volodymyr Zelenskiy spoke of gratitude and pain, Vladimir Putin urged duty to Russia, casting the war as a near-existential fight.\n\nZelenskiy, recalling some of the most dramatic moments and victories of the war, filled his emotional 17-minute video message with footage of Russia's attacks on the country and words of pride for Ukrainians withstanding attacks, darkness and cold.\n\n\"We were told: you have no other option but to surrender. We say: we have no other option than to win,\" said Zelenskiy, dressed in his trademark khaki outfit and standing in darkness with the Ukrainian flag fluttering behind.\n\n\"We fight as one team \u2013 the whole country, all our regions. I admire you all.\"\n\nA few minutes after Zelenskiy's speech - released just before midnight Kyiv time on New Year's Eve - numerous blasts were heard in the capital and around the country. The attacks followed a barrage of more than 20 cruise missiles fired across Ukraine on Saturday - and many bombardments earlier.\n\nAs the war drags into its 11th month, Moscow was unprepared for the staunch resistance and billions of dollars in Western weapons that have turned the tide in Ukraine's favour.\n\nRussian troops have been forced out of more than half the territory they took in the first weeks of what Putin calls a \"special military operation\" to \"denazify\" and demilitarise Ukraine. Kyiv and Western allies say Putin's invasion was a land grab.\n\n'FATE OF RUSSIA'\n\nPutin, breaking with tradition by delivering the New Year message flanked by troops rather than the Kremlin's walls, talked sternly and combatively about 2022 as the year that \"clearly separated courage and heroism from betrayal and cowardice.\"\n\nWhile trying to rally support among Russians amid embarrassing battlefield setbacks and growing internal criticism of his military strategy, Putin thanked Russian troops, but he also demanded more from them.\n\n\"The main thing is the fate of Russia,\" Putin, dressed in a dark suit and tie, said. \"Defence of the fatherland is our sacred duty to our ancestors and descendants. Moral, historical righteousness is on our side.\"\n\nRussia had planned a swift operation, but with the war dragging on it has been forced to put society on more of a war footing: calling up more than 300,000 reservists, retooling an economy hurt by Western sanctions and saying publicly that the conflict may be long.\n\nReiterating that the West is supposedly intent on \"destroying Russia\" by using Kyiv, Putin vowed he will never allow that. He signalled once again, that the war, albeit hard, will continue.\n\n\"We have always known, and today we are again convinced that the sovereign, independent, secure future of Russia depends only on us, on our strength and will,\" he said.\n\nANNEXED\n\nZelenskiy promised the return of lands Moscow proclaimed it had annexed in September.\n\n\"It's impossible to forget. And it's impossible to forgive. But it's possible to win,\" he said.\n\nWhile listing Ukraine's successes, Zelenskiy referred to the Crimean Bridge, Moscow's symbol of the annexation of the peninsula that linked it with Russia and that was torn by an explosion in October.\n\nWhile Putin immediately blamed Kyiv for orchestrating the powerful blast, Ukraine had not previously claimed responsibility for it - or any other attacks inside Russia, since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion.\n\n\"This year has struck our hearts. We've cried out all the tears. We've shouted all the prayers,\" Zelenskiy said.\n\n\"We fight and will continue to fight.

Update your settings here to see it.\n\nOn Dec. 4, Jackson left a game against the Denver Broncos early in the second quarter with a knee injury and was later ruled out.\n\nHarbaugh told reporters that the injury, later confirmed to be a PCL sprain, would leave Jackson out for \u201cdays to weeks,\u201d but wouldn\u2019t be season ending.\n\nTwo days later, fans got what seemed to be confirmation that Jackson could return soon, after ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter reported that Jackson\u2019s injury would sideline him for \u201c1-to-3 weeks.\u201d\n\nThen, the outlook appeared to change when The Baltimore Sun reported Jackson's recovery timeline to be \u201cwithin the four-to six-week recovery window as far as team trainers and physicians are concerned, according to a league source.\u201d\n\nNow, exactly a month after Jackson went down, Harbaugh seems annoyed about giving updates on the quarterback's status.\n\nThe Ravens clinched a playoff berth in Week 16 and it\u2019s possible Harbaugh is simply frustrated by the circumstances. Jackson was playing at an MVP-candidate level in October. Having a quarterback of that caliber unavailable for the most important part of the season definitely isn\u2019t ideal.\n\nThe Ravens are 2-2 in Jackson\u2019s absence. The team\u2019s Week 15 loss to the Cleveland Browns, especially, showcased the need for Jackson\u2019s return.\n\nHowever, Harbaugh and the Ravens\u2019 choice not to confirm that Jackson\u2019s recovery is taking longer than expected is strange. The confusion grows when Harbaugh\u2019s response is viewed from the lens of Jackson\u2019s contract situation, which took center stage in most discussions about the Ravens when he reportedly turned down an estimated $250 million offer from the team before the season.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Ravens can still use the franchise tag on Jackson this offseason, but there is likely to be tension over that if Jackson doesn't get a long-term extension.\n\nRegardless of this season not going the way Jackson may have hoped, the 25-year-old would likely still attract a ton of interest as a free agent or in a trade.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The year 2022 has witnessed an extraordinary surge in the stock market, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average achieving their best performance since the 2008 Great Recession. Despite significant economic events such as the US-China trade war and political unrest in Washington, stocks continued to rise throughout the year.\n\nThe major indices began the year with robust growth, which persisted even with occasional downturns. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both gained over 20 percent in the first six months, reaching record highs in June before experiencing a slight retreat in the second half of the year.\n\nThis remarkable stock market growth is largely attributed to the substantial stimulus provided by governments and central banks throughout the year. The US Congress passed several relief bills in 2020 and early 2021, injecting over $4 trillion into the economy. The Federal Reserve also implemented numerous interest rate cuts to make money more affordable for businesses and consumers.\n\nThe stimulus had an immediate impact, with industries such as technology, biotechnology, and banking experiencing significant gains. Investors bet on the economic recovery and the emergence of new industries, leading to impressive performances from these sectors. The technology sector, for instance, gained around 37 percent for the year.\n\nTech stocks were also boosted by the increased demand for products and services from new tech-driven businesses. The growing need for laptops, tablets, and phones, as well as streaming services and cloud computing, has become more pronounced as people continue to work, learn, and play from home.\n\nIn addition to tech stocks, the healthcare sector was another top performer in 2022. Companies in this sector continued to benefit from the pandemic, as medical products and services remained in high demand. Healthcare stocks gained close to 30 percent for the year.\n\nThe rising stock market also led to a surge in home prices. In the first half of the year, the average sale price of homes nationwide reached a record high. The booming housing market can be attributed to low interest rates, increased consumer confidence, and rising wages.\n\nOverall, the stock market's performance in 2022 was a positive sign that the economy is continuing to recover from the pandemic-driven recession of 2020. While there were some minor hiccups throughout the year, the markets were largely resilient, as evidenced by the strong gains in the major indices.\n\nAs investors look ahead to the rest of the year, most experts are cautiously optimistic. The continued economic recovery and the increasing demand for products and services from new tech-driven businesses point to continued growth in the stock market. However, investors should remember that all investments involve risk, and the markets are unpredictable. It is essential to conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "A recent incident in Mexico has sparked widespread concern and outrage. A natural spring-fed well, a vital source of water for the indigenous community of Cuajimoloyas, erupted in flames and thick smoke, drawing hundreds of protesters to the scene. The well, which has been in use for over a century, is believed to be the first reported case of a burning water source in Mexico.\n\nLocals awoke to the terrifying sight of the well engulfed in flames, with some attributing the incident to intentional sabotage by nearby oil and gas companies. Others suggest that the fire may have been caused by natural gas pockets. The incident has highlighted Mexico's ongoing water crisis, particularly in rural areas where access to clean and safe water is limited.\n\nAs news of the well spread, protests erupted throughout Mexico, with chants of \"the water belongs to the people!\" echoing through the streets. The government has promised to investigate the cause of the fire and take measures to prevent similar incidents in the future. However, environmental experts warn that water contamination remains a severe threat, especially as the oil and gas industry continues to expand.\n\nResidents of Cuajimoloyas are demanding more action from the government to ensure the safety of their water sources. The well, they say, is their lifeblood, and the government must do more to protect it. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the dangers posed by the oil and gas industry and its operations near water sources.", "label": "machine"}

However, major parcel and freight delivery companies, as well as airlines, are cautioning of potentially significant holdups this year.\n\nFedEx and United Parcel Service announced on Thursday that holiday package deliveries might be delayed due to an anticipated surge in shipping caused by the ongoing pandemic, combined with an impending winter storm expected to hit a significant portion of the United States over the next several days.\n\nThe storm, which is predicted to affect parts of the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast, is likely to bring heavy snow, ice, and strong winds, potentially disrupting air freight operations and ground package delivery as well.\n\n\"We're ensuring we're at the pinnacle of our service commitments to deliver our customers' packages on time and as promised,\" FedEx spokesperson James Anderson said. \"We have several contingency plans in place and have equipped our operational teams with additional resources to guarantee that the holidays for our customers are as joyous and vibrant as possible.\"\n\nMeanwhile, major airlines are warning of thousands of flight cancellations over the next several days. American Airlines canceled more than 1,000 flights on Thursday as the storm approached, while Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, and JetBlue each canceled more than 400 flights. Delta Air Lines expects to cancel roughly 550 flights on Friday, with additional cancellations possible.\n\n\"The number and size of the expected cancellations will depend on the weather and how the storm evolves,\" Delta spokesperson Alex Rabinowitz said. \"We anticipate the current winter storm will have an operational impact through the weekend, especially at certain hubs and markets.\"\n\nThe storm could potentially create further complications for shippers and freight forwarders. FedEx Express, the company's air division, could be affected, along with UPS. This could lead to reduced capacity for commercial aircraft that transport packages, resulting in increased time for customers to receive their items.\n\n\"We don't anticipate any major delays in the ground portion of our operations,\" UPS spokesperson Steve Gaut said. \"As for air transportation, the anticipated winter storm has the potential to impact air freight capacity.\"\n\nGaut said UPS is preparing for the storm and has plans in place to minimize service disruptions, but he said it's too early to tell exactly how much of an impact the storm will have on deliveries.\n\nMeanwhile, FedEx spokesperson Anderson said the company is monitoring the weather and is prepared to adjust its delivery processes as needed.\n\n\"We're committed to delivering the holiday season as smoothly as possible,\" Anderson said. \"We'll be prepared to adjust our processes so customers have their gifts, cards, and other packages as soon as possible.\"\n\nAs for the airlines, many are allowing customers to change their flight plans without penalty if the weather is severe enough. This could give travelers some breathing room if their flights are affected by the storm.\n\n\"Our mission is to ensure that customers arrive at their destinations safe and sound, and the airline is doing everything it can to make that a reality,\" Delta's Rabinowitz said.\n\nBut with the storm expected to last through the weekend, many travelers and holiday shoppers may have to prepare themselves for a possible delay.", "label": "machine"}

The party allows no direct criticism and imposes strict limits on free speech.\n\nThe company \"will continue to increase the investigation and cleanup of all kinds of illegal content, and create a harmonious and friendly community environment for the majority of users,\" Sina Weibo said in a statement dated Thursday.\n\nCriticism has largely focused on open-ended travel restrictions that saw people confined to their homes for weeks, sometimes without adequate food or medical care. Anger was also vented over the requirement that anyone who potentially tested positive or had been in contact with such a person be confined for observation in a field hospital, where overcrowding, poor food and hygiene were commonly cited.\n\nThe social and economic costs eventually prompted rare street protests in Beijing and other cities, possibly influencing the party's decision to swiftly ease the strictest measures.\n\nChina is now facing a surge in cases and hospitalizations in major cities and is bracing for a further spread into less developed areas with the start of the Lunar New Year travel rush, set to get underway in coming days. While international flights are still reduced, authorities say they expect domestic rail and air journeys will double over the same period last year, bringing overall numbers close to those of the 2019 holiday period before the pandemic hit.\n\nThe Transportation Ministry on Friday called on travelers to reduce trips and gatherings, particularly if they involve elderly people, pregnant women, small children and those with underlying conditions.\n\nPeople using public transport are also urged to wear masks and pay special attention to their health and personal hygiene, Vice Minister Xu Chengguang told reporters at a briefing.\n\nNonetheless, China is forging ahead with a plan to end mandatory quarantines for people arriving from abroad beginning on Sunday.\n\nBeijing also plans to drop a requirement for students at city schools to have a negative COVID-19 test to enter campus when classes resume Feb. 13 after the holiday break. While schools will be allowed to move classes online in the event of new outbreaks, they must return to in-person instruction as soon as possible, the city education bureau said in a statement Friday.\n\nHowever, the end to mass testing, a highly limited amount of basic data such as the number of deaths, infections and severe cases, and the potential emergence of new variants have prompted governments elsewhere to institute virus testing requirements for travelers from China.\n\nThe World Health Organization has also expressed concern about the lack of data from China, while the U.S. is requiring a negative test result for travelers from China within 48 hours of departure.\n\nChinese health authorities publish a daily count of new cases, severe cases and deaths, but those numbers include only officially confirmed cases and use a very narrow definition of COVID-related deaths.\n\nAuthorities say that since the government ended compulsory testing and permitted people with mild symptoms to test themselves and convalesce at home, it can no longer provide a full picture of the state of the latest outbreak.\n\nOn Sunday, the National Health Commission reported 10,681 new domestic cases, bringing the country's total number of confirmed cases to 482,057. Three new deaths were also reported over the previous 24 hours, bringing the total to 5,267.\n\nThe numbers are a fraction of those announced by the U.S., which has put its death toll at more than 1 million among some 101 million cases.\n\nBut they're also much smaller than the estimates being released by some local governments. Zhejiang, a province on the east coast, said Tuesday it was seeing about 1 million new cases a day.\n\nChina has said the testing requirements being imposed by foreign governments \u2014 most recently Germany and Sweden \u2014 aren't science-based and has threatened unspecified countermeasures. Its spokespeople have said the situation is under control, and reject accusations of a lack of preparation for reopening.\n\nIf a variant emerges in an outbreak, it is found through genetic sequencing of the virus.\n\nSince the pandemic started, China has shared 4,144 sequences with GISAID, a global platform for coronavirus data. That's only 0.04% of its reported number of cases \u2014 a rate more than 100 times less than the United States and nearly four times less than neighboring Mongolia.\n\nMeanwhile, Hong Kong also plans to reopen some of its border crossings with mainland China on Sunday and allow tens of thousands of people to cross every day without being quarantined.\n\nThe semi-autonomous southern Chinese city has been hard-hit by the virus and its land and sea border checkpoints with the mainland have been largely closed for almost three years. Despite the risk, the reopening is expected to provide a much-needed boost to Hong Kong's tourism and retail sectors.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Once considered the stuff of science fiction, Bank of America says self-driving cars now have \"real-world visibility.\" The \"feasibility\" of autonomous vehicles has risen significantly in the past decade, thanks to a \"multi-billion investment cycle\"; 5G networks; advancements in big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning; and a more conducive regulatory environment, Bank of America's Justin Post said in a note on Dec. 8. He added that full autonomous capabilities will take some time to be developed, but the groundwork is being laid with \"Level Four\" autonomy \u2014 largely seen as the final stage of development before a vehicle becomes fully autonomous. The bank said it expects 2.2 million autonomous vehicles to be on the roads by 2028, citing research by consultancy firm Berg Insights. In November, UBS estimated that China's autonomous driving-related market could reach $100 billion by 2030 . Internet companies Bank of America said this ramp-up in autonomous vehicles has \"broad implications\" for internet companies. \"Alphabet 's Waymo is expected to be a key supplier of AV technology and potential mobility competitor while Uber , Lyft and even DoorDash are likely to integrate AVs into their networks to reduce driver costs,\" Post said. \"Simultaneously, Amazon , Walmart , UPS , and others, are expected to modernize supply chain logistics with autonomous trucking,\" he added. Bank of America estimates that Amazon could enjoy up to $4.5 billion in cost savings if it used autonomous vehicles for delivery now, and more could be saved as volumes grow. The bank has a price target of $137 on Amazon, which represents a 53.9% potential upside to its closing price on Dec. 9. Ride-hailing firms Uber and Lyft could benefit from lower operating costs per mile, according to Bank of America's forecasts, although the cost savings are expected to be significantly lower than Amazon's. The bank added that getting the cost of autonomous vehicles down to the level of conventional autos will be key to their transition. Bank of America has a price target of $43 on Uber, giving the stock potential upside of 59.3%. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.", "label": "human"}

He emphasized the need for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to be able to match their scale and capability.\n\nThis is not a new development, as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has been pursuing an aggressive arms build-up since 2017.

He stated that Ally's higher proportion of short-term debt and less-liquid assets could make it a target for regulators.\n\nThe analyst also noted that Ally's loan growth has outpaced industry peers over the past year, a trend that could lead to higher credit costs. He added that Ally's higher loan growth could cause investors to reassess their risk tolerance as the industry normalizes.\n\nDespite these concerns, the analyst stated that Ally's \"positive\" operating environment and higher-than-peer loan growth should make it an attractive investment opportunity. He also noted that the bank's \"solid\" online deposit growth and low cost of funds could make it attractive to depositors, even with the potential for further regulatory scrutiny.\n\nOverall, the analyst advised investors to adopt a \"prudent\" approach with Ally, given the increased uncertainty surrounding the 2023 economic environment and the risk of regulatory scrutiny. He added that investors should look for signs of an improving operating environment before making a long-term commitment.\n\nIn response to the downgrade, Ally shares fell by 2.3 percent in morning trading on Monday. The stock had already lost 13 percent over the past three months.\n\nThe downgrade comes after a tumultuous period for the bank, which has faced challenges from the coronavirus pandemic. Ally was forced to lay off over 1,600 employees earlier this year, and its profits were down 24 percent in the third quarter due to higher provisions for loan losses.\n\nDespite the challenges, Ally has continued to post strong loan and deposit growth. The bank reported a 19 percent year-over-year increase in loans in the third quarter and a 24 percent increase in deposits.\n\nAlthough the company has been successful in weathering the pandemic, it is likely to remain under pressure as the economy recovers in 2023. With the new downgrade in mind, investors should approach the stock with caution.", "label": "machine"}

Skydance Media, the film studio behind \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" counts RedBird as an investor. CEO and founder Gerry Cardinale has been in the New York Yankees' corner for 20 years, helping the baseball team form its regional sports network, YES, sell a 49% stake at a valuation of more than $3 billion, and buy it back.\n\nBut behind the scenes, RedBird is quietly building a financial services arm, investing more than $1 billion in the past four years, according to a source familiar with the firm. A quarter of the $7.5 billion firm's business comes from asset management and insurance. Finance bets include MainStreet Advisors, Paul Wachter's investment and financial advisory firm known for boldface-name clients like NBA star LeBron James, as well as asset manager Aquarian.\n\nRedBird has raised close to $2.5 billion over the past 12 months, and is already deploying capital from its fourth fund to execute roll-up mergers in financial services, the source added. The fund is expected to close by midyear 2023.\n\nThe firm's philosophies for financial services and sports are one and the same: taking advantage of fragmented environments with firms that have long-term recurring cash flow. But RedBird doesn't have the same cache in financial services that it does in sports, so Cardinale is willing to acquire smaller firms and go to \"hand-to-hand combat.\"\n\n\"At our core, we are grinders,\" Cardinale told Insider. \"It's a lot of bottoms-up and top-down work. But that's the way our firm is set up. Don't be fooled by the sizzle of 'Top Gun' and the sports stuff. It's all the same thing.\"\n\nThis past summer RedBird poached Alex. Brown president Haig Ariyan, who presided over its sale to Raymond James from Deutsche Bank, to build out a new asset and wealth manager, Arax Investment Partners.\n\nThe firm has already had a major win with its buy-and-build strategy. It bought nine specialty insurance brokers over two years to build Constellation, which it sold to Truist for more than $900 million in 2021.\n\nRedBird has also made growth equity investments in fintech and insurance tech startups such as Covered Insurance Solutions, a digital marketplace for homeowners insurance, according to the source.\n\nThe rise of sports investing\n\nDiversifying away from sports and media is a good move for RedBird, said Don Gogel, the chairman of the private-equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice. Sports investing, in particular, is awash in private equity capital with firms spending $51 billion on sports transactions last year, according to PitchBook. Despite harbingers of an economic downturn, valuations are soaring, and many professional sports teams are up for sale, including soccer clubs Liverpool, Manchester United, and Paris Saint-Germain.\n\n\"There's a lot of capital that gets invested in sports. It's an attractive area that people think they know something about \u2014 whether they do or don't,\" said Gogel.\n\nCardinale, who started investing in sports at Goldman Sachs, is also cautious about this the influx of new investors.\n\n\"People need to calm down a little bit about sports,\" he said. \"This euphoria around sports scares me because it suggests a bubble environment and a caveat to beware.\"", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The buzz surrounding the cryptocurrency world is centered around the impending charges against Sam Bankman-Fried, a prominent figure in the industry, related to a trading platform called FTX. As the CEO of Alameda Research and founder of FTX, Bankman-Fried is expected to plead not guilty to the allegations in the coming weeks. The news has sparked concern about the future of the industry and Bankman-Fried's own prospects.\n\nThe charges stem from an ongoing investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice into alleged fraudulent activities involving Bankman-Fried and FTX. The platform, operational since 2019, offers derivatives and cryptocurrency exchange services. Bankman-Fried is accused of engaging in fraudulent activities, including price manipulation and wash trading, related to the platform's trading services.\n\nThe allegations against Bankman-Fried are severe, and if found guilty, he could face up to 10 years in prison and a possible fine of $250,000 or more. Given the high profile of the defendant, the Department of Justice is unlikely to show leniency. The charges against Bankman-Fried are part of a series of investigations into cryptocurrency-related fraud, and the Department of Justice is taking a firm stance against those who engage in such activities.\n\nThe news has sent shockwaves through the crypto community, which has rallied around Bankman-Fried since his rise to prominence. While many are skeptical of the allegations, some believe that the charges could be more serious than initially thought. The cryptocurrency industry is rapidly evolving, and it's possible that Bankman-Fried may have been in violation of certain regulations or laws related to the trading services he offered.\n\nThe case against Bankman-Fried is likely to move quickly, with the Department of Justice expected to file the charges in the coming weeks. Bankman-Fried is expected to plead not guilty, and his legal team is already preparing for a rigorous defense. If convicted, the sentence Bankman-Fried faces could be severe, and it could also have significant implications for the cryptocurrency industry as a whole.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, one thing is clear: the cryptocurrency industry is under increased scrutiny from regulators, and those who engage in fraudulent activities will be held accountable. This case serves as a warning to those in the crypto space who may be considering engaging in illegal activities, and it's likely to have a deterrent effect on future scams.\n\nOverall, the case of Sam Bankman-Fried will be closely watched by the crypto community and beyond. If convicted, it could send a powerful message to others in the industry and serve as a reminder of the consequences of engaging in illegal activities. The outcome could have far-reaching implications for the industry as a whole, potentially paving the way for greater regulation and enforcement.", "label": "machine"}

Kennedy International Airport so they could manipulate the line and charge drivers for access to the front of the queue, federal prosecutors said Tuesday.\n\nDaniel Abayev and Peter Leyman, both 48, were taken into custody on Tuesday morning in Queens and charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, prosecutors from the Southern District of New York announced.\n\nBeginning in 2019, the two allegedly worked with hackers based in Russia to infiltrate JFK's taxi dispatch system by bribing someone to install malware on computers connected to the system, stealing computer tablets and using Wi-Fi to break in, prosecutors alleged.\n\n\"I know that the Pentagon is being hacked\u2026 so can't we hack the taxi industry[?]\" Abayev allegedly texted one of the hackers in November 2019, according to the indictment against him.\n\nOnce the hackers successfully gained access to the dispatch system, Abayev and Leyman were able to move specific taxis to the front of the line and began charging drivers $10 to skip the queue, prosecutors alleged.\n\nTypically, taxi drivers looking to pick up travelers at JFK wait in a holding lot before they're dispatched to a specific terminal in the order in which they arrived. The process can take hours, and the wait time can have a significant impact on how much money a taxi driver is able to earn in a day.\n\nProsecutors estimate Abayev and Leyman were able to manipulate as many as 1,000 taxi trips a day throughout the course of the scheme, which went on from about November 2019 to November 2020.\n\n\"As alleged in the indictment, these two defendants \u2014 with the help of Russian hackers \u2014 took the Port Authority for a ride,\" Damian Williams, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District, said in a statement.\n\nDrivers learned about the scheme through word of mouth, and some were even allowed to cut the line for free \u2014 if they agreed to recruit other cabbies that were willing to pay, prosecutors alleged.\n\n\"For years, the defendants' hacking kept honest cab drivers from being able to pick up fares at JFK in the order in which they arrived,\" Williams said.\n\nThe suspects are slated to appear before Judge Gabriel Gorenstein later Tuesday. They face up to 10 years in prison if they're convicted. It is not clear if they had retained an attorney.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Samsung Electronics Co Ltd is set to release its fourth-quarter earnings guidance, with analysts predicting a decline in operating profits due to falling memory chip prices. The company is expected to report an operating profit of 8.1 trillion Korean won ($7.5 billion), down 5% from the same period last year. This would be the lowest quarterly profit since the fourth quarter of 2017. The decline in memory chip prices is a major factor, as it is a key source of Samsung's profit. However, analysts believe that the profit drop will be relatively small compared to the third quarter, and that the semiconductor division will experience a seasonal rebound. The outlook for Samsung's mobile division is expected to remain weak, while the semiconductor division faces challenges from Chinese manufacturers and US-China trade tensions. Investors will be looking for signs of a recovery in these divisions, as well as guidance on the display panel business. Despite the challenges, analysts remain confident in Samsung's long-term prospects and its ability to navigate the current business environment.", "label": "machine"}

The Russian frigate is expected to pass through the Danish straits and head into the North Atlantic, within striking range of the eastern seaboard of the United States.\n\nIn response, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has called on Russia to respect international law and avoid provocative moves, urging the country to refrain from further destabilizing actions and to continue engaging in constructive dialogue with NATO and other international partners.\n\nThe Pentagon has also condemned the move, describing it as a \"dangerous escalation\" and expressing deep concern over Russia's continued violation of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty.\n\nThe deployment has been met with a strong response from NATO member states and international experts, who warn that this could lead to a dangerous escalation of tensions between the two nuclear superpowers. Some observers suggest that the move is part of a calculated effort by the Russian government to signal its displeasure with the United States and its allies over recent policies.\n\nReports suggest that the frigate will be joined by two other Russian warships, although it is unclear if they are similarly equipped. The United States and its allies are closely monitoring the situation to ensure compliance with maritime safety protocols, with the U.S. Navy reportedly deploying warships to patrol the North Atlantic and requesting that NATO nations do the same.\n\nThe deployment of the Russian warship and its missiles marks a dangerous new phase in the standoff between the United States and Russia, highlighting the fact that the two nations are actively preparing for possible conflict. The United States and its allies must remain vigilant and united to deter any hostile intentions and protect the vital interests of the Western world.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "As the solar disk ascends, a tranquil tableau unfolds across the terrain. A small aggregation of black-bellied whistling-ducks has alighted upon a serene body of water proximal to the Texas municipality of La Joya. As a fortunate photographer captures this arresting instant, the global community is on the cusp of being introduced to an enigmatic enigma.\n\nThe photograph of the duck flock instantly mesmerizes the world, and soon it's disseminated virally. Ornithological enthusiasts from around the globe instantly recognize the species of duck, but it's the peculiarity of the location that truly piques their interest.\n\nBlack-bellied whistling-ducks are typically found in South and Central America. In the United States, they're usually observed as far south as Texas and New Mexico. It's an exceptionally rare sighting north of the Rio Grande River.\n\nAs questions accumulate, a team of researchers, backed by several nature conservancy organizations, travels to La Joya to investigate. What they discover astonishes them.\n\nThe body of water is teeming with other exotic avifauna, including a spoonbill and several species of ibis. There's also an abundance of fish and other wildlife.\n\nBut what's even more remarkable is the harmony that exists between the wildlife and habitat. It's an ecological paradise that defies explanation.\n\nThe researchers can't help but wonder how this unexpected pocket of nature came to be. It seems impossible that such a unique ecosystem could thrive in the midst of what is otherwise a desert region.\n\nAdding to the enigma is the fact that no one seems to know the origin of the black-bellied whistling-ducks. They've been residing in this little pocket of the Texas desert for years, and yet no one has a clue where they originated.\n\nThe only clues lie in a few local legends. According to one narrative, a long-forgotten missionary had been keeping a secret aggregation of exotic avifauna. This mysterious benefactor had concealed the birds deep in the desert, far from prying eyes.\n\nUnfortunately, that's the only clue the researchers have. The local villagers are unable to provide any further details.\n\nThe search for answers takes the researchers to other parts of the region, where they uncover a network of subterranean waterways and abandoned settlements. They also learn of an ancient civilization that had inhabited the area for thousands of years.\n\nThese incredible discoveries lead the researchers to a stunning conclusion: The black-bellied whistling-ducks aren't from South or Central America. Instead, they're descendants of an exotic species that was once native to this region.\n\nThe incredible tale of the La Joya duck flock has captivated the world. Scientists and bird enthusiasts from around the globe have converged to explore this unique ecosystem, and together they're working to preserve it for future generations.\n\nThis incredible photograph of the flock of black-bellied whistling-ducks has opened a door to a world of mystery, and it appears it may never be fully comprehended. But as the old adage goes, that's what makes existence so intriguing.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nRepublicans\u2019 take over of the House this week will usher in a two-year political era that threatens to bring governing showdowns and shutdowns as a GOP speaker and Democratic president try to wield power from opposite ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nThe unprecedented possibility that former President Donald Trump, who\u2019s already launched another bid for the White House, could face indictment could tear the nation further apart at a moment when American democracy remains under grave strain. The already stirring 2024 presidential campaign, meanwhile, will stir more political toxins as both parties sense the White House and control of Congress are up for grabs after the closely fought midterms.\n\nAbroad, the war in Ukraine brings the constant, alarming possibility of spillover into a NATO-Russia conflict and will test the willingness of American taxpayers to keep sending billions of dollars to sustain foreigners\u2019 dreams of freedom. As he leads the West in this crisis, President Joe Biden faces ever more overt challenges from rising superpower China and alarming advances in the nuclear programs of Iran and North Korea.\n\nIf 2022 was a tumultuous and dangerous year, 2023 could be just as fraught.\n\nWashington power shift\n\nWashington is bracing for a sharp shock. Since November, the big story has been about the red wave that didn\u2019t arrive. But the reality of divided government will finally dawn this week. A House Republican majority, in which radical conservatives now have disproportionate influence, will take over one half of Capitol Hill. Republicans will fling investigations, obstruction and possible impeachments at the White House, designed to throttle Biden\u2019s presidency and ruin his reelection hopes.\n\nIronically, voters who disdained Trump-style circus politics and election denialism will get more of it since the smaller-than-expected GOP majority means acolytes of the ex-president, like expected House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan of Ohio and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, will have significant sway. The new Republican-run House represents, in effect, a return to power of Trumpism in a powerful corner of Washington. If House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy wins his desperate struggle against his party\u2019s hardliners to secure the speakership, he\u2019ll be at constant risk of walking the plank after making multiple concessions to extreme right-wingers.\n\nA weak speaker and a nihilistic pro-Trump faction in the wider GOP threaten to produce a series of spending showdowns with the White House \u2013 most dangerously over the need to raise the government\u2019s borrowing authority by the middle of the year, which could throw the US into default if it\u2019s not done.\n\nAs Democrats head into the minority under a new generation of leaders, government shutdowns are more likely than bipartisanship. The GOP is vowing to investigate the business ties of the president\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, and the crisis at the southern border. The GOP could suffer, however, if voters think they overreached \u2013 a factor Biden will use as he eyes a second term.\n\nIn the Senate, Democrats are still celebrating the expansion of their tiny majority in the midterms. (After two years split at 50-50, the chamber is now 51-49 in their favor). Wasting no time in seeking to carve out a reputation among voters as a force for bipartisanship and effective governance, the president will travel to Kentucky this week. He\u2019ll take part in an event also featuring Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, to highlight the infrastructure package that passed with bipartisan support in 2021.\n\nThe potential earthquake of a Trump indictment\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland could shortly face one of the most fateful decisions in modern politics: whether to indict Trump over his attempt to steal the 2020 election and over his hoarding of classified documents.\n\nA criminal prosecution of an ex-president and current presidential candidate by the administration that succeeded him would subject the country\u2019s political and judicial institutions to more extreme strain than even Trump has yet managed. The ex-president has already claimed persecution over investigations he faces \u2013 and an early declaration of his 2024 campaign has given him the chance to frame them as politicized.\n\nIf Trump were indicted, the uproar could be so corrosive that it\u2019s fair to ask whether such an action would be truly in the national interest \u2013 assuming special counsel Jack Smith assembles a case that would have a reasonable chance of success in court.\n\nYet if Trump did indeed break the law \u2013 and given the strength of the evidence of insurrection against him presented in the House January 6 committee\u2019s criminal referrals \u2013 his case also creates an even more profound dilemma. A failure to prosecute him would set a precedent that puts ex-presidents above the law.\n\n\u201cIf a president can incite an insurrection and not be held accountable, then really there\u2019s no limit to what a president can do or can\u2019t do,\u201d outgoing Illinois GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a member of the select committee, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s not guilty of a crime, then I, frankly, fear for the future of his country because now every future president can say, \u2018Hey, here\u2019s the bar.\u2019 And the bar is, do everything you can to stay in power.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s already 2024\n\nLike it or not, with his November announcement, Trump has pitched America into the next presidential campaign. But unusual doubts cloud his future after seven years dominating the Republican Party. His limp campaign launch, bleating over his 2020 election loss and the poor track record of his hand-picked election-denying candidates in the midterms have dented Trump\u2019s aura.\n\nPotential alternative figureheads for his populist, nationalist culture war politics, like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, are emerging who could test the ex-president\u2019s bond with his adoring conservative base. Even as he fends off multiple investigations, Trump must urgently show he\u2019s still the GOP top dog as more and more Republicans consider him a national liability.\n\nBiden is edging closer to giving Americans a new piece of history \u2013 a reelection campaign from a president who is over 80. His success in staving off a Republican landslide in the midterms has quelled some anxiety among Democrats about a possible reelection run. And Biden\u2019s strongest card is that he\u2019s already beaten Trump once. Still, he wouldn\u2019t be able to play that card if Trump fades and another potential GOP nominee emerges. DeSantis, for example, is roughly half the current president\u2019s age.\n\nAs 2023 opens, a repeat White House duel between Trump and Biden \u2013 which polls show voters do not want \u2013 is the best bet. But shifting politics, the momentous events in the months to come and the vagaries of fate means there\u2019s no guarantee this will be the case come the end of the year.\n\nThe world is getting more dangerous\n\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last year showed how outside, global events can redefine a presidency. Biden\u2019s leadership of the West against Moscow\u2019s unprovoked aggression will be an impressive centerpiece of his legacy. But Russian President Vladimir Putin shows every sign of fighting on for years. Ukraine says it won\u2019t stop until all his forces are driven out. So Biden\u2019s capacity to stop the war from spilling over into a disastrous Russia-NATO clash will be constantly tested.\n\nAnd who knows how long US and European voters will stomach high energy prices and sending billions of taxpayer cash to arm Ukraine if Western economies dip into recession this year.\n\nBiden has his hands full elsewhere. An alarming airborne near miss between a Chinese jet and US military jet over the South China Sea over the holiday hints at how tensions in the region, especially over Taiwan, could trigger another superpower standoff. Biden also faces burgeoning nuclear crises with Iran and North Korea, which, along with Russia\u2019s nuclear saber rattling, suggests the beginning of a dangerous new era of global conflict and risk.\n\nThe economy on the brink\n\nRarely has an economy been so hard to judge. In 2022, 40-year-high inflation and tumbling stock markets coincided with historically low unemployment rates, which created an odd simultaneous sensation of economic anxiety and wellbeing. The key question for 2023 will be whether the Federal Reserve\u2019s harsh interest rate medicine \u2013 designed to bring down the cost of living \u2013 can bring about a soft landing without triggering a recession that many analysts believe is on the way.\n\nWashington spending showdowns and potential government shutdowns could also pose new threats to growth. The economy will be outside any political leader\u2019s capacity to control, but its state at the end of the year will play a vital role in an election that will define America, domestically and globally after 2024.", "label": "human"}

The drastic lifestyle change was precipitated by necessity, as Stevens is one of the 44 million Americans burdened by student loan debt, with a total of $108,100.\n\nStevens' previous life in Seattle, where he worked two jobs to cover rent and bills, was marked by financial struggles.

This financial insecurity motivated Stevens to sell his possessions and relocate to the bus.\n\nInitially, Stevens and his partner lived in his friend's spare room, but as rent increased, they opted for the bus. With limited space, they work from home and alternate using the larger workspace. While living in a bus has its drawbacks, such as harsh winters and limited storage, it has also allowed them to save money and maintain a comfortable lifestyle.\n\nStevens' decision to live in the bus is also a testament to his regret over taking out student loans to cover tuition at Seattle University's law school, only to leave the program without a degree.

{"text": "Hungarian-born US investor and philanthropist George Soros answers to questions after delivering a speech on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos on May 24, 2022. Fabrice Coffrini | AFP | Getty Images\n\nA nonprofit financed by billionaire George Soros quietly donated $140 million to advocacy organizations and ballot initiatives in 2021, plus another $60 million to likeminded charities. Soros, who personally donated $170 million during the 2022 midterms to Democratic candidates and campaigns on top of that, spread the additional largess through the Open Society Policy Center \u2014 a 501(c)(4) nonprofit that falls under the Soros-funded Open Society Foundations network, according to a copy of its 2021 tax filing, which was obtained by CNBC and is the most recent data available. The Open Society Policy Center also doled out $138 million to advocacy groups and causes in 2020. Two of Soros' children sit on its board, the tax filings and its website shows. The donations bring Soros' contributions to political campaigns and causes since January 2020 to roughly half a billion dollars \u2014 at the least \u2014 most of it steered through dark money nonprofit groups and going largely toward political causes aligned with Democratic Party. Soros' nonprofit donations don't always go directly to political causes. The funds sometimes flow from one of his nonprofits, then to another, before being spent on the advertising, organizing and social media campaigns that directly reach voters. Many of the Open Society Policy Center's 2021 donations weren't necessarily earmarked to help sway the midterm elections, according to the foundation's website. At the same time, Tom Watson, an editorial director at the Open Society Foundations, conceded in an email to CNBC that \"there are definitely some OSPC grants that went to organizations working to combat voter suppression, support voter registration and expand civic participation.\" Those are all core Democratic principals.\n\nComplex network of nonprofits\n\nThe foundation network includes several affiliated 501(c)(4) groups, a type of nonprofit under the U.S. tax code that's allowed to engage in political activities, as well as more traditional 501(c)(3) charitable organizations, its website and tax filing show. All of the nonprofits fall under Soros' Open Society Foundations network, which spans the globe. It describes itself as \"the world's largest private funder of independent groups working for justice, democratic governance, and human rights,\" and it has dozens of offices in the U.S., Europe, Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East. It additionally runs the Open Society University Network, which includes more than two dozen colleges across the world, sponsoring research projects through its Democracy Institute, among other initiatives. While not illegal, the complex network of related nonprofits, research funding and charities financed by Soros obfuscates the original origin of the donations. Through the network, Soros has donated more than $32 billion over the years, according to its website. It says it gives \"thousands of grants every year toward building inclusive and vibrant democracies,\" with active projects in more than 120 countries.\n\nWealthy special interests\n\n\"Wealthy special interests and individuals try to hide their influence in elections, including by funding politically active nonprofits, because they know that the messenger matters,\" Aaron McKean, an attorney at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center said. \"Voters have a right to know who is trying to influence elections so that they can make informed choices when filling out their ballot.\" The Open Society Policy Center's budget in 2021 was funded by a single $196 million donation from the Open Society Foundation network, according to foundation officials. An affiliated 501(c)(3) charitable group called the Open Society Institute received a $1.78 billion donation in QECL shares from the Foundation to Promote Open Society, which was founded and is funded by the billionaire businessman. In the U.S., the Open Society Policy Center donated to a variety of politically active groups and causes since the start of the 2020 election cycle, including $4.5 million in September to Reproductive Freedom for All, according to data from the nonpartisan watchdog OpenSecrets. The campaign backed Michigan's successful ballot initiative called Proposition 3 that enshrined abortion rights into the state's constitution. The group also gave $1 million in 2020 toward a campaign that supported an Oklahoma prison sentencing ballot measure titled Yes on 805. The ballot initiative would have ended repeat sentence penalties for nonviolent offenses in the state; it failed to pass during the 2020 election.\n\nHelping Democrats\n\nThe vast majority of Soros' personal donations during the 2022 cycle went to two super PACs: Democracy PAC and Democracy PAC II, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Both of those groups are run by the billionaire's son Alexander Soros, who also sits on the boards of the Open Society Institute and Open Society Policy Center. Politico reported that these PACs were meant to help Democratic candidates and groups in 2022, and in future election cycles. Records show that the Democracy PACs, which by law can raise and spend an unlimited amount of money, donated millions of dollars in the midterms to organizations that actively helped Democrats running for office, including support for the Senate Majority PAC and the House Majority PAC.

By the time of the Apollo 11 moon landing two years prior, the longest time humans spent in space was only about two weeks.\n\nThis Soviet crew had spent 23 days in space, setting a new record for human space flight endurance, and were finally coming home.\n\nAs the ship made its reentry, one crew communicator back in Yevpatoriya expressed concerns about the lack of reports from the cosmonauts.\n\n\"We asked Dobrovolskiy the whole time to give us a running commentary as soon as the Descent Module enters our coverage zone, but he hasn't said a word,\" crew communicator Aleksei Yeliseyev said, according to Boris Chertok, a space engineer who recounted the mission in his four-volume memoir \"Rockets and People.\" \"It's strange that Volkov is quiet. During the last session, he was very talkative.\"\n\nThe module carrying the men landed around 2 a.m., about 56 miles southwest of the town of Karazhal. A rescue team was immediately dispatched.\n\nChertok recalled there were another 20 minutes of silence when the team received no reports.\n\nFinally, one lead Soviet engineer, with a disturbed expression on his face, would break the news he received from Moscow: Seated \"in tranquil poses,\" Chertok wrote, the three cosmonauts were found dead inside the ship.\n\nAfter the moon race\n\nRussians watch a few-days-delayed broadcasting of the Apollo 11 moon landing in July 1969. Ullstein Bild/AP\n\nThe Soyuz 11 mission launched as the public's interest in the space arena waned.\n\nBy then, Apollo 11 landed on the moon in 1969, which many historians argue was the hallmark event that settled the Great Space Race between the US and the Soviet Union.\n\n\"I think there was a kind of fascination in the '60s with space, and this presented all sorts of cultural things like 'Star Trek,'\" Asif A. Siddiqi, a Fordham University history professor who wrote extensively on the Soviet space program and edited Chertok's memoirs, said in an interview with Insider. \"But I think after the moon race, people just lost interest. People were saying that there's deeper problems at home that we should be devoting our money to.\"\n\nStill, there was much to explore about space and many milestones yet to be broken.\n\nScientists had limited knowledge of the impacts of prolonged weightlessness on the human body, for example. The longest humans had spent in space by the time of the landmark moon landing was about two weeks.\n\n\"The Soviets were always interested in the long-term effects of human beings in space,\" Siddiqi said. \"You couldn't really think about going anywhere, like Mars, unless you really understood how the human body would react.\"\n\nTo recoup the loss of the moon race, the Soviets quickly pivoted to a space station program. They gathered existing equipment and hastily put together a space station that was launched on April 19, 1971. The ship was named Salyut 1 and was the world's first space station to orbit the Earth.\n\nThe first attempt to send cosmonauts to the ship occurred merely three days after Salyut 1's launch. But the four-man crew failed to dock and returned to Earth in less than two days.\n\nThe next attempt came during a notably \"perfect\" June in southern Kazakhstan, Chertok wrote.\n\n\"It had rained recently, accompanied by an unusually cold wind for that time of year,\" he recalled. \"As one might expect, the Tyuratam old-timers tried to convince us that they couldn't recall such a pleasant early June.\"\n\nThree men were assigned to Soyuz 11. However, just two days before the scheduled launch, the discovery of a spot \"the size of a chicken egg\" inside a flight engineer's right lung would alter the fate of the cosmonauts, according to Chertok.\n\nA backup crew consisting of Dobrovolsky, the commander, Volkov, the flight engineer, and Patasayev, a research engineer, would replace the primary team. One engineer rationalized: A \"new crew that hasn't worked together will be worse than the backup crew,\" Chertok wrote.\n\nAnother leap for mankind\n\nThe interior of Salyut 1 space station with the hatchway leading to the Soyuz 11 spacecraft.

The three cosmonauts would make a landmark achievement by successfully docking onto Salyut 1 the very next day.\n\nThe space station was of modest size \u2014 comparable to a two or three-bedroom apartment, according to Siddiqi. A lot of the research conducted inside Salyut 1 was related to biomedicine, but the crew performed a wide range of experiments.\n\nAccording to NASA, Patsayev was the first to operate a telescope in space. Inside the oasis chamber, the cosmonauts grew Chinese cabbage and onions. Patsayev became the first person to celebrate their birthday in space, and the men cast their ballots for the Soviet elections.\n\nScientists also wanted to closely monitor the impacts of space on the human body. A treadmill was installed on the Salyut 1 and the cosmonauts forwent their space suits in the space station and Soyuz.\n\n\"One of the things that they were envisioning is that they wanted to get rid of the space suits because they were trying to secure the spacecraft so that you wouldn't need space suits,\" Siddiqi said. \"It was a concession made in the early days when you weren't sure if the spaceships themselves were secure and safe. So they moved the safety consideration from the suit to the ship \u2026 And without the suits, you could put in more stuff, because it becomes spacious inside.\"\n\nThe cosmonauts experienced setbacks including a small fire on board as well as \"personality conflicts,\" according to Siddiqi, but the crew successfully breached an 18-day record also set by the Soviets in 1970.\n\nIn total, they spent about 22 days docked at the station. Chertok, the space engineer and author of \"Rockets and People,\" recalled the day the cosmonauts reached the milestone in his memoir with little fanfare.\n\n\"We departed from the Crimea after agreeing that Dobrovolskiy's crew should set a new record for time spent in space. A preliminary landing date of 30 June was set,\" he wrote.\n\nTragedy inside Soyuz 11\n\nDobrovolsky, Volkov, and Patsaev inside Soyuz 11. Keystone/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nAlmost everything about the Soyuz 11 spacecraft functioned as intended.\n\n\"The Soyuz spacecraft is a very automated ship, so you don't have to do much,\" Siddiqi said. \"The program to return the Soyuz just kept operating and it operated perfectly.\"\n\nThe descent module that carried the three men oriented itself, the parachute deployed, and in the early hours of June 30, 1971, the ship landed softly in the steppes of Kazakhstan. According to Chertok's memoir, a report also stated that the cosmonauts were in good physical condition in the last few days of their journey.\n\nBut a few missteps on the ship and by the Soviet space program led to the tragic deaths of the cosmonauts. Michael Smith, a Cold War historian at Purdue University who studied the Soviet space program, told Insider that he teaches Soyuz 11 \"as a case study in risk planning.\"\n\nSoyuz 11 consisted of three modules. At the front of the ship is a module that operates like the crew's workspace; in the middle is the cabin for the three men; and behind is the service module that carries the engine and power source.\n\nIn order to split the modules, small cartridges containing tiny explosives set off at a precise moment in a sequence. However, according to prevailing theory, the cartridges fired off at the same time, Siddiqi said.\n\nThe shock of the explosion caused a valve in the cabin to open while the ship was at a lethal altitude. The module quickly decompressed, and in a matter of seconds, the cosmonauts lost consciousness.\n\n\"Without space suits and emergency oxygen to protect them, the cosmonauts perished,\" Smith said.\n\nJust two minutes after landing, a rescue team in a helicopter made contact with the module lying on its side. Chertok recalled a report he heard from Kerim Kerimov, one of the key founders of the Soviet space program:\n\n\"They quickly opened the hatch. All three were sitting in their seats in tranquil poses. There were dark blue spots on their faces. Blood was running from the nose and ears. They pulled them out of the Descent Module. Dobrovolsky was still warm. Doctors continued to perform artificial resuscitation. According to their reports from the landing site, death was the result of asphyxiation.\"\n\nAn autopsy report conducted afterward made a \"harrowing impression,\" Chertok wrote:\n\n\"Mentally placing themselves into the Descent Module, everyone tried to imagine how the cosmonauts felt during those first seconds. The excruciating pain throughout their bodies prevented them from thinking and comprehending. Certainly, they heard the whistle of escaping air, but their eardrums quickly burst, and silence set in. Judging by the speed of the drop in pressure, they were able to actively move and attempt to do something for perhaps the first 15 to 20 seconds.\"\n\nThe valve opened at about a 105-mile altitude, above the Karman line \u2014 an imaginary boundary often used to determine when space flight is reached.\n\nDobrovolsky, Volkov, and Patsayev are the only humans to date to have died beyond that line.\n\nHad the cosmonauts been wearing space suits, the three men certainly could have survived the event of depressurization, Siddiqi said. However, another pitfall of the mission was insufficient testing, which was partly due to the haste created by the space race.\n\n\"A lot of failures in the spaceship don't appear immediately,\" Siddiqi said. \"You have to sometimes test it 50 times before something shows up. So they didn't fly these things enough to really know how it would react.\"\n\nWorld nations mourn\n\nCrowds march through Red Square in Moscow to mourn the death of the three cosmonauts. Keystone/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nA day of national mourning was held along with a massive state funeral, according to Time magazine. Condolences from Soviet leaders were extended to the men's families.\n\nIn a message to Nikolai Podgorny, the head of state of the Soviet Union at the time, President Richard Nixon wrote: \"The American people join me in expressing to you and the Soviet people our deepest sympathy on the tragic death of the three Soviet cosmonauts. The whole world followed the exploits of these courageous explorers of the unknown and shares the anguish of their tragedy. But the achievement of cosmonauts Dobrovolsky, Volkov, and Patsayev remains.\"\n\nAccording to Siddiqi, the death of the three cosmonauts had a lasting impact on the Soviet space program afterward. Another flight attempt wasn't made for more than two years.\n\n\"In retrospect, you don't want people to die, but it may have been the one thing that allowed the designers to stop and take a deep breath,\" he said.\n\nBy the late 1970s, there were no more fatalities. The Soviets launched the Salyut 6 space station in 1977 and was an indisputable success. Multiple large crews docked and undocked with the station, and the duration of the missions steadily increased from three months to six months.\n\n\"On a happier note, the subsequent Soviet redesigns and improvements to the Soyuz capsules (including space suits for ascent and descent) have been remarkably durable,\" Smith said. \"Soyuz 11 was that last fatal space disaster for the Soviet Union and Russian Federation.\"", "label": "human"}

The 1.9% increase was the largest of any US state over this period.\n\nAmple job opportunities \u2014 evidenced by one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation \u2014 and the growth of remote work have made it possible for many Americans to move to the Sunshine State. Many have also been drawn there because it's one of nine states with no state income tax, which could potentially save them thousands of dollars per year.\n\nWhen you look at the full picture, however, it's unclear if moving to Florida will prove to be a smart financial decision in the years to come. It all depends on where you work, which city you live in, and how much risk you're willing to take when it comes to homeownership, insurance, and healthcare.\n\nFlorida's home and rent costs are rising at some of the fastest rates in the US, and wages aren't keeping up\n\nA 2019 Joblist study that compared wages to cost of living in the US, ranked Florida last out of all 50 states in terms of affordability. That was before Americans flocked to the state over the last few years and caused home and rent prices to surge.\n\nIn 2022, five of the 20 most competitive US rental markets were in Florida, per RentCafe, with Miami-Dade county and Orlando at number one and three respectively. As of October, the cost of a one-bedroom apartment in the state had increased 36% since the start of the pandemic, per Apartment List, with only New Mexico and Idaho seeing a higher uptick. At roughly $1,420, only five states charged a higher monthly rent for the typical one-bedroom as of October.\n\nFor homebuyers, prices grew nearly 30% in Florida between the second quarter of 2021 and 2022, the most of any state. Its median home value, however, remains middle of the pack compared to the rest of the country.\n\n\"There's just no way for people living here to afford it \u2014 the salaries that they pay here don't add up to the cost of rent,\" Nicole Panesso, a millennial who lived in Florida her whole life until moving to Tennessee last year, previously told Insider.\n\nPer the Census Bureau, the median household income in Florida was roughly $62,000 in 2021, below the median US household income of roughly $71,000. A September ADP report, however, found that Florida's wage growth had outpaced the national inflation rate \u2014 if not the state's cost of living \u2014 over the prior 12 months.\n\nInsurance and healthcare are high, while overall taxes are low\n\nDue in part to weather concerns, the average Florida resident pays more than almost anyone else in the country for property insurance and car insurance. The total cost of car ownership, which includes gas prices and repair costs, is slightly above the national average.\n\nAdditionally, a November Forbes analysis using data from the Kaiser Family Foundation found Florida to be the fourth most expensive state for healthcare in the country, adding that residents with employer-provided family health coverage pay over $7,000 annually, the highest premium of any state. The elevated health insurance rates are in part because Florida's employers generally don't cover as much of the healthcare costs as those in other states do.\n\nDespite the lack of an income tax, Florida has higher sales and property taxes than some of its peers, and due to Florida law, newcomers are seeing higher property tax increases than longstanding residents. The state's overall tax burden, however, remains among the lowest in the nation, and is among the reasons so many retirees move there.\n\nWhat to consider before moving to Florida\n\nWhile Florida might not be the single most affordable state in the country, contrary to the Joblist study's claim, it's likely not the least affordable either.\n\nAmong the most expensive states to live in, \"Florida's not even in the top 10,\" University of Illinois economics professor David Albouy to The Associated Press last October.\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin economics professor Steven Deller agreed.\n\n\"Florida is above the national average, but it's not even close to the most expensive place to live,\" he said.\n\nThese comments were consistent with a 2022 CNBC analysis, which said Florida was the 27th best state in terms of cost of living.\n\nBefore moving to the Sunshine State, it's worth considering how Florida's cost of living compares to where you live now, and to your potential employment opportunities. In 2019, New York and Georgia saw the most residents move to Florida. Those from New York, which CNBC's analysis named the second most expensive state in terms of cost of living, might have benefitted from the move. However, those coming from Georgia \u2014 the 4th least expensive state \u2014 might have found themselves worse off financially.\n\nSome people may ultimately choose to move to Florida, but keep their remote job in a higher paying state. They may avoid the most competitive rental markets like Miami-Dade and Orlando. Others might choose to forego a car purchase or look for areas with more moderate property taxes or insurance costs.\n\nIndeed, the lack of an income tax is a major financial perk for Floridians. But it alone is not enough to justify a move to Florida \u2014 at least from a financial perspective.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "A forthcoming fiscal calendar for a specific subset of the American population has been publicly disclosed, and it appears to be an intriguing year for those reliant on these financial allocations. Amidst the current uncertainty surrounding this particular system and the ongoing debate regarding potential modifications, it is now an opportune moment to familiarize oneself with the forthcoming payment schedule.\n\nIt is essential to be cognizant of when one will receive these payments to ensure a well-structured monthly budget. This will facilitate the allocation of necessary funds at the appropriate time, thereby warranting attention to the payment schedule for the upcoming year.\n\nThe payment schedule for the forthcoming year will commence on January 3rd and will continue through December 28th. On January 3rd, payments for the preceding month will be processed, and it is advisable to update one's checking account information by this date to avoid any potential delays. Additionally, one can expect to receive these payments on the third Wednesday of every month.\n\nIn the event that one's payment date coincides with a federal holiday or weekend, the payment will be processed a day earlier. This means that if January 3rd falls on a holiday or weekend, the payment will be received on December 31st.\n\nApart from the regular payment schedule, there are also four \"catch-up\" payments dispersed throughout the year. These payments, which are distributed in April, July, October, and December, are designed to assist those who have fallen behind on their benefits due to financial hardship. The catch-up payment amount is equivalent to the difference between what an individual would normally receive each month and their regular payment amount.\n\nThe payment schedule for the forthcoming year also includes a COLA, or Cost-of-Living Adjustment, increase. This increase is adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI). For the upcoming year, the COLA increase is anticipated to be 2.6%, which is identical to the COLA increase for the preceding year.\n\nAlongside the payment schedule, there are also several other crucial dates to take note of. January 2nd marks the official commencement of Open Season, the period during which individuals can make adjustments to their Social Security benefits. During this period, individuals can modify their benefits, including altering their retirement age or increasing their benefit amount. Open Season concludes on March 17th, so it is advisable to make any necessary adjustments by that date.\n\nLastly, it is essential to remember that Social Security benefits can evolve over time. It is crucial to remain informed and updated on any modifications made to this system to ensure that one is receiving the amount of benefits to which they are entitled.\n\nUnderstanding the payment schedule for the forthcoming year is vital for planning one's financial future. Knowledge of when to expect payments will facilitate the creation of a well-structured budget, and the COLA increase and Open Season are significant dates to be aware of. By staying informed and updated on Social Security, one can ensure that they are receiving the benefits to which they are entitled.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "A recent Supreme Court hearing has sparked uncertainty about the fate of a federal provision aimed at eliminating cash bail nationwide. The SAFE-T Act, passed in 2019, was challenged in 2020 by a coalition of sheriffs and court clerks, who argued that the law overstepped federal authority and was unconstitutional.\n\nThe SAFE-T Act was part of the First Step Act, a comprehensive criminal justice reform bill that aimed to address disparities between low-level and serious offenders. The law eliminated the federal cash bail system, which had allowed accused individuals to remain in jail until they could afford to post bail.\n\nThe challengers claimed that the federal government had exceeded its authority by superseding state governments' ability to set bail policies. They also argued that the law was overly burdensome and costly, with insufficient flexibility in granting bail.\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer acknowledged the issues with cash bail, citing evidence of racial disparities in the criminal justice system. However, he expressed skepticism about the federal government's authority to enact such a change, noting that bail reform typically falls within state jurisdiction.\n\nGiven the concerns voiced by the majority of the court and the two Biden appointees, it appears unlikely that the Supreme Court will rule in favor of the provision.

{"text": "Cardiac arrest is a critical situation that necessitates swift intervention. It occurs when the heart abruptly ceases to beat and pump blood throughout the body. Prompt action is vital when someone is experiencing cardiac arrest.\n\n Familiarity with the warning signs of cardiac arrest and having a pre-planned response strategy can significantly enhance the chances of saving a life. It is also crucial to comprehend the appropriate actions to take when someone experiences cardiac arrest and how to identify it in others.\n\nThe signs of cardiac arrest include sudden loss of consciousness, absence of breathing or gasping breaths, no pulse, and a bluish or grayish skin tone. It is essential to check for a pulse and breathing as soon as possible. If none are present, immediately contact emergency services and initiate chest compressions.\n\nWhen someone is in cardiac arrest, the most critical step is to contact emergency services and initiate chest compressions. Chest compressions facilitate the circulation of oxygen-rich blood throughout the body, thereby increasing the likelihood of a successful resuscitation. The optimal technique for performing chest compressions involves placing the heel of one hand in the center of the chest and pushing down with the other hand to a depth of approximately two inches. This should be repeated at a rate of at least 100 times per minute.\n\nUpon the arrival of the ambulance, the medical team will assume care and employ a defibrillator to deliver an electric shock to the heart in an attempt to restore its normal rhythm. The medical team will also provide oxygen and medications, such as epinephrine, to counteract the effects of cardiac arrest.\n\nIt is essential to recognize that cardiac arrest can affect anyone, regardless of age or health history. Consequently, it is vital to be prepared and knowledgeable about the appropriate actions to take when someone is experiencing cardiac arrest. Take the time to review the steps and familiarize yourself with the signs and symptoms of cardiac arrest. This could ultimately save a life.\n\nAlthough chest compressions are the most effective means of assisting someone in cardiac arrest, bystanders can also utilize an AED (automated external defibrillator). An AED is a device that delivers an electric shock to the heart to restore its normal rhythm. AEDs are widely available in public areas, and many are user-friendly. Most AEDs come equipped with voice instructions, ensuring the user knows exactly what to do.\n\nWhen utilizing an AED, it is crucial to ensure the person receiving the shock is lying on a flat, dry surface. Carefully follow all instructions, as incorrect use of an AED can be hazardous.\n\nIn the event of cardiac arrest, prompt action and seeking help are essential.

{"text": "For the inaugural occasion in the program's chronicle, TCU has secured a place in the College Football Playoff National Championship. The No. 11 Horned Frogs executed a thrilling 51-45 victory over Michigan in the Fiesta Bowl, with quarterback Trevone Boykin contributing four total touchdowns.\n\nThe electrifying game was the highest-scoring Fiesta Bowl in history, featuring four lead changes and a captivating conclusion. The game seemed to be concluded when TCU took a 51-45 lead with just over two minutes to play, but Michigan drove inside the Horned Frogs 10-yard line with less than 10 seconds to play. However, the Wolverines' hopes of a game-tying touchdown were extinguished when Jabrill Peppers fumbled the ball out of the end zone, preserving TCU's win.\n\nThe game commenced with both teams exchanging scores, as Boykin and Wolverines quarterback Wilton Speight each threw for a pair of touchdown passes in the first half. The Frogs' defense made a stand late in the second quarter, forcing a quick three-and-out and setting up a long drive for TCU. The Horned Frogs utilized the remainder of the half, with Boykin finding Josh Doctson in the end zone from 25 yards out to give TCU a 28-17 lead heading into the half.\n\nThe TCU defense was the focal point in the second half. The Frogs forced Michigan into four three-and-outs in the half, and held the Wolverines to just 48 yards of total offense in the third quarter. Boykin added to his impressive stat line in the fourth quarter, throwing his fourth touchdown pass of the game, a 47-yard strike to Doctson, to put TCU up by 11.\n\nSpeight made one final push for the Wolverines, connecting on three consecutive touchdown passes to Peppers to bring the game within three. But the TCU defense held firm, forcing the Wolverines to turn it over on downs with 1:13 to play. The Frogs then ran out the clock, securing the historic win and a spot in the national championship game.\n\nBoykin concluded the game with 386 passing yards and four touchdowns, and added 94 yards and two scores on the ground. Doctson was Boykin's primary target, hauling in nine passes for 180 yards and two scores. Defensively, TCU was led by cornerback Ranthony Texada, who recorded three tackles and two pass breakups.\n\nThe victory marks TCU's first win in a major bowl game since the 2011 Rose Bowl, and is the most significant win in the Gary Patterson era. The Horned Frogs now have an opportunity to make history, as they are just the second Big 12 team in the playoff era to reach the national championship game.

{"text": "Jake McCabe has been the reliable, smart, effective defensive defenseman with a touch of offensive ability this season that the Blackhawks thought they were getting last season.\n\nThe ironic part is McCabe has become the right player at the wrong time.\n\nWhen ex-Hawks general manager Stan Bowman signed McCabe to a four-year contract in 2021, he thought the former Sabre would play a big part in the Hawks\u2019 defensive stabilization. But McCabe \u2014 still hampered by the shoulder that had undergone surgery the winter before \u2014 struggled mightily out of the gate, along with the rest of the team, and never really found his rhythm.\n\nNow under GM Kyle Davidson, McCabe\u2019s age (29) and term (2.5 years left under contract) no longer fit the organizational timeline, especially with so many prospect defensemen pushing toward the NHL.\n\nBut McCabe has nonetheless finally settled into the role Bowman imagined him filling. He has arguably been the Hawks\u2019 best player this season.\n\nAnd he produced one of his best performances in the Hawks\u2019 2-0 shutout win Friday over the Coyotes, even beyond his 89 mile-per-hour slapshot goal.\n\n\u201cWatching him in the third period, making street-hockey [style] kick saves in front of the goalie, he\u2019s a warrior,\u201d coach Luke Richardson said. \u201cHe\u2019s not afraid to put his body on the line for the team. It was great to see him get rewarded on the offensive side, but [it was] just a real good complete game by him and Seth [Jones]. They were both excellent tonight.\u201d\n\nPutting McCabe with Jones, who may not be quite deserving of his 2023 NHL All-Star selection but is unquestionably a good player, has proven to be a wise move. Both have benefited from getting away from Jack Johnson.\n\n\u201cMe and Seth as of late, as a pair, have been playing pretty solid,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cWe played really well [Friday]. We moved pucks quickly, we didn\u2019t spend too much time in our \u2018D\u2019-zone and we were just solid throughout the game, with good gaps reading off each other. [We\u2019ve been] getting more comfortable with each other the last couple weeks.\u201d\n\nMcCabe mentioned his gap control again in a follow-up question about what has contributed most to his success this season, and he\u2019s absolutely correct about that.\n\nThe Hawks are generally atrocious at defending their own blue line, but McCabe\u2019s physicality, strong positioning and awareness of his partner\u2019s positioning make him the lone exception. He\u2019s the only Hawks defenseman who grades out above-average in both total zone entry targets and zone entries allowed leading to scoring chances, per data from All Three Zones.\n\nMeanwhile, his 44.6% expected-goals ratio and 42.8% scoring-chance ratio at five-on-five may not look pretty, but he\u2019s the best Hawks defenseman in both those categories, too. Plus, he also not only leads the Hawks but entered Saturday tied for ninth in the NHL with 83 blocked shots.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s [even] blocking shots when the game is out of reach with a minute to go,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s doing it either way, if we\u2019re down three goals or we\u2019re up four.\u201d\n\nOffensively, McCabe\u2019s 10 points now rank second among Hawks defensemen, behind only Jones. He\u2019s cautious about pinching, but he typically makes a positive impact when he does. Since the Hawks\u2019 early-December win at the Rangers, a game in which he was very active in the \u2018O\u2019-zone, he has been doing that more.\n\nAnd although plus-minus is a flawed stat, the fact he sports a plus-three rating on a team with a minus-59 goal differential is so absurd that it\u2019s worth noting.\n\n\u201cI try to be the leader on the back end,\u201d he said. \u201cReally, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been focusing on all year: being steady and confident. Just keep the good things going when they\u2019re going good.\u201d", "label": "human"}
{"text": "As tensions between Ukraine and its separatist adversaries in the east escalate, a novel source of concern for the country has emerged: the proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) manufactured by a prominent Middle Eastern nation.\n\nA recent report from the International Crisis Group (ICG) highlights the significant impact of these low-cost, high-tech drones on the conflict's dynamics. The report suggests that the drones have enabled separatists to conduct frequent reconnaissance missions over territories under their control, posing an \"alarming\" threat to Ukrainian combat forces.\n\nWhat's more, the report emphasizes that the drones are extremely difficult to intercept, and the cost to do so can range from $20,000 to $500,000. The report also notes that the drones can be equipped with various payloads, including high-resolution cameras, infrared imaging, and even explosives for use in \"kamikaze\" missions.\n\nThe ICG report underscores the growing concern about the proliferation of drones in conflict zones, citing their use in other separatist conflicts, such as those in Libya, Syria, and Yemen. The report urges governments to cooperate more closely to reduce the proliferation of drones and better equip their forces to counter them.\n\nA senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute emphasized that governments need to take a proactive approach to addressing the potential security threats posed by the proliferation of drones. The fellow suggested that a systematic effort to prevent transfers to unstable areas, require disclosure of the origin of drones, restrict the sale to certain individuals, and impose other measures to ensure the market isn\u2019t dominated by these types of weapons would be an effective way to respond to this challenge.\n\nThe report also highlights the need for governments to consider strategies to limit the availability of these technologies, particularly to non-state actors, and to address the need for tighter regulation of the global drone market and more effective export control regimes.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Cursive Is History\n\nGen Z never learned to read cursive, Drew Gilpin Faust wrote in the October 2022 issue. How will they interpret the past?\n\nDrew Gilpin Faust\u2019s article on students\u2019 inability to read cursive reminded me of a similar lack of knowledge that I encountered years ago, when I was teaching at the University of Colorado. I had assigned my students timed presentations. There were no clocks in our classrooms (supposedly too distracting), so I brought in a portable analog clock. To my surprise, none of my students could read it\u2014they only told time on their cellphones.\n\nNaomi Rachel\n\nBoulder, Colo.\n\nExplore the January/February 2023 Issue Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. View More\n\nAs a professional calligrapher, an advocate for the continued practice of cursive, and a lover of handwriting, I share the wistfulness Drew Gilpin Faust expresses over the decline of cursive. And while I admit that in a practical sense, writing is a technology, I must add that it\u2019s an art form too, a thing of beauty regardless of skill level or perfection of form. It\u2019s a wondrous visual reminder of individuality and adds an element of artistry and humanness to everyday life.\n\nRecently, I was scribing gift notes at a retailer in New York City and a teenage boy watched over my shoulder curiously as I used an oblique dip pen and inkwell. I was shocked when he asked what language I was writing in: I realized that to kids who haven\u2019t learned script, I may as well be writing in cuneiform. Perhaps there\u2019s a future for me in antiquities translation.\n\nRita Polidori O\u2019Brien\n\nStaten Island, N.Y.\n\nLike Drew Gilpin Faust, I too will grieve the loss of the art of cursive writing. I was a third-grade teacher, and one of the goals of that grade was to transition the students from printing to cursive. The lessons started in September, and by January all schoolwork was to be in cursive.\n\nBy spring, a wee little miracle always occurred. Despite the rote instruction each child received, every student organically stylized their own penmanship. Some wrote in concise, blocky letters; others were more florid and ornate. By May, an unsigned test or report was easily recognizable by the student\u2019s penmanship and returned to the owner, like a note passed secretly between friends.\n\nThe loss of cursive will be a loss of individuality that today\u2019s students won\u2019t even know they\u2019ve suffered\u2014but I will.\n\nRebecca Lee\n\nRocky River, Ohio\n\nWhen I was in grammar school in the 1950s, we were taught cursive in the third grade, after having learned the ABCs in caps and lowercase during the two years before. Bad penmanship was admonished, and corrected. We practiced.\n\nToday I work as a lawyer, and I always have two lines for signatures\u2014the signed name and the printed name below. This is because 100 percent of the time the former is illegible.\n\nRecently I had to examine old land transfers in the New York City deeds records. The books, dating from the 1940s, had handwritten records of titles, names, and land-lot numbers. I was struck by the sureness of the clerks\u2019 script, the clarity of their handwriting\u2014it was quite beautiful. Line after line of exactitude and symmetry. And this just to record the ordinary.\n\nStephen M. Zelman\n\nNew York, N.Y.\n\nDrew Gilpin Faust replies:\n\nI am grateful for the surprising outpouring of responses to my article\u2014in letters to the magazine, on social media, and in my own email box\u2014because they underscored my sense that cursive\u2019s decline marks a meaningful generational divide and cultural transition. The messages could provide material for an article of their own\u2014touching stories of early pedagogical encounters sent by students and teachers alike, tales of the joy of mastery and artistry involved in learning cursive, and comments from dissenters ready to bid farewell to cursive with no regrets. One of my favorites of those came from a father who noted that, after all, his son hasn\u2019t learned to churn butter. But the many moving tributes to cursive leave me convinced that it is far from dead, and not going quietly.\n\nLet Puerto Rico Be Free\n\nThe only just future for the archipelago is not statehood, but full independence from the United States, Jaquira D\u00edaz argued in the November 2022 issue.\n\nAs a Puerto Rican who has lived on the island my entire life and as a state representative who favors statehood, I found Jaquira D\u00edaz\u2019s article on our political situation deeply misleading. Its title suggests that Puerto Rico wants to be free but has not yet been allowed to be. Even worse, it argues that independence represents the \u201conly just future\u201d for us. The problem with these claims, and the cherry-picked historical summary to support them, is simple: In the last major plebiscite on the island, the political option with the most support was statehood and some form of free association with the U.S. Independence may well be a legitimate option preferred by the author and others, but how can the \u201conly just\u201d alternative consistently be the one least supported by the people? Statehood and independence supporters can agree that the decolonization of Puerto Rico is a moral imperative for the United States, but from beginning to end, that process must be centered on respect for and adherence to the democratic will of the Puerto Rican people.\n\nJos\u00e9 Bernardo M\u00e1rquez\n\nToa Baja, Puerto Rico\n\nFrom the Archives\n\nIn \u201cCan a Building Be Too Tall?,\u201d Bianca Bosker explores the engineering feats that have propelled skyscrapers to new heights. High-rises began dotting the New York skyline in the late 1800s, she writes\u2014but not to universal acclaim.\n\nIn The Atlantic\u2019s October 1902 issue, the author Burton J. Hendrick railed against the \u201clatest manifestation\u201d of skyscraper design, writing that it \u201cconsists of a succession of prosaic stories \u2026 its monotony unrelieved by the slightest ornamentation.\u201d He was also concerned that the structures blocked sunlight, lowering the value of neighboring properties. Hendrick concluded, with some relief, that \u201cthe mania for mere bigness is subsiding.\u201d He predicted that the large-office-building \u201ccraze\u201d would ease up.\n\nFrom the October 1902 issue: Limitations to the production of skyscrapers\n\nBut the desire to build ever taller hasn\u2019t gone away, and neither have concerns about sunlight.

{"text": "The following is a narrative about an individual's personal experience and financial situation.\n\nIn recent years, the concept of online dating has become increasingly popular, with numerous platforms available for users to connect with one another. To provide insight into the various options, a list of the top 20 dating websites in the UK has been compiled.\n\nThe Sugar Baby scene has also gained significant attention in the past five years, with an estimated 120,000 individuals involved in the UK alone. This phenomenon involves individuals, primarily young women, signing up to dating websites and being matched with 'sugar daddies' or 'sugar mamas' who agree to compensate them for their time.\n\nI am one of the 120,000 individuals involved in this scene, and I have been able to earn an impressive $80,000 per year as a 'sugar baby'. I make money by spending time with men who are willing to pay for my companionship.\n\nI had an average upbringing, growing up in a lower-middle-class family in London as an only child. It was clear from an early age that money was limited, and I was never given any special privileges or opportunities. My childhood was not particularly happy, and I vowed to make something of my life from a young age.\n\nAfter completing my education, I attended university but did not finish my degree. Instead, I secured a job at a cafe, which did not align with my career aspirations but provided financial stability. I later transitioned to a career in retail, where I was promoted, but struggled to earn the income I desired.\n\nFeeling unfulfilled, I decided to take a risk and start my own business. I borrowed money from my parents, which was a significant burden for them, and established a shop selling handmade jewelry.\n\nAlthough my business was successful, I still struggled to make ends meet. It was at this point that I was introduced to the world of sugar babies. A friend recommended a website, suggesting that I could earn a substantial income by signing up.\n\nI was skeptical at first but decided to give it a try. I was amazed by the number of men who reached out to me, and I realized that I had something they desired - companionship and attention.\n\nI had a few dates that went well, but I soon received an offer from a middle-aged, wealthy businessman who was willing to pay me a significant sum of money to be in his company. We were both honest with each other, agreeing that our relationship would be platonic.\n\nThe amount he offered was too good to refuse, and I accepted. We have been together for over a year, and he pays me $80,000 per year for my companionship. We go on dates, attend events, and enjoy each other's company.\n\nI feel grateful to have found such an amazing relationship, and the financial benefits have enabled me to repay my parents and provide financial support for my business. I also have the freedom to travel and explore, which has brought me immense joy.\n\nI would encourage any woman looking to supplement her income and gain more freedom to consider becoming a sugar baby.

{"text": "LONDON, Dec 29 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Tough times mean tough decisions. In recent years more shoppers have forked out for organic and plant-based food. But persistent inflation and skimpier incomes, coupled with high input costs, will make it a tough year for conscious consumers and the companies that serve them.\n\nTake plant-based meat substitutes. They produce 30%-90% fewer emissions than their animal-derived counterparts, but a pound of the stuff costs shoppers twice as much, according to the Good Food Institute, a think tank. That puts fake meat on the chopping block when buyers are watching their wallets. Numerator, a market researcher, reckons 29.8% of U.S. households bought planted-based meat alternatives in the year to Sept. 30 \u2013 1.1 percentage points lower than in the previous 12 months.\n\nIt\u2019s part of a broader onset of eco apathy. Market researcher Kantar surveyed attitudes towards plastic use among almost 100,000 consumers in 24 markets. The proportion of shoppers who were \u201chighly concerned\u201d about waste and took action accordingly was down 4 percentage points year-on-year to just 18%. Meanwhile 44% of consumers were uninterested and took little to no action, a 7 percentage point increase.\n\nReuters Graphics\n\nCompanies that have been riding the sustainability wave are preparing for leaner times. Beyond Meat (BYND.O), a maker of plant-based burgers, announced in October that it was laying off 19% of its workforce and targeting positive operating cash flow in the second half of 2023. But weak demand will weigh on its top line, while high input costs will pressure margins. The price of U.S. pea protein isolate \u2013 a key ingredient in many meat substitutes \u2013 rose 10% between April 2021 and November 2022, according to Mintec Benchmark Prices. Forecasts compiled by Refinitiv suggest Beyond Meat\u2019s revenue will shrink almost 1% in 2023, and its operating cash flow is still projected to be negative in the second half of the year. Sales at Oatly (OTLY.O), which makes milk substitutes from oats, are projected to grow 25%, but it may still have to raise money.\n\nThere are some signs of hope for ethical consumers. UBS analysts note that significant rises in the price of grain, used in animal feed, could push up the cost of conventional meat more than that of plant-based alternatives. That would edge meat substitutes closer to their goal of one day costing the same, or less, than their animal-based equivalents. But in the meantime, 2023 looks set to leave a sour taste.\n\nFollow @olivertaslic on Twitter\n\n(This is a Breakingviews prediction for 2023.

{"text": "A leading PC manufacturer is reportedly planning to shift away from Chinese-made semiconductors by 2024. The company, known for its consumer laptops, desktops, and servers, has been exploring alternative chip sources to reduce its reliance on Chinese products. A source familiar with the matter revealed that the company has been researching and developing semiconductor products for some time and is now looking to integrate them into its products over the next few years.\n\nThe company's decision is seen as a response to growing concerns about the US's dependence on China for its semiconductor supplies, which is viewed as a major national security issue. The US has accused China of intellectual property theft and other economic crimes, leading to tariffs on Chinese goods and restrictions on Chinese investments and technology.\n\nOther companies have also been exploring ways to diversify their chip supplies. Apple has announced plans to bring its chip production to the US, while Qualcomm is considering expanding chip production in the US.\n\nThe PC manufacturer's decision may be driven in part by a need to remain competitive in the global market. China is the world's largest supplier of PCs, and if the company shifts away from Chinese chips, it could put it at a disadvantage to rivals. The move could also be driven by the company's policy of avoiding political risk, as it has declared itself to be neutral in the US-China trade conflict.\n\nThe impact of the company's decision on the semiconductor market is yet to be seen. While it may not be enough to offset the US's reliance on Chinese chips, it could help to reduce the impact of Chinese-made products on US technology markets. For now, the company is exploring its options and looking into ways to replace Chinese chips in its products.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "The majestic felines\n\nThe Chicago Felines were dealt a tough lesson in the first half of their home opener against the Detroit Lions on Sunday night at Soldier Field. \n\nIn a battle of two of the NFC North's biggest rivals, the Felines found themselves trailing the Lions 21-14 at halftime despite a historic performance by quarterback Justin Fields. \n\nFields, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, put on a show for the home crowd in the first half. He threw for 162 yards and two touchdowns and also scrambled for 107 yards on 10 carries. \n\nIt was the most rushing yards by a Felines quarterback in the first half since 1946 and the most in a half by any Felines player since the NFL-AFL merger in 1970. \n\nDespite the strong first-half performance, the Felines found themselves behind the Lions on the scoreboard. \n\nThe Lions took the lead on their second drive of the game, with quarterback Jared Goff orchestrating an 8-play, 75-yard drive that ended with a 15-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Kenny Golladay. \n\nThe Felines quickly answered, however, with a 9-play, 75-yard drive that was capped off by a 17-yard touchdown pass from Fields to wide receiver Allen Robinson. \n\nThe Lions then scored the next two touchdowns, both on the ground. Running back Adrian Peterson scored from two yards out to make it 14-7, and rookie D'Andre Swift capped off a 6-play, 59-yard drive with a 4-yard touchdown run to put the Lions ahead 21-7. \n\nThe Felines, though, found the end zone one more time before the half. Fields connected with tight end Cole Kmet on a 14-yard touchdown pass to cut the Lions' lead to 21-14. \n\nAt the start of the second half, the Felines were faced with a third-and-11 from their own 24-yard line. They called a timeout to discuss their play call, and when they came out of the break, Fields hit wide receiver Darnell Mooney on a slant route for 15 yards and a first down. \n\nThe drive eventually stalled, though, as the Felines had to settle for a Robbie Gould field goal to make it 21-17. \n\nThe game remained tight from then on, with both defenses forcing three-and-outs. The Lions, however, managed to find the end zone one more time on a 9-play, 75-yard drive that was capped off by a 4-yard touchdown run by Swift. \n\nWith the Lions leading 28-17, the Felines had one more chance to make something happen, but Fields was intercepted on the Felines' final possession of the game, sealing the victory for Detroit. \n\nThe loss was a disappointing end to an otherwise impressive performance from Fields. He finished the game with 286 passing yards and two touchdowns, as well as 122 rushing yards and one touchdown. \n\nThe Felines will look to rebound next week when they travel to Green Bay to take on the Packers. For now, however, they'll have to settle for being on the wrong end of a 28-17 score in their home opener.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "The Chicago Bears have undergone a drastic transformation from potential Super Bowl contenders to potential top-two draft picks in a short period.\n\nThe team announced on Tuesday that quarterback Justin Fields, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, will miss the remainder of the regular season due to a knee injury. In his absence, the team will start veteran Nathan Peterman in Week 18 and beyond, as the Bears aim to secure a top-two draft pick for the 2022 NFL Draft.\n\nFields, who was taken after Trevor Lawrence in the draft, was expected to be the face of the franchise for the foreseeable future. However, the former Ohio State Buckeye suffered a sprained MCL in last week's loss to the Minnesota Vikings, prompting the Bears to shut him down for the remainder of the regular season.\n\nThe safety and well-being of our players are of paramount importance, said Bears general manager Ryan Pace. We felt it was best to take a cautious approach with Justin and shut him down for the remainder of the regular season.\n\nThe Bears, who began the season with playoff aspirations, now find themselves in a challenging situation. With a 5-9 record, they are in prime position to claim one of the top-two picks in the 2022 NFL Draft, but their chances will depend on the performance of Peterman.\n\nThe 27-year-old was signed by the Bears in late October after being released by the Buffalo Bills. He has not thrown a regular-season pass since 2018, but he will be starting for the Bears for the remainder of the season.\n\nWe are confident in Nathan's ability to execute our offense and lead our team, said Pace. Nathan is a talented passer who has experience in our offense. We look forward to seeing him play and finish the season on a high note.\n\nThe Bears have a tough task ahead of them if they want to secure the top-two pick in the draft. Their final three games are against playoff contenders in the Jacksonville Jaguars, Baltimore Ravens, and New Orleans Saints.\n\nHowever, if they can manage to pull off an upset in any of those games, they could be in a prime position to grab a franchise-changing player like Clemson's Trevor Lawrence, Alabama's Mac Jones, or Ohio State's Justin Fields.\n\nFor now, the Bears will focus on the task at hand, starting with their Week 18 matchup against the Jaguars. Despite their current position, the team remains determined to finish the season on a high note.\n\nWe want to take advantage of the opportunity to play and compete each week, regardless of our record, said head coach Matt Nagy. We are focused on doing everything we can to finish the season strong.\n\nWith Fields out, the Bears' playoff chances are all but over. However, the team can still play a major role in determining how the top of the 2022 NFL Draft shakes out. For that reason, the eyes of the football world will be watching to see how the Bears fare down the stretch with Peterman at quarterback.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "On a frigid and snowy day in Buffalo, New York, a stalwart individual, Denny Kellington, a skilled practitioner in the medical field, rendered life-saving assistance to Damar Hamlin.\n\nHead coach Sean McDermott relayed the extraordinary events at a press conference on Monday, following the team's return from an away game in Pittsburgh.\n\n\"During the fourth quarter of the game, Damar Hamlin attempted a play, but unfortunately, he suffered a severe tackle,\" McDermott explained.\n\n\"The medical staff promptly recognized the gravity of the situation and summoned assistance. Trainer Denny Kellington, observing the commotion, swiftly hastened to the field to provide aid.\n\n\"Denny perceived that Damar had ceased breathing and administered life-saving cardiopulmonary resuscitation on the field, thereby saving his life. Without Denny's prompt thinking and expertise, we would not be gathered here today.\"\n\nThe team was relieved to learn the news, and the players expressed their profound gratitude towards Kellington. Wide receiver Zay Jones expressed his heartfelt appreciation.\n\n\"I find it challenging to adequately convey my gratitude to Denny for saving Damar's life,\" Jones said. \"He acted with remarkable speed, and we're all deeply thankful for his actions.\"\n\nMcDermott also emphasized the significance of having highly trained medical professionals on the sidelines, as they play a crucial role in ensuring player safety.\n\n\"I cannot stress enough the importance of having a highly skilled medical staff on the sidelines,\" McDermott said. \"The coaches cannot be everywhere, and the trainers occupy a vital role in the safety of our players.\n\n\"Denny has been an integral part of this team for many years, and we're all grateful for his presence on Saturday. He's a true hero, and we wouldn't have been able to save Damar without him.\"\n\nHamlin is expected to make a full recovery and should return to the field soon. Kellington has been awarded the Bills' Coaches' Award for his efforts and will be honored by the team later this season.\n\n\"Denny is the genuine hero here,\" said McDermott. \"He was in the right place at the right time, and I can't adequately express my gratitude for what he did.\"\n\nThe medical staff and the Buffalo Bills have received widespread acclaim for their swift response in the face of the emergency, and Kellington is a true hero for his actions on the field.

{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe House select committee investigating January 6, 2021, on Friday released another wave of witness interview transcripts.\n\nThe new drop, which complements the panel\u2019s sweeping 845-page report and is among a steady stream of transcripts released over the past week, includes interviews with some of the most intriguing figures in the committee\u2019s probe into the US Capitol attack.\n\nThose witnesses include Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019s wife, Ginni Thomas, who told the committee that she regretted texts she sent to Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows encouraging election reversal efforts.\n\nTrump White House deputy chief of staff Tony Ornato \u2013 whose interview transcript was also released Friday after the committee publicly questioned his credibility in its report \u2013 pushed back on another key witness\u2019 claim that he had recounted to her a dramatic episode involving Trump in his motorcade.\n\nFormer Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, meanwhile, shed new light on how a Trump team shift in strategy came to be.\n\nThe latest transcript drop comes as the panel winds down its work with the House majority set to change hands from Democrats to Republicans next week at the start of the new Congress. The releases have shed new light on how the House committee conducted its investigation of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol \u2013 and new details about what key witnesses told the panel.\n\nHere are some of the highlights from the latest disclosures:\n\nTrump wanted to trademark \u2018Rigged Election!\u2019 days after 2020 election, emails show\n\nThen-President Donald Trump wanted to trademark the phrase \u201cRigged Election!\u201d days after Election Day in 2020, according to emails provided by Jared Kushner to the House select committee.\n\nOn November 9, 2020, then-Trump aide Dan Scavino emailed Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, with the request from Trump.\n\n\u201cHey Jared! POTUS wants to trademark/own rights to below, I don\u2019t know who to see \u2013 or ask\u2026I don\u2019t know who to take to,\u201d the email from Scavino reads, according to a transcript of Kushner\u2019s testimony to the committee, which was released by the panel on Friday.\n\nTwo phrases were bolded in the email: \u201cSave America PAC!\u201d and \u201cRigged Election!\u201d\n\nKushner forwarded the request and discussed it on an email chain that included Eric Trump, the president\u2019s son; Alex Cannon, a Trump campaign lawyer; Sean Dollman, the chief financial officer of Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign; and Justin Clark, a Trump campaign lawyer.\n\n\u201cGuys - can we do ASAP please?\u201d Kushner wrote.\n\nEric Trump responded, saying: \u201cBoth web URLs are already registered. Save America PAC was registered October 23 of this year. Was that done by the campaign?\u201d\n\nDollman responded: \u201c\u2018Save America PAC\u2019 is already taken/registered, just confirming that. But we can still file for \u2018Save America.\u2019\u201d\n\nKushner\u2019s response, according to the transcript, was: \u201cGo.\u201d\n\nGiuliani explains Trump team pivot to state legislatures\n\nA feeling that courts weren\u2019t comfortable with Trump\u2019s legal challenges to the 2020 election drove the Trump team\u2019s pivot to state legislatures, former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani told the select committee earlier this year.\n\nThe theory that the US Constitution lets state legislatures intervene in the presidential election results first came up within the week after the election, Giuliani told congressional investigators. But he and then-fellow Trump attorney Jenna Ellis looked more closely at the idea when the lawsuits challenging the results weren\u2019t getting traction.\n\n\u201cWe just got a bad feeling that these judges didn\u2019t \u2013 they didn\u2019t want to hear witnesses, citizens, American citizens, and that if American citizens could get up and testify, there were so many of them that it would make a very big difference,\u201d Giuliani said in his May deposition.\n\nThe theory that a state legislature could override the results of a state\u2019s presidential vote is considered a fringe one, and Congress recently enacted statutory changes to limit legislatures\u2019 ability to do so.\n\nAt one point, Giuliani said, \u201cIt seemed to me the courts didn\u2019t want to be involved in a political question like this. And there was a kind of a discomfort too. Somehow we were trying to think, well, who would resolve something like this. And we started reading the Constitution.\u201d\n\nGinni Thomas explains why she was \u2018disgusted\u2019 with Pence in text sent days after January 6\n\nVirginia \u201cGinni\u201d Thomas, a conservative activist and the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, told the committee that when she said she was \u201cdisgusted\u201d with then-Vice President Mike Pence in a text on January 10, 2021, she wasn\u2019t referring to his refusal to stop the congressional certification of Joe Biden\u2019s win, but rather to her frustration with him not talking up election fraud claims. There was no evidence of widespread election fraud in the election.\n\n\u201cI was frustrated that I thought Vice President Pence might concede earlier than what President Trump was inclined to do,\u201d Thomas said, according to a transcript released Friday. \u201cAnd I wanted to hear Vice President Pence talk more about the fraud and irregularities in certain states that I thought was still lingering.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t focused on the Vice President\u2019s role on January 6th,\u201d she said, when asked specifically if the text \u2013 previously reported by CNN \u2013 was connected to how he handled that day.\n\nAt another point in the interview, committee member Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, asked Thomas what specific episodes of fraud concerned her.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say that I was familiar at that time with any specific evidence,\u201d she said, pointing instead to what she heard from \u201cfriends on the ground\u201d and \u201cgrassroots activists\u201d who had \u201cfound things suspicious\u201d at polling places.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know specific instances,\u201d she said. \u201cBut certainly I think we all know that there are people questioning what happened in 2020, and it takes time to develop an understanding of the facts.\u201d\n\nThe committee had only limited questions about Thomas\u2019 interactions with her husband and his role on the Supreme Court \u2013 an area she would likely be able to decline to answer questions about, given the confidentiality allowed for married couples.\n\nHer husband had no idea she was texting Meadows, Thomas told the investigators.\n\n\u201cHe first learned of my text messaging with Mark Meadows in March when he was in the hospital and this committee released them,\u201d she said in her interview.\n\nThomas said she regretted text messages sent to Mark Meadows after 2020 election\n\nGinni Thomas told the House select committee she regretted the text messages she was sending to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows after the election.\n\n\u201cI regret the tone and content of these texts \u2026 I really find my language imprudent and my choices of sending the context of these emails unfortunate,\u201d Thomas said.\n\nThomas\u2019 mea culpa to the committee, captured in a transcript of her September interview that was released publicly Friday, marks a rare moment of public reflection from one of the more intriguing avenues the House panel pursued, after obtaining Meadows\u2019 texts. Thomas, a longtime conservative activist, had been sending Meadows messages about challenging the election results. She explained to the committee at her interview she was concerned about a concession of the election before accusations of fraud were fully explored.\n\n\u201cIt was an emotional time. I was probably just emoting,\u201d she said, in response to direct questions from committee member Adam Schiff, a California Democrat. \u201cSome of these are just things I was showing were moving through the movement and I\u2019m regretting that they became public \u2026 Certainly I didn\u2019t want my emotional texts to a friend released and made available.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for Thomas said in a statement Friday that her \u201cpost-election activities\u201d after Trump lost in 2020 were \u201cminimal and mainstream.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer minimal activity was focused on ensuring that reports of fraud and irregularities were investigated,\u201d attorney Mark Paoletta said in the statement. \u201cBeyond that, she played no role in any events following the 2020 election. She also condemned the violence on January 6.\u201d\n\nKey witness Tony Ornato tells committee he didn\u2019t recall details, citing \u2018fog of war\u2019\n\nOne of the key witnesses in the House committee\u2019s investigation, former White House deputy chief of staff Tony Ornato, told the panel he couldn\u2019t recall details from January 6, amid what he called \u201cthe fog of war\u201d during the US Capitol attack.\n\nOrnato has been a central figure in the investigation since former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson testified that he relayed to her how the then-president angrily tried to redirect his motorcade to the Capitol that day \u2013 another detail that Ornato told the committee he didn\u2019t recall.\n\nOrnato told the committee that most of his job on January 6 involved relaying information he received to then-chief of staff Meadows and said he couldn\u2019t recall specific details when asked about who was trying to encourage Trump to send out a statement that day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you, it was a very chaotic time in trying to get the information, and it was usually late information or it wasn\u2019t accurate or it was the fog of war and it was misrepresented. And it was very \u2013 a very chaotic day, so I don\u2019t recall those specific details,\u201d Ornato said.\n\nDuring a public hearing in June, Hutchinson testified that Ornato told her Trump was angry he couldn\u2019t go to the Capitol on January 6 after his speech at the Ellipse and that, during the ride back to the White House, he reached toward the front of the car to grab at the steering wheel.\n\nAccording to Ornato\u2019s November testimony to the committee, which was released Friday, Ornato did not recall the conversation with Hutchinson and said he was \u201cshocked\u201d by her testimony.\n\n\u201cI was called to put it on,\u201d Ornato told the committee, referring to Hutchinson\u2019s televised testimony, \u201cand I was shocked and surprised of her testimony and called Mr. Engel and asked him, \u2018What is she talking about?\u2019\u201d\n\nOrnato said that Robert Engel, the lead Secret Service agent in Trump\u2019s motorcade on the day of the US Capitol attack, didn\u2019t know what Hutchinson was referring to. Hutchinson testified that Ornato relayed the story about Trump\u2019s outburst to her back at the White House, while Engel was in the room.\n\nThe committee makes clear in its final report it did not find Ornato\u2019s testimony credible.\n\nTrump attorney questioned statistics on supposed dead voters in 2020 election\n\nAn attorney on Trump\u2019s post-election legal team questioned some of the statistics being used to support claims of mass fraud, pointing out that many supposedly dead voters in Georgia likely sent in their ballots before they died, according to a January 6 committee transcript released Friday.\n\nThe committee read an email from the attorney, Katherine Friess, to Giuliani during the panel\u2019s interview with him. In the email, Friess weighed in on a chart being prepared for Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican.\n\n\u201cMany of the dead voters on the Georgia list sent their vote in before they passed. I don\u2019t think this makes a particularly strong case, and I think it\u2019s possible that Chairman Graham will push back on that,\u201d Friess said in the email, according to the committee investigators who were questioning Giuliani.\n\nCNN previously reported that another Trump lawyer, Christina Bobb, told the committee that Graham promised to \u201cchampion\u201d Trump\u2019s election fraud claims, saying: \u201cJust give me five dead voters.\u201d And Georgia election officials told Trump they found two votes cast in the names of dead people, not 5,000 as the former president suggested.\n\nFriess said in her email that she was raising the issue so that everyone is aware of \u201cwhat the data actually says.\u201d Hundreds of names on the list were of people who had died after their ballot was received, according to the committee\u2019s description of the chart.\n\nAn attorney who represented Friess in litigation she brought to block a committee subpoena of her phone records did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s inquiry about her email.\n\nTrump White House liaison denies she was banned from Justice Department\n\nA Trump administration official who was accused of trying to access sensitive Justice Department election-related information denied in testimony to the committee that she was barred from entering the DOJ\u2019s building, as was reported at the time.\n\nHeidi Stirrup, who was working as the White House liaison to the DOJ during the 2020 election, said that her badge to enter in the building was deactivated briefly in November 2020, but that after a day or two it was reactivated and she was able to reenter the building.\n\nIn her deposition with the committee, Stirrup recounted conversations she had with then-Attorney General Bill Barr and another DOJ official when she was seeking information about what the department was doing to investigate voter fraud allegations after the 2020 election. She told congressional investigators that she \u201ctook it upon\u201d herself to talk to the DOJ officials about how the department was approaching the allegations, after being asked by \u201cfriends\u201d not in the federal government what was going on.\n\nStirrup told the committee that Will Levi, the other DOJ official she spoke to, shared with her a memo Barr sent to the department outlining the authority that US attorneys had to investigate allegations presented to them in their state. According to the transcript, Stirrup emailed that memo to various other Trump administration officials \u2013 including John Zadrozny and John McEntee, who both worked in the White House. She told the committee that she couldn\u2019t recall having conversations with any of those individuals about DOJ\u2019s investigations into the allegations, and said she shared with them the memo because she thought they would be interested in it.\n\nFormer Trump campaign aide said he hadn\u2019t intended to be on \u2018team crazy\u2019\n\nRobert Sinners, who worked on the Trump campaign\u2019s Election Day operations in Georgia in 2020 and helped organize the slate of alternate GOP electors there, told congressional investigators that his \u201cintent was never to be aligned with team crazy.\u201d\n\nSinners said he was assured that lawyers had signed off on the alternate elector plan and didn\u2019t realize that numerous lawyers working with the Trump campaign had soured on the electors idea by the time the fake electors were convening on December 14, 2020, according to a transcript released Friday night.\n\nIn hindsight \u2013 after more fully understanding the extent of the schemes to overturn the 2020 election and the reservations some Trump attorneys had about these plots \u2013 Sinners told investigators he was both \u201cashamed\u201d to have helped organize the fake electors and \u201cangry.\u201d\n\nCNN previously reported that Sinners emailed the fake electors asking for \u201ccomplete secrecy and discretion\u201d on December 13, 2020, a day before the GOP electors convened at the Georgia capitol. Sinners told the panel that efforts to ensure Georgia\u2019s GOP electors met in secrecy had more to do with skirting Covid-19 restrictions and avoiding protesters than keeping the elector plan under wraps.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details Friday.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe official start to hurricane season is just a week away and forecasters are predicting another busy one.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Climate Prediction Center on Tuesday forecast 14 to 21 named storms, six to 10 hurricanes and three to six major hurricanes \u2013 of Category 3 strength or greater.\n\nThe 2020 and 2021 seasons both exhausted the hurricane name list and broke records. No one can say for sure if this year will be similar, but in early April, Colorado State University released its numbers, which were right in line with what NOAA is forecasting.\n\nThe CSU forecast called for 19 named storms, nine hurricanes and four major storms.\n\nAfter back-to-back years of using all the hurricane names and resorting to the Greek alphabet, the World Meteorological Organization decided to do away with using the Greek alphabet and made another list of names to be used if all the hurricane names are exhausted once again.\n\nOf course it\u2019s impossible to know how many of those storms will make landfall along the US coast, or where the largest storms will develop.\n\nHowever, during the announcement, NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad recognized that the current hurricane cycle for the Atlantic is a busy one.\n\n\u201cIf you go back two years, the 2020 hurricane season broke records across the board and it\u2019s the most active season on record with 30 named storms,\u201d said Spinrad.\n\n\u201cThe 2021 hurricane season, which is the third most active year on record in terms of names of storms brought us 21 named storms with impacts, ranging from the Appalachian Mountains all the way to New England, resulting in over $78.5 billion in US damage.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s driving the above-average seasons\n\nThere are several contributing factors that play into a \u201cbusy\u201d hurricane season. \u201cWe are in an active period,\u201d said Spinrad. \u201cThere are certain ingredients that drive the intensity and the frequency of hurricanes.\u201d\n\nOne is the existing La Ni\u00f1a conditions in the equatorial Pacific. This phenomenon creates cooler-than-average ocean temperatures around the equator in the Pacific and results in weather impacts around the globe.\n\nLa Ni\u00f1a presents favorable conditions for hurricanes \u2013 in contrast to that of El Ni\u00f1o.\n\nHurricane seasons under El Ni\u00f1o conditions are known for upper-level wind patterns across the Caribbean that tear hurricanes apart as they try to form, making the seasons less active.\n\nAnother reason for the above-normal forecast is the location of what\u2019s called the \u201cGulf Loop Current.\u201d This current is \u201ca 600-foot-deep river of hot Caribbean water that travels between Cancun, Mexico and western Cuba into the Gulf,\u201d said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers.\n\nThis loop current is flowing farther north now, forcing warm water at deeper levels of the ocean to travel closer to the coastal areas along the Gulf of Mexico. \u201cThe warm water is simply too deep and the hurricane has an unlimited supply of hot water for intensification,\u201d said Myers.\n\nForecasters are comparing the position of the loop current with where it was placed in the record-breaking 2005 season \u2013 when Hurricanes Katrina and Rita both made landfall.\n\n\u201cYes, the loop current does look like 2005,\u201d said Matthew Rosencrans, lead hurricane season outlook forecaster with NOAA\u2019s Climate Prediction Center. \u201cBut it depends if a storm actually moves over that loop current and forecasting the specific track of storms is not something we can do beyond a week time frame,\u201d Rosencrans added.\n\nBack-to-back record-breaking years\n\nDuring the 2021 hurricane season, eight storms made landfall along the US Gulf Coast and in 2020 six made landfall along the Gulf.\n\nIn 2020, Hurricanes Laura and Delta both slammed into southwest Louisiana, making landfall roughly 15 miles apart.\n\nWhat to do if you are in the path of a hurricane\n\n\u201cIn 2021, Hurricane Ida ripped through Southeast Louisiana, then caused more catastrophic damage in the Northeast.\n\n\u201cHurricane Ida spanned nine states, demonstrating that anyone can be in the direct path of a hurricane and in danger from the remnants of a storm system,\u201d said FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell. \u201cIt\u2019s important for everyone to understand their risk.\u201d", "label": "human"}
{"text": "watch now\n\nFTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was sent back to a Bahamas jail Monday in a chaotic courtroom scene, after a reported plan for him to waive his extradition to the U.S. stalled. However, multiple media reports later in the day said that he had told his Bahamian lawyer to proceed with extradition hearings, and he's now expected back in court later this week. Reports over the weekend indicated that Bankman-Fried would consent to extradition, but the former crypto billionaire told a different story Monday, demanding to see a copy of his federal indictment before agreeing to return to the U.S. He will return to Fox Hill jail rather than surrendering himself to U.S. custody. Bankman-Fried's legal team signaled that they would fight extradition last week. CNBC and several other outlets reported that Bankman-Fried had changed his mind and would instead submit himself for extradition on Monday.\n\nFTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (C) is led away handcuffed by officers of the Royal Bahamas Police Force at the Nassau, Bahamas, courthouse on December 19, 2022. Kris Ingraham | Afp | Getty Images\n\nIn open court, chaos reigned. Bankman-Fried, 30, dressed in a blue suit and white button-down shirt, was visibly shaking. His Bahamian defense attorney., Jerone Roberts, told the court that he was \"shocked\" that Bankman-Fried was in court. \"I did not request him to be here this morning,\" the attorney said. Franklyn Williams KC, the Bahamian prosecutor, said that he \"understood that [Bankman-Fried] intended to waive extradition,\" according to an NBC News producer present in the courtroom. The FTX founder arrived at Bahamian court in a convoy of police vehicles, heavily guarded, just after 10 a.m. ET.\n\nwatch now\n\nAfter the hearing closed, the New York Times and Washington Post both reported that Bankman-Fried agreed to extradition, citing Roberts. \"We as counsel will prepare the necessary documents to trigger the court,\" Mr. Roberts told the Times. CNBC has not yet been able to confirm these reports independently. The move comes just days after he was remanded to the medical unit of Bahamas' notorious Fox Hill Prison. The State Department in a 2020 report called the conditions at Fox Hill Prison \"harsh,\" citing \"overcrowding, poor nutrition, inadequate sanitation, poor ventilation, and inadequate medical care.\"\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, founder of FTX, is escorted inside of the Magistrate's Court in Nassau, Bahamas, on Monday, Dec. 19, 2022. Victor J. Blue | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nMedical care in particular is spotty at the Bahamian prison, the report said. The former billionaire was transported from one of his several multimillion-dollar penthouse homes to the prison last week \u2014 though Bankman-Fried was entitled to his own room in the medical wing, Bloomberg reported. Bankman-Fried faces life in federal prison, without the possibility of supervised release, if convicted on just one of eight offenses that prosecutors have charged him with. His sentence could be reduced by mitigating factors. Trial lawyers and former prosecutors say that, in practice, many white-collar defendants are given lesser sentences than what the guidelines dictate. So, even in large fraud cases, you can see life sentences drastically reduced. WATCH: Why Sam Bankman-Fried may decide to drop his fight against being extradited to the U.S.", "label": "human"}

The roommates told police that they were all asleep, or at least in their rooms, by 4 am. local time, except for Kernodle, who received a DoorDash order around that time, the affidavit said.\n\nOne of the roommates told police she was asleep in her second-floor bedroom before 4 am. and woke up to the sound of what she assumed was Goncalves playing with her dog in her third-floor bedroom.\n\nThe roommate said she thought she heard Goncalves say \"there's someone here,\" but was unsure as phone records obtained by police show that Kernodle was on TikTok at 4:12 am, and the roommate could have heard noises from her phone, the affidavit said.At that point, the roommate opened her bedroom door to look outside but did not see anything, the affidavit said.\n\nShe told police that she opened her door and looked outside a second time when she heard crying coming from Kernodle's room. She told police she also heard a male voice say, \"It's ok, I'm going to help you.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nA nearby security camera picked up the sounds of crying, a dog barking, and a \"loud thud\" at 4:17 am, the affidavit said.\n\nThe roommate then opened her bedroom door a third time and saw \"a figure clad in black clothing and a mask that covered the person's mouth and nose walking towards her,\" according to the affidavit.\n\nShe said the man walked past her as she stood in a \"frozen shock phase.\" The roommate locked herself in her bedroom as the man walked toward the back sliding glass door.\n\nShe told police she did not recognize the man.\n\nPolice identified 28-year-old Bryan Kohberger, a Ph.D. student at Washington State University who lived about 10 minutes away from the crime scene, as a suspect in connection to the case.\n\nThe suspect was detained in his hometown of Albrightsville, Pennsylvania, on December 30 after he and his father drove cross-country from Washington state. Police connected the suspect's DNA to the case by searching his parents' trash can at their Albrightsville family home.\n\nHe was extradited to Idaho where he appeared in court Thursday and now faces four first-degree murder charges and one count of felony burglary in connection to the case.\n\nRead the original article on Insider", "label": "human"}

{"text": "La mejor forma de superar la cuesta de enero es consiguiendo que ning\u00fan otro enero se haga tan empinada. \u00bfC\u00f3mo? Con una buena planificaci\u00f3n, un presupuesto y un h\u00e1bito de ahorro.\n\nSiempre podr\u00e1s encontrarte con eventos econ\u00f3micos externos que tensen m\u00e1s o menos tu situaci\u00f3n financiera, como la inflaci\u00f3n. Sin embargo, incluso la inflaci\u00f3n se puede combatir con una buena planificaci\u00f3n. Y no necesitas un asesor financiero para hacerlo, t\u00fa mismo puedes construirlo desde cero.\n\nSi las finanzas personales siguen siendo tu asignatura pendiente, estos 7 trucos te ayudar\u00e1n a empezar el a\u00f1o con buen pie y un s\u00f3lido prop\u00f3sito de a\u00f1o nuevo.\n\n1. Incluye el gasto de la cuesta de enero en tu presupuesto\n\nAsume que vas a tener que superar los m\u00e1s de 600 euros que te has dejado en las navidades (y los d\u00edas que quedan). Incluye esta partida en tu presupuesto personal para no arrastrarla el resto del a\u00f1o y empieza a ahorrar para cuando lleguen las Navidades de 2024.\n\nSi no sabes qu\u00e9 es un presupuesto personal, aqu\u00ed tienes toda la informaci\u00f3n que necesitas, una plantilla de hoja de c\u00e1lculo y una gu\u00eda para empezar a ahorrar para cumplir el mejor prop\u00f3sito financiero que puedas ponerte este a\u00f1o.\n\n2. C\u00e9ntrate en recortar gastos\n\nSi no puedes aumentar tus ingresos en enero, tu estrategia se tiene que centrar en recortar gastos. Tambi\u00e9n puedes buscar formas de rentabilizar el dinero que tienes ahorrado, pero antes necesitar\u00e1s un colch\u00f3n de emergencia para hacer frente a un a\u00f1o con signos de recesi\u00f3n.\n\nEntre tanto, recorta todos los gastos innecesarios y reduce aquellos que m\u00e1s pesan en tu registro de gastos. Las compras de primeras marcas en el supermercado, la gasolina, los caprichos y vicios...\n\n3. Evita las aberraciones que te hacen gastar m\u00e1s dinero en el supermercado\n\nAunque el nuevo decreto anticrisis incluye un IVA del 0% para alimentos de primera necesidad, a\u00fan no es un buen momento para ir al supermercado sin una lista de la compra, con hambre y sin tiempo.\n\nEsas son las t\u00edpicas aberraciones que siempre te hacen gastar m\u00e1s en el supermercado y que son m\u00e1s dif\u00edciles de rectificar porque se han convertido en un mal h\u00e1bito.\n\n4. Si no has ahorrado para las rebajas, abstente de cualquier compra innecesaria\n\nLas rebajas son todos los a\u00f1os en las mismas fechas. Por lo que si eres de las personas que aprovecha este momento para renovar el armario de verano y de invierno, las rebajas tienen que formar parte de tu presupuesto.\n\nEvita tambi\u00e9n cualquier tentaci\u00f3n de comprarte algo que realmente no necesitas, como el vestido del evento del a\u00f1o. Si el descuento no es suculento, no tienes excusa.\n\n5. Redondea tus compras para ahorrar un poco m\u00e1s cada mes\n\nSi lo que m\u00e1s te cuesta no es dejar de comprar si no ahorrar una cantidad determinada cada mes, empieza a ponerle trampas a tu cerebro para ahorrar sin darte cuenta y valorar a medio largo plazo los beneficios que tiene separar dinero cada mes para el futuro.\n\nUno de los trucos m\u00e1s conocidos para ahorrar sin hacer grandes sacrificios es el redondeo de tus compras. No se trata de que te hagan un reembolso por un pago con tu tarjeta, como el cashback, sino de que redondear el precio al euro para meter la diferencia en un monedero digital.\n\nPor ejemplo, si pagas 1,70 euros por un caf\u00e9, enviar\u00e1s a tu monedero 0,30 c\u00e9ntimos.\n\n6. Aprovecha el A\u00f1o Nuevo para encontrar facturas m\u00e1s baratas\n\nNunca ha sido cierto eso de \"A\u00f1o Nuevo, vida nueva\", pero s\u00ed que uno tiene la sensaci\u00f3n de que algo comienza. Gusta limpiar la casa, tirar cosas viejas y pensar los prop\u00f3sitos que har\u00e1n del a\u00f1o que entra un a\u00f1o mejor que el anterior.\n\nMuchas de estas cosas se quedan ah\u00ed, a la v\u00edspera o en la primera semana del a\u00f1o nuevo. Pero otras pueden cambiar realmente tu realidad para los pr\u00f3ximos 365 d\u00edas. Como hacer una limpieza de armario y conseguir ingresos extra vendiendo la ropa de segunda mano o rebajar las facturas del hogar.\n\n7. Convierte el ahorro en un h\u00e1bito para no volver a pasar por lo mismo el a\u00f1o que viene\n\nEste podr\u00eda ser el a\u00f1o que marque un antes y un despu\u00e9s en tus finanzas incluso con una posible recesi\u00f3n a la vuelta de la esquina. Programa tu primera transferencia autom\u00e1tica para beneficiarte del truco del preahorro o recurre al ahorro progresivo si a\u00fan te cuesta guardar dinero para el futuro.\n\nOtra forma de asegurarte que no volver\u00e1s a tener una cuesta de enero imposible es registrando todos tus gastos e ingresos para tener un presupuesto personal realista en 2024.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The Experiences of an American Model Married to a Nigerian Prince\n\nAs a 26-year-old American model, I, Jaydin Smith, have had a unique experience of interracial marriage. My husband, His Royal Highness Oladipo Omehe, is a second-generation Nigerian prince, and our union has been met with severe discrimination. Our story serves as a reminder that racism is still prevalent in the UK, despite centuries of social and economic reforms.\n\nGrowing up in a small town in California, I was relatively sheltered from the problems of the world until I moved to the UK. My husband and I had been dating for a few years when he revealed his royal lineage. Although I was initially excited and apprehensive, I soon realized that his heritage would lead to discrimination against us.\n\nWe decided to move to London to escape potential prejudice in the US, but our experience in the UK soon proved that racism still runs deep. We faced culture shock, with locals staring at us and whispering derogatory comments. The lack of response to job applications and occasional racist comments from strangers only added to our frustration.\n\nWe also experienced discrimination in the workplace and had several unpleasant experiences with landlords who refused to rent us an apartment due to our interracial marriage. The situation was no different for Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, who had already been targets of racism and hate when their relationship was first announced.\n\nDespite the discrimination, Oladipo and I are still together and happier than ever. We've accepted the fact that racism is still present in society and have become more resilient to its effects. We're grateful for our incredible support system in the UK, with friends and family who have embraced us and are supportive of our marriage.\n\nMy story is a reminder that, despite centuries of social and economic reforms, racism still runs deep in the UK. Interracial couples, like Meghan and Prince Harry, still face discrimination and bigotry, even in a country that prides itself on tolerance. While the situation is far from perfect, I am proud of my marriage and the strength it takes for interracial couples to overcome the obstacles that stand in their way.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Luister hieronder naar de audioversie van dit artikel\n\n15 15 0:00 4:13\n\nInspanningsfysioloog Tom Holland moedigt iedereen aan om te gaan hardlopen als het buiten koud is.\n\nHardlopen in de winter helpt om je immuunsysteem te verbeteren tijdens de donkere maanden.\n\nHolland stelt dat de kou je lichaam minder belast vergeleken met hardlopen als het warm is.\n\nLees ook: Fit worden zonder uren in de sportschool door te brengen? Zo haal je het maximale uit korte workouts\n\nTerwijl de meeste gelegenheidslopers ervoor kiezen om binnen te blijven als het kouder wordt, is de winter volgens inspanningsfysioloog Tom Holland eigenlijk een van de beste tijden om te gaan hardlopen.\n\nHij beweert dat hardlopen in de kou niet alleen grote voordelen heeft, maar ook veel minder stressvol voor je lichaam is dan wanneer het buiten warm is.\n\nHolland vertelt Insider dat hardlopen in de kou je humeur kan verbeteren en zelfs je immuunsysteem versterkt tegen winterkwalen.\n\nHardlopen in winter: draag een nauwsluitende eerste laag, muts en handschoenen\n\nHolland, die de podcast Fitness Disrupted presenteert, zegt dat er een paar dingen zijn om te overwegen als je gaat hardlopen in de winter. Ten eerste wil je lichaamsdelen zoals je handen en oren warm houden.\n\n\"Als je naar een marathon kijkt op een koude dag, hebben de toplopers hempjes en korte broeken aan. Maar ook mutsen en handschoenen\", zegt hij.\n\nIn de kou geeft het lichaam prioriteit aan het opwarmen van de centrale delen van je lijf. Dit trekt bloed weg van de lichaamsdelen die het verst van je hart verwijderd zijn.\n\nJe wilt natuurlijk wel dat je ledematen warm blijven, maar hoe warm verschilt per persoon en hoe koud het buiten is. Hoewel je het niet ijskoud moet hebben als je naar buiten gaat, wil je het wel koud hebben. Je lichaam warmt namelijk snel op van het hardlopen.\n\nHolland adviseert een nauwsluitende eerste laag voor je bovenlichaam. Dit kan volgens hem zelfs als de temperatuur onder het vriespunt zakt, voldoende zijn. Daar overheen kun je een lossere laag doen voor je bovenlichaam als het echt koud is. Daar kan nog een windjack bij als het extremer weer is.\n\nEen tot twee lagen zijn meestal genoeg voor je onderlichaam, zegt hij.\n\nVoordeel 1: je levert waarschijnlijk betere prestaties\n\nEen van de beste redenen om in de kou te lopen is dat je waarschijnlijk sneller loopt en je beter voelt dan wanneer je in de hitte zou lopen, stelt Holland.\n\nTemperatuurregeling tijdens het hardlopen is stressvol voor ons lichaam, zegt hij. En dit wordt erger naarmate het warmer wordt, omdat je bloed zich dan verplaatst van het centrale deel naar je huid om zweet te produceren. Dit proces onttrekt bloed aan ons hart, terwijl we daar bij het hardlopen juist een extra beroep op doen.\n\nVolgens Holland is de temperatuurregeling van het lichaam bij kouder weer niet contraproductief, zoals bij warmer weer wel het geval is. Het lichaam stuurt bij lagere temperaturen namelijk juist bloed naar de kern en het hart. De optimale buitentemperatuur zou rond de 10 graden Celsius liggen, stelt de inspanningsfysioloog.\n\nEenduidig onderzoek over de hoeveelheid calorie\u00ebn die je verbrandt bij hardlopen in koud weer, is er niet. Maar Holland denkt dat je jezelf sowieso meer pusht als het kouder is, omdat je je dan beter voelt.\n\nVoordeel 2: hardlopen in de kou kan je humeur verbeteren\n\nHolland zegt dat hij mensen vooral aanraadt te gaan hardlopen in de kou, omdat ze zich er mentaal beter door zullen voelen. Lichaamsbeweging zoals hardlopen zorgt ervoor dat verschillende stemmingsverbeterende stoffen vrijkomen, zoals endorfine, dopamine en serotonine.\n\nDe koudere maanden zijn ook een tijd waarin we minder naar buiten willen, zegt Holland. Maar juist dan is het eigenlijk heel belangrijk dat we dat wel doen. Als de dagen korter worden, komen aandoeningen zoals seizoensgebonden depressies veel vaker voor.\n\nSporten in de natuur heeft volgens Holland een nog groter voordeel voor de geestelijke gezondheid dan binnen bewegen.\n\n\"Als je kijkt naar de uitkomsten van onderzoek naar bewegen in de natuur, zouden mensen het juist vaker willen doen nadat ze eenmaal buiten zijn geweest. Je bent geneigd er meer van te genieten en zult het daardoor vaker willen doen\", zegt hij.\n\nVoordeel 3: Bewegen in de kou kan goed zijn voor je immuunsysteem.\n\nElke vorm van fysieke activiteit is goed voor je gezondheid, zegt Holland. Uit onderzoek blijkt dat een gebrek aan beweging in de winter je vatbaarder kan maken voor ziekten.\n\nUit onderzoek komt ook naar voren dat blootstelling aan omstandigheden zoals kou kan helpen om beter om te gaan met stress in het algemeen.\n\nHolland zegt dat het belangrijk is om je lichaam uit te dagen om gezond te blijven. Vooral op dagen dat je eigenlijk binnen wilt blijven en minder beweegt.", "label": "human"}

The high-rise, built in the mid-2000s, was meant to be a beacon of modernity and progress, but its unsafe cladding, soaring living costs, and uncertain future have turned it into a nightmare.\n\nResidents like Ella Johnston, who moved in 2018, were sold a dream but are now trapped in a building that is a risk to their safety. The tower's cladding was found to be non-compliant with fire safety regulations, leading to evacuation notices from the Manchester City Council. However, with rents elsewhere in the city at an all-time high, many residents were forced to stay and wait for help that never came.\n\nElla and her neighbors were left with no choice but to take out loans or use their savings to pay the rent and bills. The situation has become a daily struggle, with residents feeling forgotten and alone. The government's failure to act has only added to their frustration and despair.\n\nIn 2021, the government finally announced an independent inquiry into the cladding scandal, which has given residents a chance to speak out about their experiences.

A strike, believed to have been carried out by US-backed forces, resulted in the death of at least three Russian troops and the injury of three others.

The Russian military has stated that they are \"deeply concerned\" about the incident and will take measures to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.

According to the ICI, retail investors put $5.5 billion into stock mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) during October, up from the $3.7 billion that had been invested in September.\n\nWith the uncertainty created by the pandemic, it's no surprise that more investors have been opting for passive strategies, such as ETFs and index funds, which allow them to diversify their portfolios without having to manage individual stocks. This strategy also helps to reduce portfolio volatility.\n\nAt the same time, retail investors have also been taking advantage of recent market conditions and, according to the ICI, actively managed funds have seen inflows for the fourth straight month in October. This shift in retail investor sentiment from passive to active is largely driven by the improved market conditions and the prospect of higher returns.\n\nSo what should investors be aware of in the upcoming year?\n\nFirst, it's important to remember that the stock market is inherently unpredictable, and investors should be prepared for unexpected outcomes. That being said, there are still some attractive opportunities for investors to take advantage of.\n\nOne of the most popular areas of focus for investors in the coming year is technology stocks, with many retail investors taking advantage of the advancements in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and other technologies to invest in companies that have the potential to make a significant impact in the years to come.\n\nAnother area of focus that's likely to gain momentum in 2023 is the cannabis industry. With increasing regulations in the United States and Canada, investors are taking advantage of the growth potential in this sector. For those looking for an alternative to stocks, cannabis-focused ETFs can provide an easy way to diversify without taking on too much risk.\n\nIn addition, retail investors should be on the lookout for momentum stocks, as well as small-cap stocks that could potentially experience rapid growth in the near future.\n\nFinally, it's important for retail investors to take advantage of the low-interest-rate environment. With interest rates remaining near historical lows, it's a great time for investors to consider bonds, particularly those with high yields that offer more attractive returns than traditional investments.\n\nUltimately, retail investors should keep in mind that there's no one-size-fits-all approach to investing. It's important to diversify, be patient, and look for opportunities that match an investor's own risk tolerance and goals. By doing so, investors can create a portfolio that will weather any market conditions, while at the same time, taking advantage of potential returns.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "When a highly anticipated report on a significant event in American history is released, many individuals will be pondering whether they should engage with the content.\n\nThis is not an abstract inquiry: a coalition of publishing entities has already decided that the most effective method to prevent the report from being quickly forgotten is to have it widely read and discussed.\n\nThe publishing entities, which include Melville House, Haymarket Books, and Verso Books, are currently working on transforming the findings of the congressional report into a comprehensive, book-length version for widespread dissemination.\n\n\"It's been remarkable to see numerous individuals come together to disseminate this report,\" said Matt Weiland, editor-at-large of Melville House, which is spearheading the effort. \"We want individuals to comprehend what transpired and ensure that the truth is not lost to the annals of history.\"\n\nThe initiative occurs at a time when significant portions of the country still remain divided regarding the events of January 6, when a group of individuals stormed the United States Capitol in an attempt to disrupt the certification of President Joe Biden's victory. The incident resulted in the loss of five lives and numerous injuries.\n\nThe objective of the book-length report is to make the information accessible to a broader audience. This endeavor is being coordinated with major retailers to ensure the report is widely available.\n\n\"We desired it to be accessible to everyone,\" he said. \"We want to ensure that the information is out there and individuals can decide for themselves whether they wish to engage with it or not.\"\n\nThe book-length report will include an overview of the events of January 6, as well as profiles of individuals who participated in the violence. It will also include sections on the United States Capitol Police and their response to the riot, the federal government's efforts to investigate the incident, and the impact of the attack on future civil unrest.\n\nThough the publishing entities have not revealed which authors will be involved in the project, Weiland stated that the report will be written in a manner that is accessible to the general public. He hopes that, by making the report available in a more reader-friendly format, it will spark further dialogue and discussion on the events of January 6.\n\n\"We want this to lead to genuine discussion, not just a one-time read,\" he said. \"We want individuals to be able to return to the book and have further conversations about it.\"\n\nThe book is not expected to be a definitive account of what transpired on January 6, as the investigation is ongoing and may continue for several months. However, Weiland stated that the book will serve as a good starting point for individuals looking to comprehend the events of that day.\n\n\"This is something that needs to be discussed openly,\" Weiland said. \"If we can do that, then hopefully some good can come out of this terrible tragedy.\"\n\nThe book will be available starting December 17 and is expected to be widely distributed. The authors, publishers, and booksellers involved hope that as many individuals as possible read it and reflect on the events of January 6.\n\n\"This is an event that truly shook the nation,\" said Mitchell Cohen, executive director of Haymarket Books. \"We want to ensure that the events of January 6 never fade from the public consciousness and that individuals understand the significance of this moment in our history.\"", "label": "machine"}

The home button at the bottom of the screen is gone and has been replaced with a fingerprint reader in the power button. It has a more squared design, similar to the iPad Air and iPad Pro, with a large 10.9-inch screen, USB-C in place of the Lightning connector, and will ship in different colors like pink, yellow, blue and silver. Apple also announced a new $249 Magic Keyboard Folio case for the iPad that has a kickstand, a trackpad with support for multitouch and a magnetic connector that automatically charges it. But there's something strange about the Apple Pencil support. The new iPad doesn't work with the better second-generation Apple Pencil, which charges on the side of the iPad Air, iPad mini and iPad Pro. Since the new iPad uses USB-C instead of a Lightning port \u2014 which is used to charge the Apple Pencil on earlier models \u2014 you'll need to buy a $9 USB-C to Lightning adapter in order to charge the Apple Pencil. Apple will sell different configurations, including Wi-Fi only and WiFi + 5G cellular, but it starts at $449, which is a bump from the $329 starting price of the ninth-generation iPad. It's available to order Tuesday and will be in stores beginning Oct. 26.\n\nApple iPad Pro 2022\n\nApple's new iPad Pros in 11-inch and 12.9-inch sizes. Apple\n\nAs in recent years, the company will sell two sizes of the iPad Pros: an 11-inch model and a larger 12.9-inch model with a nicer screen. The big change to the iPad Pro is a new M2 processor, which is the same one that was introduced in the MacBook Air earlier this year. Apple said it's up to 15% faster than the M1 processor used in the last model of the iPad Pro that was introduced in 2021. The Apple Pencil works a bit differently on the new iPad Pros, too. The screen can now detect the tip of the Pencil up to 12 mm above the surface of the screen. Apple says this will allow artists to sketch with more precision and makes handwriting-to-text conversions faster. The 11-inch iPad Pro starts at $799 while the 12.9-inch model starts at $1,099.

{"text": "In the new Almost Famous musical, Penny Lane arrives in Scene III, when Cameron Crowe\u2019s stage direction says, \u201ca luminous girl emerges from the shadows.\u201d The play will spend the rest of the show chasing her\u2014and for the past three years, so has a team of makeup pros, hair artists, costume designers, and vintage clothing hunters. \u201cI\u2019ve been living on Etsy since 2019,\u201d says David Zinn, the Tony-nominated designer for the show. \u201cAnna Sui, Missoni. Those are the dream.\u201d\n\nBut Almost Famous has always been a dream, at least for the girls who grew up transfixed by its \u201cBand Aids\u201d and their careless heap of smeared, smoked-up glamour. Now 22 years after its film premiere, the story comes to Broadway, and while some music is different (think: Elton John and Led Zeppelin classics intertwined with original songs by Broadway veteran Tom Kitt), one key feeling from the film remains the same: When watching the show, you really want to pause the story and climb into it yourself. Since style is the closest thing humans get to teleports, the fashion and beauty looks in this show hit deep.\n\nBroadway\u2019s Penny Lane (Solea Pfeiffer), as imagined by Almost Famous costume designer David Zinn. David Zinn\n\nTo get them, Broadway Band Aids Solea Pfeiffer (Penny Lane), Katie Ladner (Sapphire), Jana Djenn\u00e9 Jackson (Polexia), and Julia Cassandra (Estrella) had daily fittings for their six to eight looks, which include pieces by Saloni, Camp Collection, and Alexis Bittar, plus one pair of epically embroidered bell bottoms. \u201cThere\u2019s a scene where I\u2019m smoking pot,\u201d says Ladner. \u201cSo, on my jeans, David embroidered a cockroach wearing a sweater and smoking a roach. It is the most incredible thing\u2014this bug smoking a blunt. The details in this show are astounding.\u201d They\u2019re also ever-changing, thanks to some character quirks approved by Crowe himself. \u201cWe\u2019re technically wearing something different every night,\u201d says Cassandra, \u201cBecause for every show, I\u2019ll match a scarf to the aura of the other Band Aids. Sometimes Katie is really pink, and sometimes Jana is really purple, you know?\u201d\n\nMore From ELLE\n\nThough the vibes\u2014and the purple auras\u2014are unchanged from the film, the cast is careful to point out that Broadway is a very different game, and they are therefore different players. \u201cOur director [Jeremy Herrin] made that very clear in the beginning,\u201d says Pfeiffer, who makes her Broadway debut in the role. \u201cHe said, \u2018This isn\u2019t an adaptation of the movie. This is another version of Cameron\u2019s story.\u201d And that was a relief, because obviously, I\u2019m not Kate Hudson. I mean, I\u2019m not white! I look nothing like her! I was given permission to really free myself and make Penny Lane my own.\u201d\n\nThe new Band Aids: Jana Djenn\u00e9 Jackson, Katie Ladner, and Julia Cassandra. David Zinn\n\nThat began with her makeup, which veered more into vintage showgirl than Hudson\u2019s babydoll rocker. \u201cI\u2019m a sucker for old-timey Broadway glamour,\u201d Pfeiffer says. \u201cTo me, Broadway is Barbra [Streisand] with the tips on her nails\u2014the long claws\u2014and the lashes, the gloss, the lustrous hair. I have loved Broadway culture and I have watched it and wanted to embody it my whole life. I wasn\u2019t gonna stop now! I mean, I finally got here!\u201d There are also practical reasons for Pfeiffer\u2019s piles of eyelashes and liquid liner. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a movie. There\u2019s no close-up here. I need people all the way in the back to see who Penny Lane is.\u201d\n\nBeauty artist Luc Verschueren created the hair and makeup for the show, and adds that Penny\u2019s inner light emerges through Charlotte Tilbury highlighter and Urban Decay\u2019s Almost Nude Foundation. \u201cPenny Lane makes out a lot,\u201d Pfeiffer laughs. \u201cPenny Lane hugs everyone. Penny Lane cries. And at first, I was like, \u2018How am I going to keep my makeup on through all of this?\u2019 But then I was like, \u2018You know, Penny Lane is living. There\u2019s gonna be a black mascara tear. There\u2019s gonna be lip gloss all over Russell Hammond after they kiss. He\u2019s a rock star; he can handle it. Let\u2019s lean into the heightened art form of theater, and of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing here, and it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s beautiful!\u2019\u201d (Faced with multiple quick changes, the other Band Aids use liberal mists of setting spray. \u201cIt really does the job,\u201d says Jackson. \u201cPolexia has these little freckles that I paint on every night to add some youth and innocence to her vibe. They\u2019re still there by the finale.\u201d)\n\nA scene from the San Diego production of Almost Famous. Neal Preston for Almost Famous Broadway\n\nTo get the Band Aid look at home, Verschueren suggests starting with the hair. \u201cIf you look at all the album covers, all the magazines, the hair is what tells you, \u2018I am rock \u2018n\u2019 roll,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThe easiest way to look like a Band Aid is to change your texture. You can use curlers\u2014just rag curls in your hair\u2014or, if you have a natural wave, you can try to bring it out. Think about Carole King\u2014lots of women have that wavy texture of hair, but she amplified it by dry-brushing it.\u201d For a slept-in curl, Sarah Potempa of recommends leaving the ends of your hair out of your iron or wand completely, which leads to a messier, sexier spiral.\n\nAs for makeup, Verschueren says that if you\u2019re actually going to a Stillwater show or a party at the Continental Riot House, think bronze. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of blue light at rock concerts and nightclubs,\u201d he says, \u201cWhich means there\u2019s also a lot of very blue light in our show. It\u2019s gorgeous, but for very fair people, like Katie [Ladner], the blue light makes the face go away, almost like a ghost. So I always try a warmer shade of powder, like a bronze. It might look a little strong in front of your own mirror, but when you\u2019re out, you will look like heaven.\u201d Ladner gets hers at Ulta, while Cassandra is a big fan of Fenty\u2019s brown and pink palettes.\n\nThe \u201cNo More Airplanes\u201d Tour. Almost Famous Broadway\n\nIn terms of the clothes, Zinn says it\u2019s mostly thrifted, with a few exceptions: Penny\u2019s iconic shearling coat (\u201cit\u2019s part magic carpet, part theatrical show curtain\u201d) was handmade especially for Pfeiffer in partnership with Curly Fur in Portland, Oregon. Sapphire wears a pair of star-stamped boots that were \u201ccustom-made to be as badass as possible.\u201d (Ditto for the crochet bikini worn by Penny at a pool scene in Arizona.) And some of Polexia\u2019s jewelry is the actress\u2019 own. \u201cI had my African waist beads on during my fitting,\u201d Jackson recalls. \u201cI thought they\u2019d tell me to take them off for the show, but they said, \u2018No, great, do you think Polexia would wear them?\u2019 And, hell yes, my Polexia would! I mean, this Polexia is a beautiful, Black young woman in 1973 hanging out with rock stars. Of course she does!\u201d\n\nAnd what about Penny\u2019s jeans\u2014surely they\u2019ve been rescued from a Goodwill in Troy, Michigan? \u201cThey\u2019re actually Free People,\u201d Pfeiffer laughs. \u201cI think all the Band Aid denim is, because it\u2019s got great stretch so we can move around on stage easily. And I love my jeans so much. I keep joking I\u2019m gonna steal them when I leave. But I can\u2019t, because that\u2019s not very Penny Lane, you know?

{"text": "As the situation in Chicago continues to unfold, local authorities are seeking assistance from the state government to alleviate the pressure of providing aid to the growing number of individuals seeking refuge. According to recent estimates, the cost of caring for and housing these individuals is rapidly approaching $100 million annually.\n\nChicago has been at the forefront of the nationwide crisis, with thousands of people seeking asylum. While some have been granted refugee status, many more are struggling to make ends meet in the city's overcrowded and often under-resourced shelters. As the number of migrants increases, the strain on Chicago's social services and resources has become increasingly evident.\n\nIn response, city officials are requesting an additional $50 million in state funding to cover the costs of shelter, food, and medical care for the rapidly growing migrant population. The majority of the funds would be allocated towards providing healthcare and housing for those seeking sanctuary in the city.\n\n\"This request is driven by the reality of the cost of providing shelter and basic care for migrants in our city,\" said Mayor Rahm Emanuel in a statement. \"We must do everything we can to ensure that those seeking asylum in Chicago receive the care and support they need and deserve.\"\n\nThe city's request comes on the heels of a recent report from the University of Chicago, which estimated that the city will need at least $173 million to provide adequate care for the migrant population in 2021. The report also noted that costs could exceed $200 million if the number of migrants continues to increase.\n\n\"It's not just the financial costs of caring for migrants that are a concern,\" said Alderman Joe Moore, who represents Chicago's 49th Ward. \"We need to ensure that the city provides the necessary resources and support to help these people transition and assimilate into the community. Without assistance, many of these people are likely to remain on the streets and in need of assistance for an extended period of time.\"\n\nThe city's plea for additional resources has been met with a mixed response from lawmakers in Springfield. While some, including Governor JB Pritzker, have expressed their support for the city's request, others have argued that additional funds should be allocated to other areas of the budget.\n\n\"We are facing a serious challenge and the state needs to step up and do its part,\" said Senate Majority Leader Kimberly Lightford, who supports the city's request. \"The state has a responsibility to provide resources to help the city care for these people and ensure that they are able to achieve the American Dream.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Chicagoans are taking action to assist the migrants in their own unique ways. Groups like the Chicago Migrant Solidarity Network and the Autonomous Tenant Union have organized housing and legal assistance for those seeking refuge, while grassroots activists are doing what they can to provide food and basic supplies to those in need.\n\nAt a time when our city's resources are stretched to their limit, it is more important than ever that we come together to support those in need.

{"text": "The semiconductor, or chip, industry is perhaps one of the most important and complex sectors in the stock market to understand. Chips are in everything from our smartphones to cars and to all facets of computing, from PCs to massive data centers used for the cloud. Put simply, they are the bricks and mortar of the digital world. We don't see them, but we know they magically make stuff work. Semiconductor companies are also in the news a lot lately, whether it's the U.S. government cracking down on chip exports to China or innovations in connected cars and artificial intelligence. But that doesn't make the industry any easier to understand, even for those familiar with the well-known players. Making things trickier: The market tends to bucket anything chip-related into broad-based investment vehicles, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds. These companies, however, are quite specialized. Despite the industry being out-of-favor right now \u2013 and our ongoing effort to scale back our once over-weighted chip holdings \u2013 we believe that investors' portfolios should have at least some exposure to the industry. For starters, they are crucial to nearly all secular growth trends today and into the future. And trying to time the booms and busts of the cycle is incredibly difficult if not impossible to do consistently. In our portfolio, we have small positions remaining in Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Nvidia (NVDA), Marvell Technology (MRVL) and Qualcomm (QCOM) \u2014 all of which design chips for varying uses. ( We'll get into the specifics later ). Here then is our guide to all things semiconductor. Our goal is to help you better understand where different chip-related companies sit in the supply chain, to differentiate these companies by their end markets, and to gain more insight on how money flows through the industry. After all, one company's capital expenditure is another company's revenue. What is a foundry model? The term foundry is industry jargon, referring to the factory where chips are made. There are four main categories in the supply chain under this model: Capital equipment makers, pure-play foundries or fabs, fabless designers, and integrated device makers. Capital equipment companies \u2014 such as Applied Materials (AMAT), Lam Research (LRCX), ASML Holdings (ASML) and KLA Corporation (KLAC) \u2014 make the machines used in the manufacturing of semiconductors. Pure-play foundries , or fabs, are companies with factories that fabricate (manufacture) chips designed by other firms (some designers have their own factories but we will touch on that below). In these monstrous facilities, you will find the capital equipment made by the capital equipment makers. That alone should provide some insight into the money flow, because when a foundry is being updated or built from scratch, a good deal of that spending is going to go into buying equipment from the capital equipment makers. When you hear commentary on a call from a foundry player about capital expenditure plans, just remember that what you're also hearing is commentary on demand and revenue for capital equipment makers. Players in the foundry space include companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), often referred to as just TSMC, and GlobalFoundries (GFS). Fabless designers generally outsource the chips they draw up to foundries. Again, we can start to see the flow of funds, as strong guidance from a fabless designer means high demand \u2014 and therefore, a need for a greater number of chips. Of course, the more chips a company needs, the greater the order value it will place with a foundry player such as TSMC. Fabless designers include our Club holdings Nvidia, AMD, Marvell Technology and Qualcomm. Since these companies don't need to invest in expensive fabrication facilities, they can run a more agile asset-light business model. They don't have to concern themselves with the need to lay out significant capital in order to ensure their ability to manufacture the most cutting-edge chips. Finally, integrated device companies design and manufacture their own chips in-house, essentially designers with their own foundries. Players in this group include Intel (INTC), Micron Technology (MU), ON Semiconductor (ON) and Texas Instruments (TXN). Semiconductor supply chain Understanding the structure of the semiconductor sector can help to better understand how money flows through the industry \u2014 and therefore, help members leverage earnings and corporate updates to make more informed decisions when investing in the industry. Here are some examples. If we know that capital equipment is used in foundries, what we really know from a financial perspective is that the capital expenditures (capex) made at the foundry level are directly tied to capital equipment maker revenue. So, when TSMC discusses capex on its conference call, it's our jobs as investors to read those comments through to demand for Applied Materials and Lam Research. When Nvidia discusses supply and demand dynamics, it provides insight into what it will need from a TSMC-type foundry or manufacturing facility. If there is an inventory glut, then the last thing Nvidia wants is more chips; that means fewer orders with TSMC and vice versa. Of course, in that same line of thinking, when cloud providers such as Club holdings Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) discuss investments, it means they need chips. These companies' capex is linked to revenue at fabless designers like Nvidia and AMD. We recently saw this dynamic at play when Meta Platforms (META) announced that 2023 capex spending would increase versus 2022 due to data center investments. The news tanked Meta stock due to what Wall Street believes to be undisciplined spending. However, it provided a boost to the semiconductor stocks that would realize Meta's spending as revenue. If you hear the economy is slowing and the cloud providers say they want to \"digest past investments,\" they are really saying that they spent a lot of money recently and are going to pump the breaks on additional investments in cloud capacity. In your head, you need to say, \"OK, cloud providers are slowing spending, which means less demand for Nvidia. If Nvidia is going to see less demand for the next few quarters then it may need to reduce orders from TSMC. And if TSMC is going to receive fewer orders, it may need cut capex \u2014 and as a result, demand for Lam Research's equipment may decline in the near-term.\" Of course, there are a lot of moving parts and timing the flow of funds is incredibly difficult. But that is how one needs to think at a high level. Remaining on the cutting edge requires always looking ahead, and companies must balance spending slowdowns with continued investment in the long term, which is why gauging the stages of the semiconductor investment cycle is so difficult. Nvidia may be seeing a glut of 30-series chips, but the company stills need to work on ramping production of its 40-series chips to be ready once the inventory glut is worked through. TSMC may not be seeing as much demand for 7-nanometer chips, but it needs to be in a position to start producing 5-nanometer and 3-nanometer chips after that. The company can't stop spending entirely. Without going into it too deeply, the smaller the chip size, the more densely packed the transistors. This results in more speed, less power consumption, and less heat, which would also mean less effort/power consumption/cost to control temperature levels. Types of semiconductor chips Just because two companies may be lumped together based on their places within the foundry business model does not mean they should be viewed as peers or even direct competitors. Despite both being fabless designers, Qualcomm, which focuses heavily on connectivity solutions, should not be likened to fellow fabless designer Nvidia, whose main focus is on graphics processing units (GPUs). Here is a high-level overview of the different kinds of chips that should help members better understand some of the terms thrown around when discussing this industry and a jumping-off point for those that want to research more on their own. Memory : The two main categories of memory chips are NAND and DRAM. Both markets are essentially oligopolies \u2014 meaning a few players control the supply. Samsung, Micron and SK Hynix pretty much own the DRAM market. In the NAND market, Samsung and Micron are also big players, in addition to Kioxia (formerly Toshiba), Western Digital (WDC), SK Hynix and Intel. NAND generally refers to a type of flash memory whereas DRAM stands for dynamic random access memory. As you can tell, this industry can get very technical, confusing, and frustrating very fast for those not familiar with the terms. Flash memory (again, think NAND) refers to a type of non-volatile storage medium. Non-volatile simply means that your data won't be lost once the power goes off. The most common use for flash memory that you may have seen the last time you purchased a personal computer is in solid-state drives (SSD), where all the files are stored on your computer. To really simplify things, when you hear NAND or flash memory, just think of the solid-state drive storage on a consumer PC. (Now you might be asking yourself what an SSD is. Basically, it's the storage device that is fast replacing traditional hard disk drives (HDDs) seen in older computers. Whereas HDDs have a spinning disc on which data is written, SSDs have no moving parts, making them faster and more secure \u2014 though you will pay up for that of course. DRAM is what's known as a volatile memory, meaning that it will retain data only so long as there is power. Oftentimes when you hear the term RAM or see memory listed on your PC specs, this is what is being referred to. Unlike flash, which stores data and files over long periods even when the power is off, DRAM is \"working memory\" that is called upon only when needed by a computer processor to perform a given function. The more intense the function, the more DRAM you might need, which is why a computer used for intense video editing or gaming will require more DRAM than one used to simply surf the web and check emails. Microprocessors : The three main processors to know are the central processing unit (CPU), the graphics processing unit (GPU), and the newer data processing unit (DPU). The CPU like those made by Intel and AMD, which essentially have a duopoly \u2014 two players control the supply \u2014 is basically the brains of a computer. It is responsible for retrieving instructions/inputs, decoding those instructions, and sending them along in order to have an operation carried out to deliver the desired result. As Nvidia put in a past blog post , if the CPU is the brain, then the GPU is the soul. GPUs are more specialized than CPUs and are good at taking on many tasks at once. Whereas a CPU will process data sequentially, a GPU will break down a complex problem into many small tasks and perform them at once. This is why we are seeing their prevalence grow in data centers. While the CPU remains essential, adding a GPU allows for an acceleration in data processing. With more data being transmitted, stored, and processed than ever before \u2014 as cloud computing is increasingly adopted and work on deep learning and artificial intelligence advances \u2014 speed is crucial. The GPU is essentially a duopoly owned by Nvidia and AMD. A DPU like those made by Marvell Technology and Nvidia is a newer type of processor that is becoming increasingly relevant as data centers become more complex. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a blog post , \"This is going to represent one of the three major pillars of computing going forward. The CPU is for general-purpose computing, the GPU is for accelerated computing, and the DPU, which moves data around the data center, does data processing.\" Everything else : To be sure, there are many different types of chips that fall outside of the memory or microprocessor classifications. Examples include those used for 5G, WiFi, Bluetooth, radiofrequency chips, near field communication chips (NFC), application-specific integrated circuit chips (ASICs), and so on. These chips are made by companies like Qualcomm, Marvell Technology, Broadcom (AVGO), ON Semiconductor, NXP Semiconductor (NXPI), and others. Rather than a deep dive into each one \u2014 something beyond the scope of this foundry industry analysis \u2014 we simply want to highlight that the term semiconductor applies to a broad array of chips designed for different purposes and exposed to different end markets that each have their own demand drivers. Bottom line When investing in the chip industry, it is crucial to understand a target company's exposure. You don't necessarily need an engineering level of understanding of how the chips work or are designed, but you do need to have an idea of what end market the company sells into and who the customers are. From there, you can begin to study the relevant end markets to better understand demand trends. Remember, at the end of the day, your primary question and the goal of your research is to understand where the money is flowing. That's true for all investments but especially so when it comes to semiconductors. Because they are literally everywhere but almost never seen, it's not as easy as saying, \"Apple is going to sell a lot of iPhones this quarter.\" Chances are nobody will be sitting around the Thanksgiving table talking about how excited they are for the next-generation memory and microprocessors to drop. However, when you do hear about that new gadget everyone can't wait to get their hands on, ask yourself, \"What semiconductors are sitting inside it?\" Despite being a boom/bust industry, sales do tend to increase over the years, and demand throughout the cycle increases thanks to the growing prevalence of semiconductors in our daily lives, with more chips jammed into each device in smaller and smaller form factors. The iPhone, for example, didn't always have light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology, but it does now to support new features and that means another chip packed in the handset. While we do see secular growth on longer timeframes, the industry still suffers from brutal boom and bust dynamics. Supply and demand drives all industries, but the semiconductor industry in particular is incredibly sensitive to it. Chipmakers have significant pricing power when demand outstrips supply, as we've seen in recent years; new cars will literally sit in the lot collecting dust as manufacturers wait for a key chip. But we see that pricing power turn on a dime once supply exceeds demand, leading to less pricing power and inventory gluts that must be addressed before the next cycle can kick off.

The minutes suggested Fed officials will base decisions on future rate hikes on data and the implications for inflation and growth. The committee will make decisions meeting by meeting, according to the minutes.\n\n\"Participants generally observed that a restrictive policy stance would need to be maintained until the incoming data provided confidence that inflation was on a sustained downward path to 2%, which was likely to take some time,\" the minutes said. \"In view of the persistent and unacceptably high level of inflation, several participants commented that historical experience cautioned against prematurely loosening monetary policy.\"\n\nOfficials viewed the job market as very strong, noting an unemployment rate near historically low levels, still strong payroll gains, a high level of job vacancies, and elevated nominal wage growth. Several participants commented that there were tentative signs of labor market imbalances improving, including declines in job openings and quits over the second half of 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nOfficials see a number of uncertainties surrounding the outlook for inflation stemming from factors abroad, such as China\u2019s relaxation of its zero-COVID policies, Russia\u2019s continued war with Ukraine, and effects of monetary policy from other major global central banks.\n\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences.

{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe term \u201chybrid\u201d is thrown around too loosely in entertainment, but it genuinely applies to \u201cPaul T. Goldman,\u201d a Peacock series from the director of the \u201cBorat\u201d sequel that combines fiction with sort-of reality, scripted with a behind-the-scenes \u201cmaking of\u201d docuseries. Quirky and odd, the show\u2019s main point feels like the fact we\u2019re all the heroes of our story, at least in our own highly subjective eyes.\n\nIt\u2019s honestly hard to know where to begin in describing the program, which, hilariously, makes note of the fact that after years of shooting and pitching the project, its first nibble was from Quibi. Of course, that \u201cquick bites\u201d streaming service quickly folded, allowing Peacock to step into the void. Critics also received five of the six episodes, and how the show ends, based on what precedes it, is a significant question mark.\n\nFor starters, \u201cPaul T. Goldman\u201d isn\u2019t the real name of the central character, who claims that he was fleeced by his second wife, a scam artist who married him for his money and professed to be tending to an elderly relative during her lengthy absences.\n\nGoldman (it gets confusing to call him anything else) became obsessed with unearthing details about the scheme, writing a book and film treatment about the experience. So Woliner shoots those scenes with Goldman as the awkward star of his own movie opposite real actors \u2013 including recognizable players like Dennis Haysbert, Frank Grillo, James Remar and Dee Wallace \u2013 then makes the viewer privy to all the off-screen shenanigans, as Goldman interacts with his confused but polite co-stars, who (understandably) don\u2019t seem to know what to make of him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a regular guy who got caught up in extraordinary circumstances,\u201d he contends during the direct-to-camera interviews, insisting that \u201cNobody could make up\u201d this story. Later, though, Goldman freely admits that parts of his screenplay version have been fabricated or embellished for dramatic effect, further blurring the lines.\n\nJust to complicate matters further, Woliner himself is a regular presence in the film \u2013 fielding his star\u2019s strange requests and suggestions that Goldman thinks will improve things \u2013 while weaving in photos, video and audio of actual characters, sometimes with their faces obscured.\n\nAs the episodes proceed, it becomes clear that Goldman has fudged details about much of what transpired, making it difficult to take what he says at face value.\n\nLike \u201cBorat,\u201d there\u2019s discomfort and comedy in this nexus of fiction and manipulated reality, and the extent to which Goldman appears oblivious to how he might look when all of this gets edited together. Is it cruel to indulge his delusions of grandeur? Given that he appears to be having the time of his life, it\u2019s hard to tell.\n\nProduced by Seth Rogen\u2019s company, \u201cPaul T. Goldman\u201d obviously comes during a boom time for true-crime docuseries, which frequently employ reenactments to heighten the drama. Woliner has essentially taken that practice to bizarre extremes, creating something that manages to feel fresh and occasionally quite funny, if a little cringe inducing at times.\n\nThe net result is a show that\u2019s as oddly watchable as it is hard to define. If only Quibi had lived to see it.\n\n\u201cPaul T. Goldman\u201d premieres January 1 on Peacock.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Fresh start, fresh prospects for aspiring homeowners and refinancers as the new year dawns, with mortgage and refinance rates holding steady, according to Freddie Mac's latest report.\n\nThe 30-year fixed-rate mortgage remains unchanged at 2.77 percent, while the 15-year fixed-rate mortgage also maintains its pace at 2.17 percent. Meanwhile, the 5-year Treasury-indexed hybrid adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) experiences a slight increase to 2.63 percent.\n\nThis favorable landscape is attributed to the Federal Reserve's continued support for the housing market through low interest rates. Low mortgage rates can make purchasing a home more accessible, and refinancing can lead to a lower monthly payment.\n\nHowever, experts caution that interest rates may rise in the coming weeks, making it essential for potential borrowers to act soon.\n\n\u201cRates remain extremely favorable, especially for fixed-rate loans, and I expect there will be an increase in demand for purchase and refinance loans in the coming weeks,\u201d said Sam Khater, Chief Economist at Freddie Mac.\n\nThis encouraging news follows a strong year for the housing market, with home sales rebounding significantly after a decline in April. The Case-Shiller Home Price Index, which tracks home prices across the U.S., rose 2.5 percent in November from a year ago.\n\nDespite this, potential home buyers should not rush into a decision. They should prioritize improving their credit score, budgeting, and saving for a down payment, as well as comparing rates and terms among multiple lenders to secure the best deal.\n\nFor those looking to refinance, it is crucial to do the math before signing to ensure it makes financial sense. Refinancing may reduce monthly payments and free up cash, but it will also increase the total interest paid over the loan's life.\n\nIf you're ready to take the leap, today's rates offer a great opportunity to lock in a low rate.

{"text": "It's crucial to acknowledge that the sooner you initiate saving and investing, the more prosperous your retirement will be. However, for those in their twenties, investing for retirement may seem daunting, overwhelming, and not a top priority.\n\nYet, it's pivotal to start investing and saving during your twenties \u2013 it's the ideal time to establish a retirement savings plan and lay the foundation for a robust financial future. Here are some compelling reasons to start thinking about investing and saving now:\n\n1. Amplify Your Earnings Potential\n\nBy commencing investments early, you're granting your funds more time to flourish. This is particularly true when it comes to investing in stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, which all have the potential for significant returns if given sufficient time.\n\nCompound interest is a vital tool for any retirement savings plan. Interest rates are typically low in the early years of your investment, but the longer you permit your money to grow, the more substantial your returns will be.\n\n2. Begin with Conservative, Cost-Effective Options\n\nWhen investing in your twenties, you don't need to make a significant commitment. Start with conservative, cost-effective options like index funds or ETFs. These investment vehicles enable you to own a portion of a much larger portfolio, providing a low-risk option with the potential for high returns.\n\n3. Leverage Tax Advantages\n\nInvesting in your twenties also presents the opportunity to take advantage of tax benefits. Contributions made to certain retirement accounts, such as IRAs or 401(k)s, are often tax deductible. This means that the money you contribute won't be subject to income taxes, allowing you to save even more for retirement.\n\n4. Cultivate Personal Growth\n\nInvesting in your twenties doesn't have to be limited to stocks, bonds, and other retirement savings plans. It's also essential to consider investing in yourself. This could include furthering your education, starting a business, or even investing in your career development.\n\nBy taking the time to invest in yourself, you'll be building the skills and knowledge necessary to further your career and increase your earning potential. Investing in yourself will yield a substantial return in the future.\n\n5. Gain Greater Control Over Your Finances\n\nInvesting in your twenties is also an excellent way to gain greater control over your finances. Investing will give you more freedom to choose where to allocate your funds, as opposed to relying on a financial institution or employer-sponsored retirement plan. This will grant you the autonomy to make investments that best align with your financial goals.\n\nThese are just a few of the compelling reasons why it's crucial to start investing and saving in your twenties. Investing early will provide you with the opportunity to begin building your retirement savings and take advantage of tax benefits. It's also the perfect time to invest in yourself to further your career and earning potential. Taking the time to invest and save in your twenties will yield significant dividends in the long run.", "label": "machine"}

It remains unclear whether he will accept or reject the offer. However, one certainty is that the tech world will be closely monitoring the situation to see what transpires next.\n\nThis incident is not the first time Miller has publicly criticized Musk. In the past, Miller has questioned Musk's business decisions and investments, including his recent criticism of The Boring Company, which Miller deemed a waste of resources.\n\nUltimately, it remains uncertain whether Miller's offer to acquire Twitter is genuine or simply an attention-grabbing stunt. Nevertheless, one thing is clear: the tech world will be closely following the developments.", "label": "machine"}

Corr\u00eda 1978 y era el parto de su segundo hijo, al que busca desde entonces.\n\n\u201cEl beb\u00e9 lloraba, se mov\u00eda, era vital ese beb\u00e9, no estaba muerto. Y alcanc\u00e9 a ver que era un var\u00f3n bien morochito, mi vida, y lloraba. Y yo siempre dec\u00eda \u00e9l lloraba porque sab\u00eda que nos iban a separar\u201d, relata entre llantos M\u00f3nica Ruz, quien hoy tiene 70 a\u00f1os y busca a su hijo desde 1971. A ella le dijeron que su hijo hab\u00eda fallecido luego del parto, pero a\u00f1os m\u00e1s tarde comprob\u00f3, por un testimonio familiar, que estaba vivo.\n\nLa Comisi\u00f3n Nacional por el Derecho a la Identidad (Conadi), creada en 1992 a instancias de Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo para la b\u00fasqueda de sus nietos sustra\u00eddos durante la \u00faltima dictadura militar (1976-1983), lanz\u00f3 la campa\u00f1a \u201cMam\u00e1s que buscan\u201d que ampl\u00eda su labor: ahora tambi\u00e9n convoca a quienes buscan a sus familiares y cuyos casos no est\u00e1n relacionados con ese r\u00e9gimen para ayudarlos a restituir su identidad.\n\n\u201cNosotros fuimos viendo que el robo y tr\u00e1fico de ni\u00f1os, la venta, el despojo, como se le quiera llamar, de los hijos de desaparecidos, como de los hijos de mujeres pobres, solas y menores de edad, transitaban carriles muy similares\u201d, explica Claudia Carlotto, directora ejecutiva de la Conadi. \u201cLogramos, por fin, un equipo, estructura, recursos y que se haga una campa\u00f1a como la que estamos llevando adelante ahora para convocar a la sociedad a que cualquier mam\u00e1 que haya sido alejada o separada de su hijo al nacer o al poco tiempo de vida, se pueda acercar a nosotros para acompa\u00f1arla y poner al servicio de estas realidades toda la experiencia de estos 30 a\u00f1os de trabajo por el derecho a la identidad de la Conadi\u201d.\n\npublicidad\n\nAs\u00ed comienzan a sistematizar una labor que hasta ahora muchas veces era el resultado de otras b\u00fasquedas: en el camino de encontrar a los nietos robados durante la dictadura, lograron restituir la identidad de m\u00e1s de 2.000 personas que no eran hijos de desaparecidos, seg\u00fan afirman.\n\nMam\u00e1s e hijos que buscan\n\nJudith Alexandre sent\u00eda que quien dec\u00eda ser su madre no era tal. Con el tiempo logr\u00f3 deducir que era adoptada y comenz\u00f3 a buscar sus verdaderos or\u00edgenes. \u201cEs una b\u00fasqueda muy larga que me acompa\u00f1\u00f3 toda la vida, porque desde muy chiquita sent\u00ed que algo hab\u00eda. Mi mam\u00e1 ten\u00eda 44 a\u00f1os cuando yo nac\u00ed y mi pap\u00e1 nueve m\u00e1s, 53. Hac\u00eda diez que estaban casados, estaban en lista de adopci\u00f3n legal, en lista de espera y pensaban que no les iban a dar un beb\u00e9 por la edad que ten\u00edan. Y de alguna forma alguien les hizo el contacto, les dijo \u2018ac\u00e1 ten\u00e9s la posibilidad de un beb\u00e9 reci\u00e9n nacido\u2019, tuvieron que poner plata, pero lo ten\u00e9s con papeles y todo y ya est\u00e1. Y as\u00ed fue que alguna vez me compraron y llegaron a m\u00ed\u201d.\n\nComo hab\u00eda nacido en 1977, Judith crey\u00f3 que podr\u00eda ser hija de desaparecidos. Por eso, en 1997 hab\u00eda dejado su sangre en el Banco Nacional de Datos Gen\u00e9ticos, que recopila la informaci\u00f3n de los familiares de desaparecidos.\n\nPero no tuvo resultados, su caso no ten\u00eda que ver con los secuestros de la dictadura. Y su mam\u00e1 biol\u00f3gica estaba viva. A\u00f1os m\u00e1s tarde supo que la buscaba.\n\n\u201cYa hac\u00eda m\u00e1s de 20 a\u00f1os\u2026 con lo cual mi expectativa de que ese llamado ocurra, so\u00f1ado, en la primera d\u00e9cada de \u2018te llamamos para decirte que encontramos\u2019 ya era muy remoto, era casi imposible. Ya hab\u00eda descartado esa expectativa\u201d, explica Judith, pero agrega, entre risas: \u201cY bueno, me llaman de la Conadi: Encontramos a tu mam\u00e1 y a tu hermana, me dice. As\u00ed como lo dijo, yo ya empec\u00e9 a no entender m\u00e1s nada del mundo\u201d.\n\nJudith, que para ese entonces ya ten\u00eda cuatro hijos, supo que no solo ten\u00eda una mam\u00e1, si no tambi\u00e9n dos hermanas. Todos se conocieron inmediatamente en las oficinas de la Conadi al d\u00eda siguiente de ese llamado.\n\n\u201cFue muy fuerte el abrazo de mam\u00e1 hacia m\u00ed. Me miraba y me acariciaba las manos, como miramos las mam\u00e1s a los reci\u00e9n nacidos. Eso fue muy, muy fuerte\u201d, recuerda emocionada mientras muestra fotos con su mam\u00e1 Adriana. El parecido f\u00edsico de ambas es notable y de car\u00e1cter, apunta Judith, tambi\u00e9n.\n\n\u201cCuando mi mam\u00e1 habl\u00f3 conmigo me dec\u00eda \u2018hija, vos preguntame todo lo que quieras saber\u2019, que eso era lo opuesto a lo que yo hab\u00eda vivido hasta ah\u00ed. Era \u2018no me preguntes\u2019, \u2018\u00bfqu\u00e9 te falta, que te hice?\u2019. Y desde ah\u00ed empieza otro cap\u00edtulo, mi vida se transforma. Mi mam\u00e1 de crianza hab\u00eda fallecido meses antes, en noviembre y en agosto nos reencontramos: yo no pas\u00e9 ning\u00fan D\u00eda de la Madre sin madre (N. de R: en Argentina se celebra en octubre). Es muy loco, muy fuerte y muy lindo porque siempre quise encontrarla\u201d\n\nLas madres, el eje de la campa\u00f1a\n\nLa campa\u00f1a de Conadi est\u00e1 enfocada principalmente en estas \u201cMam\u00e1s que buscan\u201d principalmente porque la desproporci\u00f3n es enorme: tienen m\u00e1s de 15.000 hijos buscando sus or\u00edgenes, pero solo 500 madres tratando de encontrarlos.\n\n\u201cEl patr\u00f3n es joven, pobre, sola. Sin contenci\u00f3n de ninguna naturaleza social, ni familiar ni econ\u00f3mica, que no pueda reclamar, que tenga miedo, que no tenga posibilidades de recurrir a un abogado\u201d, explica Carlotto. Adem\u00e1s, agrega, muchas veces hay sentimientos de culpa por haber dejado a sus hijos, aunque hayan sido forzadas a hacerlo.\n\n\u201cYo habr\u00e9 cometido el error de enamorarme y quedar embarazada, pero yo no quer\u00eda que me quitaran mi beb\u00e9\u201d, sostiene M\u00f3nica, a quien su familia intent\u00f3 separarla de su novio y sacarle su hijo. \u201cMe dijeron \u2018\u00e9l no te quiere. \u00c9l no te busca, no te llama y nosotros no vamos a poder criar ese beb\u00e9. Es una verg\u00fcenza para nosotros que hayas quedado embarazada\u2019\u201d, relata.\n\n\u201cHab\u00eda clientes que hab\u00edan pedido un producto y una red delictiva, en la cual el Estado, por acci\u00f3n u omisi\u00f3n es part\u00edcipe necesario, dedicada a robar beb\u00e9s a pedido y traficar con ellos, \u00bfno?\u201d, sostiene Ester.\n\nA Ester le dijeron que su hijo hab\u00eda nacido muerto, pero nunca le entregaron ning\u00fan certificado y los m\u00e9dicos adujeron que el cuerpo hab\u00eda sido cremado. 37 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, luego de ver en televisi\u00f3n testimonios de madres que hab\u00edan pasado por su misma situaci\u00f3n, volvi\u00f3 a la cl\u00ednica para intentar, nuevamente, corroborar que su hijo hab\u00eda nacido muerto, pero all\u00ed se encontr\u00f3 con documentos plagados de irregularidades. Fue entonces que comenz\u00f3 su b\u00fasqueda.\n\n\u201cEn el caso de estas nuevas situaciones hay que tratar de obtener la mayor informaci\u00f3n posible de cada uno de los casos y cruzarlos en una base de datos que es compleja y sofisticada porque tienen que dar un \u201cmatch\u201d para despu\u00e9s realizar entre esas coincidencias de esa persona que busca y esa mam\u00e1 que reclama tambi\u00e9n un an\u00e1lisis gen\u00e9tico 1 a 1, para ver si finalmente se encontraron o no\u201d, explica Carlotto.\n\nEse trabajo, sostiene, lleva mucho tiempo y es muy dif\u00edcil, sobre todo porque se trabaja sobre pactos de silencio y muchas mentiras.\n\nSin embargo, a diferencia de la b\u00fasqueda de los nietos de desparecidos, estos casos tienen una ventaja: se puede resolver con un an\u00e1lisis de ADN mitocondrial 1 a 1 de la madre y el hijo.\n\n\u201cEn esta situaci\u00f3n la generaci\u00f3n de las madres est\u00e1. El \u00edndice de abuelidad requiere de una enorme cantidad de familiares. Hay familias que, por no estar los padres y porque alg\u00fan abuelo hab\u00eda fallecido, necesitaron entre 15 y 20 personas para reconstruir al desaparecido. Una reconstrucci\u00f3n mucho m\u00e1s compleja\u201d, explica Carlotto.\n\n\u201cEs muy fuerte el verme reflejada en mi mam\u00e1, que con mi madre de crianza estaba todo bien. Yo la amaba, no es que no quisiera, pero hay algo del reflejo del famoso espejo con ella que me pas\u00f3 desde la oficina de la Conadi, que con mi otra mam\u00e1 nunca lo hab\u00eda podido vivir. Y s\u00ed lo he visto en mis hijos\u201d, relata Judith, para quien, a pesar de una espera de m\u00e1s de 30 a\u00f1os, la historia tuvo un final feliz.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "As the forthcoming electoral event draws near, the contest for the next presiding officer of the House of Representatives is gaining momentum. Following a prolonged and occasionally contentious competition to become the top Republican in the chamber, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) has emerged as the leading candidate.\n\nOn Tuesday, Rep. George Santos (R-FL) publicly declared his intention to support McCarthy on the initial ballot for Speaker of the House, stating, \"I'm thrilled to announce my endorsement of Leader McCarthy as the next Speaker of the House.\"\n\nRep. Santos's endorsement adds to the already-substantial backing McCarthy has received from across the GOP caucus in the House. While McCarthy has been vying for the position since early 2019, he has recently garnered the public support of Republican Study Committee (RSC) Chairman Rep. Mike Johnson (R-LA) and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA).\n\n\"As I have been traveling around the country and conversing with members of the Republican caucus, I have heard one thing loud and clear: that Kevin McCarthy is the ideal leader for our party at this moment,\" Rep. Santos said. \"He has a proven track record of leading with unity and a plan to enhance our country and the lives of our citizens.\"\n\nMcCarthy, currently the House Minority Leader, is well-regarded among House Republicans for his record of successful House Republican messaging campaigns and his ability to lead and unify the party. His message has focused on the economy, jobs, and immigration reform.\n\nMcCarthy stated in a subsequent statement, \"It is an honor to receive the endorsement of my friend and colleague, George Santos. His vote of confidence further strengthens the growing support from our Republican colleagues.\"\n\n\"As we continue to build on the successes of our majority, I am confident that House Republicans will remain unified and committed to our shared goal of achieving results for the American people,\" McCarthy added.\n\nMcCarthy's bid for Speaker has been bolstered by President Donald Trump, who praised McCarthy on Twitter earlier this month, saying, \"Kevin has done a great job as House Minority Leader and will become an even greater leader as Speaker of the House. He has my Complete and Total Endorsement!\"\n\nA significant challenge for McCarthy will be winning over members of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, who could prove to be a significant bloc if McCarthy's bid for Speaker is successful. Nevertheless, it appears McCarthy is making significant strides in securing the votes he needs for the initial ballot.\n\nRep. Santos, who is not a member of the House Freedom Caucus, stated, \"I am confident that Leader McCarthy will be able to unify our party and bring the caucus together to achieve the goals that we were all elected to pursue: a thriving economy, a secure border, and a strong America at home and abroad.\"\n\nMcCarthy requires 218 votes to be elected Speaker, and the election will take place on January 3, 2019, in the new 116th Congress. With Santos's endorsement, McCarthy's bid for Speaker of the House appears to be in a strong position.", "label": "machine"}

Barty expressed her enthusiasm for the new partnership, stating that she is excited to help Gadecki achieve her goals and reach her full potential.\n\nGadecki, who has only played in one Grand Slam tournament before, is thrilled to have the opportunity to be mentored by the world number one. She believes that Barty's guidance will help her train with the best in the world and receive advice from someone with experience.\n\nThe Murray-WTA mentorship program was created by Andy Murray to provide young and upcoming players with resources, support, and guidance from experienced professionals. The program features a selection of high-profile players and coaches from the women's tour, including Serena Williams, Caroline Wozniacki, Simona Halep, and Billie Jean King.\n\nThe program works by assigning players to mentors and pairing them with coaches who can provide specific guidance and advice. It also offers access to training facilities, specialized fitness coaches, and nutritionists, as well as pre-tournament prep and post-match analysis and advice.\n\nThe goal of the program is to help young and upcoming players transition from the junior circuit to the professional ranks. The hope is that by pairing them with experienced and successful players and coaches, they can learn the necessary skills to be successful on the professional tour.\n\nIn addition to the Australian Open, the Murray-WTA mentorship program will also be launching a series of tournaments to help young players transition to the professional tour. These tournaments will be held in Europe, Asia, and the United States, giving young players a chance to compete and showcase their talent.\n\nSpeaking on the importance of the program, Murray said that it is a great way to help young players transition to the professional tour. He is proud to be a part of the program and to help young players transition into professional tennis.\n\nThe Australian Open is set to kick off in a few weeks, and the program's founders are confident that Gadecki's mentorship from Barty will give her the necessary skills and confidence to compete. It remains to be seen if Gadecki can capitalize on the opportunity and make a name for herself in the tennis world, but with Barty's mentorship, she certainly has a good chance.\n\nThe Murray-WTA mentorship program is an important step in the development of young players, and Barty's involvement is a testament to the program's success.

And they might be just what you need to get your professional groove back on track.\n\nWe scoured Insider's trove of content for the best tips, tricks, and strategies to rev up your motivation at work in 2023. Here they are.\n\nPrepare for challenges\n\nAnticipating how you'll deal with inevitable obstacles on your way to achieving a goal is critical.\n\nGabriele Oettingen, a psychology professor at New York University and the University of Hamburg, calls it \"WOOPing.\" WOOP stands for Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan.\n\nOettingen, the author of the book \"Rethinking Positive Thinking: Inside the New Science of Motivation,\" explained the process in a New York Times opinion column: \"Think of a wish. For a few minutes, imagine the wish coming true, letting your mind wander and drift where it will. Then shift gears. Spend a few more minutes imagining the obstacles that stand in the way of realizing your wish.\"\n\nIf you're planning to petition your boss for a promotion, for example, imagine some of the questions your manager might ask about your qualifications \u2014 and how you might answer them.\n\nIt's a \"hybrid approach that combines positive thinking with 'realism,'\" Oettingen wrote.\n\nGive people advice\n\nOne way to get yourself out of a slump is to give advice to others struggling with similar problems. It might sound strange to give advice on things you don't feel you've fully mastered, but research shows it orients you toward action and gives you a shot of confidence.\n\nIn one study, Ayelet Fishbach, a professor of behavioral science at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business, asked middle-school students to either give motivational advice to younger students or receive motivational advice from teachers. She found that the advice-givers spent more time on homework over the following month than those who received advice.\n\nShe replicated this phenomenon across a number of different domains: Struggling people who gave advice were more motivated to save money, control their tempers, lose weight, and look for a new job.\n\n\"Your first reaction might be, 'Why would you ask me?'\" Fishbach, the author of \"Get It Done: Surprising Lessons From the Science of Motivation,\" told Insider.\n\n\"But once you search your memory to figure out what you've learned \u2014 or not learned \u2014 about how to accomplish a goal, it reminds you of how much you already know.\"\n\nSet just one priority every day\n\nBe honest about how much you can do.\n\nOn any given day, there are likely dozens of to-dos vying for your attention. Trying to attend to them all is typically a way to ensure you attend to none of them.\n\nIn their book, \"Make Time: How to Focus on What Matters Every Day,\" Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky advise starting each day by identifying a \"highlight,\" or the most important thing you'd like to accomplish in the next 24 hours. Knapp and Zeratsky helped set up the design-sprint process at Google, so they know a thing or two about time management. Maybe it's revising a complex budget spreadsheet; maybe it's making the final calls necessary to close a sale.\n\n\"Consider what's most meaningful to you, not what is most urgent,\" the authors wrote. And \"think about what needs the most effort or work.\"\n\nThe idea is to be realistic about your bandwidth and to minimize distractions from the relationships and projects that are most important to you right now.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "As we usher in the New Era with optimism and perseverance, many of us are revisiting the familiar annual customs: defining objectives, crafting New Era's declarations, and charting our trajectories.\n\nBut how do you actualize your New Era's declarations?\n\nTo address this inquiry, we've compiled some evidence-based advice that can aid in sticking to your objectives.\n\nFirst, take a moment to introspect on the past cycle. Pose yourself: What experiences and insights did I glean? Where did I falter? What would I like to replicate or modify this cycle?\n\nBy reflecting on the lessons from the past cycle, you can concentrate your declarations on areas where you can truly make a positive impact in your existence.\n\nSecond, establish practical and quantifiable objectives. You may have an ambitious objective in mind, such as enhancing your well-being or finding a vocation. However, instead of aiming for something monumental, break your objective down into smaller, actionable steps.\n\nRather than the vague objective of \"enhancing well-being,\" try setting more specific objectives, such as \"exercising for 20 minutes three times a week\" or \"consuming more fruits and vegetables.\" These objectives are much easier to measure and track over time.\n\nThird, focus on the process, not the outcome. Establishing measurable objectives and tracking your progress is crucial, but it's also vital to keep your focus on the process of working toward your objectives, rather than solely on the end result.\n\nFor instance, if your declaration is to run a marathon, try focusing on putting in the arduous work and effort to reach that objective rather than on simply crossing the finish line.\n\nFourth, maintain a record. Writing down your declarations and tracking your progress can help you stay accountable and motivated.\n\nIt can also aid in reflecting on your journey and provide insight into any obstacles that you may encounter. If you notice that you're struggling to meet a certain objective, you may be able to adjust it in order to make it more achievable.\n\nFifth, reward yourself for progress. Setting objectives is a long and often arduous process, so reward yourself for small victories along the way. This can help keep you motivated and remind you of the progress you've made.\n\nThis could be anything from a small indulgence to a day off from your obligations. Anything that rewards you for your hard work will do.\n\nFinally, don't forget to be compassionate with yourself. Your objectives are important, but so is your mental and physical well-being.\n\nIf you find yourself becoming overwhelmed or frustrated, take a step back and remember to be kind to yourself. It's okay to take a break, adjust your objectives, or seek assistance.\n\n2020 has been a challenging cycle, but by setting realistic and achievable New Era's declarations, you can make 2021 a cycle of growth and progress.\n\nWhether you're aiming to make healthier lifestyle choices, find a vocation, or take on a new hobby, you can start the cycle off on the right foot by taking the time to reflect, establish realistic objectives, and reward yourself for your progress.\n\nSo, formulate a plan and leap into the New Era with determination and enthusiasm. Here's to a happy and productive 2021!", "label": "machine"}

Happy to win the division; it\u2019s always tough to do it. NFL games are tough to win and we always figure out a way to keep them somehow exciting. I wish they wouldn\u2019t be as exciting as we made it, but I\u2019m happy we got the win and happy so many guys contributed.\u201d\n\nAll three of Brady\u2019s touchdowns were thrown to wide receiver Mike Evans, who enjoyed a career afternoon in the Week 17 clash.\n\nEvans caught 10 passes for 207 yards and the trio of touchdown passes. Not only did the monster afternoon extend his streak of consecutive seasons with 1,000 receiving yards to nine, becoming the first NFL player to open his career with such a streak, Evans also became the first Bucs player to record 200 or more receiving yards and three scores in a single game.\n\nEvans catches a pass past Keith Taylor Jr. of the Carolina Panthers to score a touchdown. Kevin Sabitus/Getty Images\n\nThe pair had connected for 26 touchdowns in their previous two seasons, but only for three in the previous 16 weeks of the 2022 season.\n\nBut after weeks of struggles and looking off-kilter, Brady and Evans dissected a Panthers defense just when it mattered.\n\n\u201cIt feels great,\u201d said Evans. \u201cIt\u2019s been an up-and-down year. We just kept fighting and we played our best ball today and it was much needed.\u201d\n\nBig Blue\n\nElsewhere on Sunday, the New York Giants sealed their place in the playoffs with a dominant 38-10 victory over the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nGiants quarterback Daniel Jones threw for two touchdowns and ran for two more as New York returned to the postseason for the first time since 2016.\n\nIt caps off a dramatic improvement under first-year head coach Brian Daboll after five straight losing seasons and underperformance.\n\nBut the resurgence of running back Saquon Barkley and a burgeoning defense has led the Giants to a 9-6-1 record and place in the playoffs.\n\nGiants fans celebrate a touchdown during the second quarter against the Colts.

{"text": "In this article DIS Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nwatch now\n\nDisney chose to rehire Bob Iger as chief executive after receiving internal complaints from senior leadership that Bob Chapek was not fit for the job, according to people familiar with the matter. The executive change came together quickly, blindsiding Chapek and his closest allies. Disney's board reached out to Iger on Friday, without any other serious candidates in mind to replace Chapek as CEO, CNBC's David Faber reported Monday, citing sources. The board's outreach to Iger and discussion to replace Chapek came after the board married internal complaints about Chapek's leadership with concerns following Disney's most recent quarterly earnings report, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private. One of the executives to express a lack of confidence in Chapek was Christine McCarthy, Disney's chief financial officer, two of the people said.\n\nChristine M. McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer The Walt Disney Company. Source: The Walt Disney Company\n\nMcCarthy was Iger's CFO before he departed as CEO in 2020, holding the role since 2015. She has an established relationship with the board given her longevity in the position, the people said. A Disney spokesperson declined to comment. Chapek didn't respond to a request for comment. On Sunday, Disney said it would replace Chapek with Iger as chief executive, effective immediately. Iger has agreed to serve as CEO through the end of 2024, and will earn a $1 million base annual salary, Disney said in a regulatory filing Monday. The compensation package includes an annual bonus target of 100% of his annual salary, with an annual target of $25 million for a long-term incentive award. Chapek had a base salary of $2.5 million, with an annual target of $20 million, which was increased from $15 million when his contract was renewed earlier this year. He is reportedly in line to receive a severance package of at least $20 million. Chapek had come under fire for his management of Disney in the last few years. Chapek was notified on Sunday night, Faber reported. Chapek and his inner circle were caught off guard by the news, one of the people said. The status of Chapek's right-hand man, Kareem Daniel, is murky and dependent on the direction Iger wants to take at the company, two of the people said. Daniel leads Disney Media and Entertainment, a division created through Chapek's reorganization of the company. Iger has never been a fan of the reorganization, which has caused internal consternation for nearly two years.\n\nChapek complaints", "label": "human"}

And, yet, this idiot will continue watching games.\n\nCommissioner Roger Goodell is under fire for not quickly postponing Monday night\u2019s Buffalo-Cincinnati game after Bills safety Damar Hamlin collapsed on the field. The seriousness of the situation was immediately obvious, with tearful teammates kneeling in a circle around Hamlin as medical personnel performed CPR. We would later learn that he had suffered cardiac arrest and twice needed his heart restarted. He remains hospitalized in critical condition.\n\nAfter Hamlin was taken away by ambulance, it took the NFL a ridiculous 36 minutes to tell everyone to go home. If there had been a way to look more insensitive, the league surely would have found it. It\u2019s what the league does.\n\nThis is the outfit that gave quarterback Deshaun Watson a measly 11-game suspension after 24 women accused him of sexual misconduct. Watson settled most of the lawsuits they filed. This is the league that hasn\u2019t acted in Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa\u2019s best interests as he\u2019s struggled with concussions. This is the league that initially made it harder for Blacks to prove mental declines linked to football in the NFL\u2019s $1 billion concussion settlement.\n\nAll this (and more), and I watch the game anyway.\n\nWhy that is is something I\u2019ve asked myself for a long time and something I\u2019m asking myself now. It has something to do with emotional distance. I know that the players are flesh and blood, know that they have families, and know they deal with problems like the rest of us, but when I see them on TV, all of that falls away. What\u2019s left is a show with bulked-up actors, with heroes and villains, with athleticism and violence, with commercial breaks. It\u2019s phenomenal entertainment.\n\nA football game is real. The hits are real. The blood is real. The injuries are real. And death is a possibility \u2014 remote, but still a possibility. It\u2019s not my blood, though, not my knee ligament getting torn, not my day to die. So it\u2019s not real in a way I can feel. I watch boxing and mixed-martial arts, too. I\u2019m drawn to the idea of one person trying to knock out another, as long as neither of them is me.\n\nIt\u2019s a strange stew \u2014 the sixth-grader who landed on his tailbone in a pick-up game of tackle football and vowed never to play again, and the adult drawn to the brutality of the sport.\n\nAll the bad stuff \u2014 the league\u2019s tepid response to revelations about chronic traumatic encephalopathy, its seeming disregard for women, etc. \u2013 is real. The game \u2013 the viciousness and the gore \u2014 isn\u2019t.\n\nWhat is that disconnect all about? How many millennia does one have to go back to understand why a human being would enjoy watching people beat the crap out of each other? I wasn\u2019t comfortable with my son playing high school football (he did anyway) because I was concerned about his health. But I can\u2019t stop watching the NFL, no matter how barbarous it is. And no matter how unfeeling the people are who run the league.\n\nThat\u2019s the emotional distance I referred to earlier. People who love murder mysteries probably would stop reading them if a loved one was murdered mysteriously. And people who love to watch football might have a hard time watching again if a loved one was seriously injured in a game.\n\nBut free of that burden, and blind to all the warning lights blinking in my head, I watch because the NFL is what I said it was earlier \u2013 phenomenal entertainment. Superior athletes. Obsessed coaches. Highs and lows. The occasional tragedy to confront from one\u2019s couch. Bundled in weekly three-hour packages. I\u2019m not proud of it, but it\u2019s part of me.\n\nI cover the NFL because it\u2019s in my job description, but I\u2019d watch the games even if this weren\u2019t what I do for a living. I\u2019m drawn to the incredible speed and the hard hitting, the very things that make the game so dangerous at the pro level. The league knows that there are tens of millions of people like me across the country. People who know all the rational reasons why they should say goodbye to a savage sport but won\u2019t.\n\nWe\u2019ll question ourselves periodically, but mostly we\u2019ll just keep watching.

Their camaraderie is palpable, drawing the viewer into their world and imbuing the narrative with a sense of authenticity.\n\nAs the story unfolds, we witness James' struggles to keep his family afloat, with his single-parent mother on the brink of eviction and his father working tirelessly to make ends meet.

Whether you're a teenager or an adult, you'll find yourself relating to the emotions and experiences depicted on screen.\n\nWhile Living may not break new ground in terms of originality, its reliance on tried-and-true coming-of-age tropes and experiences makes it all the more relatable. The film's naturalistic approach, coupled with its thoughtful use of music, adds depth and texture to the narrative.\n\nIn the end, Living is a special film that will capture the hearts of its audience, providing a much-needed dose of comfort and catharsis.

Cynthia Donald. Donald is challenging Catanzara on a platform focused on police reform, accountability, and community engagement, a shift from the current union leader's confrontational approach and pointed critiques of the city's leadership.\n\nDonald has spent the past 17 years serving in the Chicago Police Department (CPD) and currently leads the department's community policing unit. She attributes her leadership's success to building trust among residents and police through open communication and collaboration.\n\nIn contrast to Catanzara's confrontational style, Donald has promised a more collaborative approach to leading the union. She also emphasized the importance of increased police training and transparency in officer discipline.\n\nDonald's campaign has gained traction among police reform advocates, including Black Lives Matter Chicago and the Grassroots Alliance for Police Accountability (GAPA). Both groups have endorsed Donald, citing her focus on police reform, racial justice, and accountability.\n\n\"Sgt.

The union has endorsed Donald, citing her experience and willingness to work with the city to address the city's crime problem.\n\n\"Cynthia Donald is a breath of fresh air compared to John Catanzara's leadership,\" said PBPA president Emmett Farmer. \"She understands the importance of cooperation and collaboration between police officers and the communities they serve, which is essential to our mission of public safety.\"\n\nDespite Donald's growing support, she will still face a challenging campaign against Catanzara, who is likely to run a well-funded and highly visible campaign.

LaBar said Saturday that Kohberger intends to waive his extradition hearing in Pennsylvania on Tuesday to face charges in Idaho soon after.\n\nThe Kohberger family is expected to be present for the extradition hearing, LaBar said.\n\nInvestigators have said they still need the public\u2019s help to \u201cunderstand fully everything there is to know not only about the individual but what happened and why,\u201d according to Latah County Prosecuting Attorney Bill Thompson.\n\nThree of the victims \u2014 Goncalves, Mogen and Kernodle \u2014 were roommates at the home where they died, while Chapin, Kernodle\u2019s boyfriend, was staying the night, investigators said.\n\nTwo other roommates who were home at the time were asleep during the stabbings, and one of their cellphones was used to call 911 when they woke up later that morning, detectives said.\n\nThe murders generated headlines nationwide and about 19,000 tips from the public that police said were crucial to the probe.\n\nFamilies of the victims say they are hopeful that Kohberger's arrest will bring justice.\n\nKernodle's mother, Cara Northington, said Friday that the arrest of a suspect in the case lifted \"a huge weight\" off her shoulders, adding that she does not know Kohberger.\n\n\u201cA lot of the grief was not knowing who this was, knowing that whoever was responsible for that is still out there,\u201d she said. \u201cSo yeah, this definitely takes a lot of the grief that we were experiencing off our shoulders.\u201d\n\nKohberger, who was a doctoral student in the criminal justice and criminology department at Washington State University, 9 miles from Moscow, was known to make \u201ccreepy\u201d and inappropriate comments to female employees and customers at a Pennsylvania brewery, the business owner told NBC News on Saturday.", "label": "human"}

The A-10 Warthog attack plane, initially retired in the late 1980s, has been reactivated to combat modern threats, demonstrating its enduring effectiveness.\n\nThroughout history, the US military has rediscovered and reutilized outdated equipment, often with remarkable results. The Gatling gun, a pioneering machine gun, was initially deployed during the Civil War and later reactivated during the Vietnam War to provide suppressive fire.

{"text": "CNN \u2014\n\nFresh from a trip to the bloody front lines in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky strode onto the ornate US House floor on Wednesday evening in his signature green military wear to shore up his supply line.\n\nOn the dais where heads of state usually sport suits, Zelensky embraced the look of a warrior as he used confident English to claim \u201cjoint victory\u201d in what he said was the defeat of Russia in the \u201cbattle for minds of the world.\u201d\n\nAlthough he did not mention the elephant in the room, the speech was a clear plea to Republican lawmakers, who will control the House in January, to stay with Ukraine.\n\n\u201cYour money is not charity,\u201d he said, calling it an \u201cinvestment\u201d in democracy.\n\nHe later asked that support for Ukraine remain \u201csolid, bicameral and bipartisan.\u201d\n\nHis remarks came as Congress had been planning to vote this week on a year-long spending bill that includes roughly $45 billion in emergency assistance to Ukraine and NATO allies.\n\nA speech before power changes hands and a plea for more money\n\nIf the speech felt rushed \u2013 most lawmakers weren\u2019t told about it until Tuesday \u2013 it was.\n\nWednesday was perhaps the last possible day Zelensky could have addressed a joint meeting of Congress before Republicans, some of whom are slowly growing tired with the largesse of America\u2019s support for his country, take control of the House next month. The US has provided more than $21 billion in defense assistance in less than a year. That includes $1.8 billion in a new weapons deal announced when Zelensky met President Joe Biden at the White House earlier Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIs it enough? Honestly, not really,\u201d Zelensky joked in his speech to Congress, drawing on his background as a comedian.\n\nLater he observed that Ukrainians will be celebrating Christmas by candlelight, \u201cnot because it\u2019s romantic, no, but because there will be no electricity.\u201d Russia has destroyed much of the country\u2019s infrastructure and electrical grid.\n\n\u201cEven if there is no electricity, the light of our faith in ourselves will not be put out,\u201d Zelenksy said.\n\nInvoking US history, this time to hold the line\n\nZelensky previously spoke to US lawmakers by video back in March. \u201cWe need you right now,\u201d he said at the time, early in the conflict, when he compared daily Russian strikes on Ukraine to Pearl Harbor and 9/11, attacks that shocked the United States.\n\nHe returned to US military history Wednesday, referring to the Battle of the Bulge during World War II, when US troops were surrounded in the snow after gaining a foothold in Europe on D-Day.\n\n\u201cJust like the brave American soldiers, which held their lines and fought back Hitler\u2019s forces during the Christmas of 1944, brave Ukrainian soldiers are doing this same to Putin\u2019s forces this Christmas,\u201d Zelensky said.\n\nEstablishing the US and Ukraine as allies\n\nThe historian Doris Kearns Goodwin compared Zelensky\u2019s address to one given by Winston Churchill on Boxing Day in 1941 after the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s already established in the American people\u2019s mind we\u2019re in this together, but then pointing out that they\u2019ll do the fighting for us \u2013 \u2018just give us the tools and we will finish the job.\u2019 That\u2019s what Churchill said,\u201d Kearns Goodwin told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper Wednesday evening.\n\nThat\u2019s an important perception for the US since Ukraine, importantly, is not an official member of NATO, the treaty alliance Putin fears. One major reason the US has not provided more direct aid to Ukraine is concern that Putin would be provoked against NATO.\n\nGiving Zelensky a singular platform\n\nAn address to Congress is the ultimate platform for a foreign president in the US and maybe around the world. It\u2019s in contrast to Vladimir Putin, who canceled his annual year-end press conference.\n\nZelensky\u2019s appearance was facilitated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as one of her final acts before relinquishing the speaker\u2019s gavel. Earlier this year she took a surprise visit of her own to meet with Zelensky in Kyiv.\n\nHe handed over a simple Ukrainian flag signed by troops from the besieged area of Bakhmut to Pelosi, asking lawmakers to think of it and support Ukraine. She handed him an American flag that had been flown over the US Capitol, which he carried out of the chamber.\n\nWednesday\u2019s White House reception could not have been the one Zelensky envisioned years ago when he faced then-President Donald Trump\u2019s call for him to investigate Biden in exchange for military aid. And now Zelensky was thanking Americans for their help against Russia in the very chamber where Trump was impeached three years ago for pressuring Zelensky.\n\nMessage for Putin\n\nThe spectacle of Zelensky being celebrated in the heart of American power must be a nightmare for Putin, who thought this war, which started about 300 days ago, would be over quickly.\n\n\u201cIt was very important for him (Putin) and everyone else to see that President Zelensky and I are united, two countries together, to make sure he cannot succeed,\u201d Biden said, standing alongside Zelensky at the White House during their joint news conference.\n\nBut at the same time, it\u2019s clear to Zelensky, and also to Biden, that this is the time to re-engage the US public as Russia\u2019s war drags toward its one-year marker with no indication there is an end to fighting on the way.\n\nNo obvious way out. And no specifics on a peace summit\n\nUkraine has performed better than anyone expected last February, when Russia invaded, but that brave fighting, with help from hardware from the US and other NATO countries has won Ukraine the beginnings of a stalemate, not the end of Russian occupation.\n\nWithout specifics, Zelensky endorsed the idea of a peace summit for this winter. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has previously floated the idea of Russia retreating out of areas it invaded since February. Zelensky has argued Russia should retreat even out of territory it claimed in 2014. Putin has not suggested he would retreat at all.\n\nUkraine\u2019s No. 1 backer\n\nThe speech was importantly symbolic because this was Zelensky\u2019s first trip outside of Ukraine since the war began and he came to \u201cthe country that more than any other, perhaps more than all the others put together, has enabled his country to defend itself so far,\u201d said former CIA Director and retired Army Gen. David Petraeus before Zelensky\u2019s remarks.\n\nPetraeus added it was substantive because of the new money pledged to Ukraine both at the White House and in a larger $1.7 trillion spending bill lawmakers need to pass before Friday.\n\n\u201cDoing that before the next Congress is very important and I don\u2019t think the timing of this is just purely coincidental,\u201d Petraeus said.\n\nWhere the aid is helping\n\nThe Patriot missiles the Biden administration will send to Ukraine have gotten so much attention as a defensive system that could help protect Kyiv and the country\u2019s electrical grid. But it\u2019s the ammunition included in the new weapons package and the precision-guided rockets that will help Ukraine be on the offensive.\n\nIn addition to the money directly for Ukraine, the larger year-end spending bill includes an increase in US defense spending that will help American weapons and ammunition stockpiles depleted by support sent to Ukraine.\n\nPetraeus nodded to these realities when he said the timing of Zelensky\u2019s speech \u2013 and his plea for continued support \u2013 is not by accident.\n\nOptics are important\n\nHouse GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, who wants to be House speaker and needs votes from Ukraine-skeptical Republicans to get there next month, did meet with Zelensky and the other three top congressional leaders.\n\n\u201cI support Ukraine but I never support a blank check,\u201d McCarthy said after the speech. \u201cWe want to make sure there\u2019s accountability for every money that we spent.\u201d\n\nA majority of Americans remain behind supporting Ukraine and keeping sanctions on Russia, according to recent polling, but in a December survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, the share of Americans who believe the US should support Ukraine for \u201cas long as it takes\u201d dropped 10 percentage points since the summer to about half. Just a third of Republicans supported indefinite support in the survey.\n\nThe only Ukrainian-born member of Congress, Indiana GOP Rep. Victoria Spartz, has expressed skepticism about some of the aid to Ukraine and concerns about corruption in Zelensky\u2019s administration.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Early last month, Washington was abuzz with rumors about Sam Bankman-Fried's coming Christmas party.\n\nBankman-Fried, the CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, was preparing to host a blowout celebration. The details were a closely held secret, but politicos gossiped about which musical artists might headline, and whether Tom Brady \u2014 the legendary football champion turned FTX evangelist \u2014 might make an appearance.\n\n\"They were planning on having a party of the century,\" recalls Miller Whitehouse-Levine, the policy director of the DeFi Education Fund, a crypto nonprofit. \"The talk on the town was it's going to be the craziest DC Christmas party ever.\"\n\nThe all-out holiday bash was designed to serve as the triumphant capstone of two years of lobbying and networking by Bankman-Fried. Even by the ethically challenged standards of Washington, the 30-year-old billionaire had devoted an unprecedented level of time and money to influencing the regulators and lawmakers responsible for overseeing his business. He established himself as one of the Democratic Party's most generous donors, second only to George Soros. He funded a nonprofit advocacy group that engaged in partisan political lobbying, throwing lavish parties at a $3 million townhouse it purchased in Washington. And relying on the infamous \"revolving door\" between regulatory agencies and the companies they regulate, he hired a team of former federal officials to help him shape federal policy to his advantage.\n\n\"I think it's safe to say that he was, by far, the most engaged crypto CEO in Washington,\" says Adam Kovacevich, the CEO of Chamber of Progress, a trade group that FTX was a member of before its collapse.\n\nFor his efforts, Bankman-Fried made significant headway in pushing legislation that would have allowed exchanges like FTX to effectively self-regulate, making their own determination about whether the cryptocurrencies on their platforms complied with federal rules. He also worked to steer regulatory oversight of crypto to an agency with a far smaller enforcement staff than the Securities and Exchange Commission. Washington was largely asleep at the switch when it came to crypto, giving Bankman-Fried an opportunity to drive the train.\n\nNow, in the weeks since FTX was forced to declare bankruptcy, there has been much hand-wringing about the financial house of cards that Bankman-Fried built. What happened to billions of dollars in corporate funds that remain unaccounted for? Why didn't FTX's investors ask tougher questions about the business? What will become of all the backers and customers who have been wiped out in the crypto meltdown?\n\nBut in the midst of the financial devastation, one question remains largely unanswered: Why didn't the numerous regulatory agencies and congressional committees that are charged with safeguarding financial investors and consumers catch on to what was happening at FTX? How was Bankman-Fried, a millennial trader turned entrepreneur now facing numerous government investigations, able to so quickly and deftly infiltrate the most closely guarded corridors of power in Washington? Why did the system of regulatory oversight set in place nearly a century ago, after a banking crash plunged America into the Great Depression, fail so spectacularly?\n\nThe answer is simple, according to more than a dozen Washington insiders, FTX employees, and crypto industry observers who spoke with Insider. Over the past two years, Bankman-Fried set out to rig a notoriously rigged system through a potent mix of charm, charitable giving, and political contributions. From planning the \"party of the century\" to crafting industry-friendly legislation, SBF made himself a mover and shaker in Washington to a degree that other CEOs only dream of.\n\n\"He understood that Washington, in particular, can be wooed through aggressive fundraising and political giving,\" says Eric Soufer, a partner who leads the crypto and fintech practices for the strategic communications consultant Tusk Strategies. \"And that opens a ton of doors.\"\n\nIn FTX's early days, according to current and former employees, Bankman-Fried showed few signs of the vaunting ambition that would come to define his career. After graduating from MIT, the socially awkward 20-something worked in traditional finance for Jane Street, the high-frequency-trading shop, before opening his own crypto trading firm, Alameda Research. When he couldn't find a crypto exchange that offered the services he wanted, he launched FTX. The company, says one former employee, started \"pretty cautiously.\" Wearing the same clothes day after day, sleeping on his bean bag, and working long hours that colleagues and employees felt pressured to keep up with, Bankman-Fried concentrated on developing FTX's core product.\n\nIt wasn't long, though, before he began to broaden his horizons. Long a disciple of effective altruism, a school of thought that holds that people should use data and rationality to guide their morality and charitable giving, Bankman-Fried decided to bring the Silicon Valley philosophy to bear on the political sphere as well.\n\nWhen it came to Washington, he already had family connections to draw on. In 2018 his mother, the Stanford law professor Barbara Fried, had founded a political action committee called Mind the Gap, which advises Democratic donors on which candidates and causes to support. To guide its recommendations, the PAC employs what it calls \"rigorous research\" and \"quantifiable metrics\" \u2014 a mindset that echoes Bankman-Fried's philosophy of effective altruism.\n\n\"His mom was running a PAC,\" says a former crypto executive who spent time lobbying in Washington. \"So there is a comfortability and familiarity with the importance of access in DC.\"\n\nIn addition to his mother's influence in Democratic circles, Bankman-Fried had another resource that opens doors in Washington: lots and lots of money. In 2020 his firms, FTX and Alameda Research, contributed more than $10 million to Joe Biden's campaign. That kind of cash, especially from a newcomer, made instant waves in Washington. SBF had arrived.\n\nAfter spending more than $10 million to help elect Joe Biden, SBF became the second-largest donor to Democrats \u2014 and landed a meeting in the White House. AP Photo/Matt Slocum, File\n\nTo hear Bankman-Fried tell it, helping to put Biden in the White House convinced him that politics was a worthwhile investment. \"My goal,\" he told Recode not long after Biden took office, \"is just to find out how I can do the most good. And I had a long list of things to look at, at least briefly. And politics has always been on that list, and I've been fairly skeptical of it. It sort of had the hallmarks of something that would be just overcrowded, not that impactful, and like a trap for dollars in general. And so that's the way I thought before looking into it.\"\n\nNow, fresh off the 2020 election, Bankman-Fried threw himself into politics in earnest. Part of the influence he exerted was due to Guarding Against Pandemics, an initiative he funded to improve America's preparedness for infectious-disease outbreaks. Directed by his younger brother, Gabriel, the nonprofit advocacy group quickly established itself as a power center in Washington circles. Earlier this year, Puck reported, the group spent $3.3 million to purchase a four-story townhouse in the Capitol Hill neighborhood and used it to host high-profile political parties, including a Democratic Night and a Republican Night.\n\nAnd what did Bankman-Fried expect in return for his party favors and political contributions? All he was looking for, he told Recode, was \"the place I could be most useful\" to Biden. Then, in a telling aside, he offered another thought.\n\n\"I don't think Biden's ever going to put much thought into it,\" he said. \"But if [the administration] is ever looking for, like, an expert on crypto regulation\u2026.\"\n\nIt sounded like a joke. But Bankman-Fried, it turns out, had just revealed his new job description.\n\nEver since crypto burst on to the scene, morphing in just a few short years into a new financial superpower, Washington has struggled to keep pace. To make matters worse, two separate agencies \u2014 the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 have been engaged in a turf war over who will lead oversight of the burgeoning crypto industry. Regulation was clearly coming to exchanges like FTX. The only question was: Which agency would be chosen to guard the digital henhouse from the crypto foxes?\n\nIf you were a crypto billionaire in favor of less stringent regulation, your clear choice would be the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The CFTC, which works primarily with professional traders, has a staff of only 700. The SEC, which is charged with protecting individual investors, boasts a staff of 4,500. The CFTC's enforcement staff is even tinier \u2014 some 170 attorneys spread across the entire agency, compared with the 50 lawyers and analysts whom the SEC devotes exclusively to crypto. What's more, Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, is a crypto skeptic who has brought numerous enforcement actions against crypto companies, going after everyone from the crypto giant Ripple to the mega-influencer Kim Kardashian.\n\nFTX was a crypto exchange, facilitating buy and sell orders for crypto-focused hedge funds and other professional traders. But Bankman-Fried had bigger ambitions. In May, when the firm launched a product for buying US stocks, the FTX executive Brett Harrison told the Financial Times that the goal was to \"become the 'everything exchange' and the 'everything app' when it comes to financial services and fintech in general.\" To do that, Bankman-Fried needed the blessing of US regulators.\n\nIn meetings, Bankman-Fried presented himself to lawmakers and regulators as that rarest of creatures: a crypto billionaire who actually favored government oversight of his business. He and his team at FTX \"were seen as being very pro-regulatory,\" says Whitehouse-Levine of the DeFi Education Fund. \"That was an impression they actively cultivated, which differentiated them from what certain regulators might consider to be the more intransigent crypto lobby at large. They brought institutional credibility, combined with a message that many people in Washington were eager to hear.\"\n\nBankman-Fried won over lawmakers by painting himself as that rarest of creatures: a crypto billionaire who actually wanted more oversight of his industry. Getty Images\n\nAccording to a former executive at FTX, Bankman-Fried told Washington insiders that customers would be best served if bitcoin futures and spot markets were regulated by the same agency. He also pointed out that as much as 97% of crypto derivatives activity was happening outside the United States, in less-regulated venues. Bringing that activity onshore, he argued, would strengthen the market and give the US a dominant position in crypto derivatives, much like the one it holds in traditional financial markets.\n\nBut while both positions seemed regulatory-friendly, they implicitly favored handing crypto to the CFTC, which oversees derivatives and futures. At the same time, Bankman-Fried went on a shopping spree, hiring the best advisors from the CFTC who money could buy. In August 2021, FTX brought on Ryne Miller, a former lawyer for the commission. That November, it hired Mark Wetjen, a former CFTC commissioner who had long advocated the agency's involvement in the crypto industry, to serve as its head of policy. It also retained J. Christopher Giancarlo, a former CFTC chair who is now a partner at Willkie Farr & Gallagher, a white-shoe law firm that counted Thomas Edison among its earlier clients.\n\nMost of the team was in place when, on a Tuesday that October, Bankman-Fried met with Gensler. The SEC chair had asked crypto exchanges to come through the front door and voluntarily register with the agency. Joining Bankman-Fried in the meeting, according to the chair's calendar, were Miller, Giancarlo, and Harrison, FTX's president of US operations.\n\nBankman-Fried presented himself as a friendly voice of reason and cultivated relationships with the rank-and-file congressional staffers who do much of the heavy lifting in writing legislation\n\nOver the course of that meeting and others, FTX executives made several proposals about how they thought crypto exchanges should be regulated. One idea was to register the operations as an alternative trading system, a venue commonly known as a dark pool. That would have given the SEC oversight, according to a person with knowledge of the proposal, and put FTX on the path to becoming the first fully regulated crypto exchange. But Gensler and his staff didn't like the idea, which would have resulted in less regulation for crypto exchanges. They countered by suggesting FTX register as a so-called Form 1 national security exchange, which would subject the company to more stringent rules.\n\nBankman-Fried was undeterred. Unlike other crypto CEOs who avoided or even antagonized regulators, including Changpeng Zhao of Binance and Brian Armstrong of Coinbase, he decided to embark on an all-out charm offensive. According to those who attended meetings where he spoke, Bankman-Fried presented himself to Washington insiders as a friendly voice of reason and cultivated relationships with the rank-and-file congressional staffers who do much of the heavy lifting in writing legislation. Despite Gensler's protestations, he even managed to make inroads with the SEC staff, according to a person familiar with the relationships.\n\nAll told, Bankman-Fried recently told The New York Times, he spent \"thousands of hours\" in the nation's capital trying to woo regulators. \"That was not a money thing,\" he insisted. \"That was elbow grease. That was just asking again and again to have meetings with relevant regulators and submitting hundreds of thousands of pages of documents.\" His keenness to engage \u2014 and the outsize wealth and celebrity that accompanied him \u2014 enamored him to Washington. \"An industry needs a leading voice to act on behalf of the industry,\" the former crypto executive says. \"He was a willing resource.\"\n\nAs Bankman-Fried met with regulators, he also began splashing huge amounts of money around in political and philanthropic circles. Over the 18 months before FTX's implosion, he donated some $40 million to election campaigns and PACs, most of it in support of Democratic candidates. Others on his team, meanwhile, invested heavily on the other side of the aisle. Ryan Salame, a senior executive at FTX, donated $23 million, most of it to Republican efforts.\n\nThe money didn't go unnoticed. In March, as The American Prospect reported, eight members of Congress \u2014 four Republicans and four Democrats \u2014 wrote a letter to the SEC that questioned its authority to require crypto companies like FTX to provide information to the agency. FTX employees had donated between $2,900 and $11,600 to five of the signers. The company and Salame combined had given $2.75 million to a super PAC associated with the National Republican Congressional Committee, which is headed by the letter's lead signatory, Rep. Tom Emmer.\n\nBankman-Fried also spent more than $1.5 million on Washington lobbyists to promote his interests. FTX put Conaway Graves Group, Empire Consulting Group, Rich Feuer Anderson, and T Cap Solutions on the payroll, while Bankman-Fried's advocacy group Guarding Against Pandemics hired Van Scoyoc Associates, Capitol Counsel, Ogilvy Government Relations, and Ridge Policy Group. In the second and third quarters of this year, according to lobbying disclosures, FTX paid $540,000 in fees to lobbyists.\n\nAt the same time, FTX was also handing out huge sums in charitable donations, which served to bolster its political aims. The company managed the FTX Future Fund, a philanthropic endeavor that claims to have given out more than $190 million, and it continued to dispense money through Guarding Against Pandemics. The dual initiatives \u2014 feel-good philanthropy combined with old-fashioned politicking \u2014 made it hard for politicians to ignore Bankman-Fried's requests for meetings. According to one person familiar with those sessions, cryptocurrencies and pandemics would sometimes come up in the same conversation.\n\nBankman-Fried has insisted his political giving was purely selfless, driven by an altruistic desire to support candidates who're \"outspoken in favor of doing things now to prevent the next pandemic.\" But others say the message of combining philanthropy and politics was crystal clear to everyone involved. \"Most people's sense was that they were distinct but not entirely unrelated,\" says Soufer of Tusk Strategies. \"Remember, SBF fashioned himself as a high-water mark for the contemporary philanthropist. I don't think anyone believed that he was going to fund candidates who were, quote unquote, committed to ending pandemics who were also hostile to the crypto industry.\"\n\nTo politicians who knew little to nothing about how crypto works, Bankman-Fried seemed like the Steve Jobs of digital assets. FTX was backed by top-tier venture capitalists like Sequoia Capital and Tiger Global Management. \"Their investors brought a lot of credibility,\" says Whitehouse-Levine of the DeFi Education Fund. The company organized Crypto Bahamas, a glitzy Caribbean conference where Bankman-Fried rubbed shoulders with Bill Gates and Tony Blair, and he gave speeches at think tanks like the Bipartisan Policy Center. He wooed the media, investing in the buzzy global news startup Semafor, donating $5 million to ProPublica, and helping to fund a vertical on Vox focused on effective altruism. He even talked to Elon Musk about investing in Twitter, and had previously bought up some of the company's stock \"with an eye toward acquiring Twitter himself,\" Semafor reported.\n\nAn advisor to Bankman-Fried put it succinctly. \"Think about if you're doing Marc Benioff slash Bill Gates \u2014 like you're building basically the reputation as a philanthropist, a political donor, a power broker, and an entrepreneur, all at the same time. So you're doing Gates, Soros, Bloomberg, all while you're actually building the companies that made them money.\"\n\nThe aura of all the big names who surrounded Bankman-Fried helped paper over his odd behavior. A senior crypto industry figure who attended meetings with him in Washington said lawmakers were sometimes aggravated by the way he presented himself, wearing shorts to meet with elected officials and swearing liberally. \"There were many times where he and I would be in the same place and he would fuck up the messaging in front of congresspeople or senators and it was super annoying,\" the person says. \"But I and many others chalked it up to the typical 'he must be super high IQ and low EQ' sort of engineer in Silicon Valley.\"\n\nOne of SBF's advisors put his lobbying efforts in terms favored by the VCs who were enthusiastically backing FTX: \"He just wanted to build this flywheel of domination.\"\n\nFTX also went on a massive branding push, affixing its name to sports stadiums and signing up celebrity spokespeople including Tom Brady, Stephen Curry, and Larry David. The effort turbocharged its name recognition outside traditional crypto circles, says Kevin Werbach, a Wharton business professor who appeared alongside Bankman-Fried at a congressional hearing. \"The FTX logo was extraordinarily visible around the world,\" Werbach says, \"even to many people who were not holders of digital assets.\"\n\nWooing Washington was an all-fronts war, and Bankman-Fried proved to be a master at waging it. Through his high-profile efforts, he forged a reputation as a crypto genius that made him impossible to ignore in Washington. One of his advisors put it in terms favored by the venture capitalists who were enthusiastically backing FTX: \"He just wanted to build this flywheel of domination.\"\n\nBy December 2021, Bankman-Fried had laid the groundwork for an appearance at a congressional hearing on regulating the cryptocurrency industry. Swapping his standard outfit of shorts and a T-shirt for a suit, he sat through questioning before the House Financial Services Committee, bolstering his reputation as the friendly and reasonable face of crypto. Hours later, he was back to his familiar antics on Twitter, where he jested with his die-hard followers about how he had failed to tie his shoelaces properly and how badly he had needed to pee during his testimony.\n\nThe following March, Bankman-Fried again visited Gensler at the SEC, flanked by Wetjen, Harrison, and Miller. This time he was also accompanied by Brad Katsuyama and other executives from the IEX exchange, who were considered white knights in the world of high-frequency trading. The meeting didn't go much better than the first one. Before the FTX executives got to the meat of their presentation Gensler interrupted them and went on a lengthy sermon about how he favored a more stringent regulatory approach. The SEC, at least, wasn't buying what Bankman-Fried was selling.\n\nBut Bankman-Fried's political giving and philanthropic endeavors earned him an audience at a far more influential institution: the White House. In May, CoinDesk reported, Bankman-Fried met with Charlotte Butash, a policy advisor to Biden's deputy chief of staff, and Steven Ricchetti, a counselor to the president. He was accompanied by Wetjen and Eliora Katz, recently hired as FTX's first in-house lobbyist. In just two short years, Bankman-Fried had gone from a little-known trader in a new industry to having the ear of the president's inner circle.\n\nSBF met twice with Gary Gensler, chair of the SEC \u2014 but Gensler rebuffed the CEO's regulatory proposals as insufficiently stringent. Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nRebuffed by the SEC, Bankman-Fried turned his attention to Congress. Over the summer, according to a senior crypto policy official, Bankman-Fried met with lawmakers privately almost every other week to argue for passage of the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act, a bill that would give the CFTC a key role in overseeing the crypto industry. He even suggested that the crypto industry might chip in to give the understaffed commission the resources it needed to implement the DCCPA, raising concerns about conflicts of interest.\n\nOthers in the sector opposed the measure, saying it was designed to favor FTX's interests over those of its rivals. Many critics cited concerns that it might hurt \"DeFi\" \u2014 decentralized finance projects that compete with exchanges like FTX. \"It's not that he was welcoming regulation,\" says the senior figure in the crypto industry who attended meetings with Bankman-Fried. \"It was that he was welcoming terrible, self-interested regulation that would have disadvantaged a lot of other companies.\"\n\nBut while Bankman-Fried was busy wooing Washington, FTX was about to become Exhibit A in the case for more effective oversight of the crypto industry. As the company proceeds through bankruptcy, legal filings paint a grim picture of FTX's inability to control even the most fundamental aspects of its business. The company failed to keep track of what assets it held, or even whom it employed. James Bromley, a lawyer for the company, said in court that FTX was \"run effectively as a personal fiefdom of Sam Bankman-Fried.\" The man many Washington regulators and lawmakers viewed as crypto's foremost expert is now under investigation by some of the same agencies and committees as crypto's biggest con man.\n\nBankman-Fried was hardly the first CEO to try his hand at the tricky business of cultivating political power. But what surprised veteran observers was the skill and determination with which he went about it \u2014 and how swiftly he succeeded. \"A lot of this is the playbook,\" says Niki Christoff, a political consultant in Washington. \"But it was done at sort of an accelerated speed \u2014 and in a way that was a little kludgy.\"\n\nAs any Silicon Valley engineer knows, a little kludginess is the price you pay for speed. What matters, in the early going, is producing a minimally viable product. And in the wake of Bankman-Fried's spectacular downfall, there are signs he may have accomplished something enduring. While the legislation he helped to bring into being, the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act, is given almost no chance of passing this year, some on Capitol Hill continue to support it, even in the wake of FTX's spectacular collapse. Rostin Behnam, who backed the measure as chair of the CFTC, told Congress last week that lawmakers should simply \"pause and look at the bill and make sure there are no gaps or no holes.\" And the bill's sponsors \u2014 Sens. Debbie Stabenow and John Boozman \u2014 intend to continue pushing for it.\n\nThis year, according to federal election records, Stabenow and Boozman received $32,400 in campaign contributions from none other than Sam Bankman-Fried.", "label": "human"}

In a tweet, Garcia, who describes himself as a comic book nerd in his Twitter bio, acknowledged it was for him.

It was the same phrase used at the funeral of Pope John Paul II in 2005, although by many more people then.\n\nWhile three of the last five popes have been made saints, only around a third of all pontiffs have been canonised in the Church's 2,000-year history.\n\nFrancis, who sat for most of the service because of a knee ailment, rose at the end as Benedict's coffin was being carried away. Holding himself up with a cane he touched it while bowing his head in silent prayer.\n\nAt 86, Francis, who has been using a wheelchair but has shown no signs of slowing down, with trips planned for Africa and Portugal in the coming months, is a year older now than Benedict was when he retired.\n\nFrancis himself has made clear that he would not hesitate to step down some day if his mental or physical health prevented him from carrying out his duties, but Vatican officials always doubted he could do this while Benedict was still alive.\n\nHOMILY\n\nThe service started about two hours earlier when, to the sound of tolling bells, 12 pallbearers carried the wooden coffin holding Benedict's remains out of St. Peter's Basilica and placed it on the ground before the largest church in Christendom.\n\nThe last time a reigning pope had presided over the funeral of a predessor was in 1802, when Pius VII led the service for Pius VI, whose body returned to the Vatican after he died in 1799 in exile.\n\nIn his homily read while sitting before the altar, Francis used more than a dozen biblical references and Church writings in which he appeared to compare Benedict to Jesus, including his last words before he died on the cross: \"Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.\"\n\nDuring the Mass concelebrated by 125 cardinals, 200 bishops and about 3,700 priests, Francis spoke of the \"wisdom, tenderness and devotion that he bestowed upon us over the years\".\n\nHe mentioned Benedict by name only once, in the last line, saying: \"Benedict, faithful friend of the Bridegroom,(Jesus) may your joy be complete as you hear his voice, now and forever!\"\n\nClergy from around the world, a handful of heads of state and thousands of faithful attended the ceremony as the sun slowly broke through the fog.\n\nMore than 1,000 Italian security personnel were called up to help safeguard the event, and air space around the tiny Holy See was closed off for the day. Italy ordered that flags around the country be flown at half staff.\n\nItalian police said about 50,000 people were in the square.\n\n'LEFT HIS MARK'\n\nPeople from all over the world, many from Benedict's native Germany, arrived in the early hours to say farewell to Benedict.\n\n\"Even though at our age we were just children when he was pope, he left his mark,\" Xavier Mora, 24, a Spaniard who is studying for the priesthood in Rome, told Reuters as he approached the square with two other seminarians.\n\n\"We have been studying his theology for three years and even though we did not know him personally we have great affection and esteem for him,\" he said.\n\nAbout 200,000 people filed past Benedict's body while it was lying-in-state for three days until Wednesday evening.\n\nAn account of Benedict's papacy, along with other items, including Vatican coins minted during his reign, was also tucked into the coffin. The account, written in Latin, says he \"fought with firmness\" against sexual abuse by clergy in the Church.\n\nWhile many leading figures have praised Benedict since his death, criticism has also been aired, including by victims of clergy sexual abuse, who have accused him of seeking to protect the Church at all costs.\n\nEven though Benedict largely avoided public appearances in subsequent years, he remained a standard-bearer for Catholic conservatives, who felt alienated by reforms ushered in by Francis, including cracking down on the old Latin Mass.\n\nAfter the funeral ceremony, the coffin was taken back inside the basilica to be encased in zinc before being sealed in a second wooden casket.\n\nAt his request, Benedict will be buried later on Thursday in the underground Vatican grottoes in the niche where first Pope John XXIII and then John Paul II were interred before their remains were transferred to more prominent places in the basilica above.\n\nWriting by Philip Pullella and Crispian Balmer; Editing by Mark Heinrich, Muralikumar Anantharaman and Alison Williams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "label": "human"}

Watching Lily Collins\u2019 divisive Emily Cooper step out in an acid-green Miu Miu coat in the show\u2019s third and latest season, I found myself struggling not to be swept up in the sheer joy of her devil-may-care wardrobe. A mishmash of clashing houndstooth, vibrant florals, neon gingham, light-catching sequins, and towering platform heels, her closet is as bottomless as her all-American energy. Emily Cooper\u2019s style is forever toeing the line between luxury and kitsch, which is precisely where costume designer Marylin Fitoussi likes to play.\n\nSourcing nearly 40,000 pieces for this particularly fashion-packed season, Fitoussi\u2014now the solo designer for Emily in Paris season 3, after collaborating with Patricia Field in seasons 1 and 2\u2014is never not collecting unexpected pieces for Collins to slip into. She sources luxury pieces, like the aforementioned Miu Miu coat and one particular Balmain fringe suit, from websites, individual collectors, and vintage stores like \u00d4dette Curated Vintage in Bordeaux and goodJo Paris. \u201cYou never have the right bags or the right shoe color,\u201d she says. \u201cIt sounds crazy. We had, like, 500 bags and\u2014it\u2019s not the perfect red; it\u2019s not the perfect shoe. It\u2019s always like that. It\u2019s desperate sometimes, but it\u2019s my passion.\u201d\n\nNever mind that Emily, an aspiring marketing executive, likely couldn\u2019t afford Dolce & Gabbana tops, Jean Paul Gaultier jackets, or Giambattista Valli gowns. Fitoussi couldn\u2019t possibly care less. (As she revealed in Netflix press materials, \u201cThe main lessons I learned from Patricia was her \u2018we don't care about reality\u2019 motto, which gave me great freedom regarding tone and spirit. I let go completely.\u201d)\n\nMore From ELLE\n\nThis season alone, Fitoussi says Collins wears 43 different looks over 10 episodes. Only a teeny handful of them feature exclusively what Fitoussi refers to as the \u201cFrench national colors\u201d: navy, black, and white. The rest are a kaleidoscope of magentas and turquoises and rust oranges and banana yellows, a break from Parisian reality Fitoussi is all too thrilled to take. \u201cIn Paris, if you take the metro in the morning, everybody\u2019s totally in black,\u201d she says. \u201cIt looks like a church. And people say to me, \u2018Oh, for once I\u2019ve discovered how good it feels to be dressed in color.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe takes a particular pride in the controversy Emily\u2019s closet choices have stirred up amongst both fashion and television fans. \u201cI'm happy that people hate the show,\u201d she says, smiling, \u201cbecause that means my duty, it\u2019s done. My mission is done. That means that what we can see on screen, it\u2019s strong, it\u2019s bold, it\u2019s not regular or ordinary.\u201d\n\nAnd she knows exactly why, contrary to all our educated instincts, Emily in Paris\u2019 costumes continue to inspire even monochrome-addicted cynics like myself: It\u2019s fun. So if you long to shop and dress like Emily circa season 3, Fitoussi has plenty of tips\u2014as do we, all of which you\u2019ll find below\u2014but remember one thing above all. \u201cIn Paris, they call me the parrot; they call me the clown because I'm dressed in color,\u201d Fitoussi says. \u201cDon\u2019t care. You need to be unique and you need to be yourself. So play with clothes.\u201d\n\nAhead, you\u2019ll discover some of Emily\u2019s best looks this season, as well as ideas for where you can find either the exact items, similar dupes, or in-the-same-vein alternatives.\n\nLook 1\n\nSt\u00e9phanie Branchu/Netflix\n\nChic knits are indeed a Parisian staple, but trust Emily to shred the rulebook with iridescent shorts and lime-green knee-high boots from Maison Skorpios. The resulting silhouette is as good a guidepost as any when it comes to styling a l\u00e1 Emily: Find mixed patterns and textures that share a color family, then layer them on with glee. And never neglect a high heel. Says Ashley Park, who plays Emily\u2019s roommate Mindy, \u201cMarilyn really found like this rhythm of, like, not just putting on an outfit, but really making a look out of everything.\u201d\n\nLook 2\n\nSt\u00e9phanie Branchu/Netflix\n\nEarly in season 3, Emily dons a gorgeous Paco Rabanne silver-and-violet high-neck sequin gown. You won\u2019t find the exact piece available online today, but a sequin dress is one of the relatively few modern trends Emily indulges in this season, so there are plenty of sparkly alternatives to be found if you\u2019re coveting the style. Just don\u2019t forget to pair with some sort of color.\n\nLook 3\n\nSt\u00e9phanie Branchu/Netflix\n\nEmily bares some midriff with this classic look, in which she pairs a Barbara Bui sequin blazer from the designer\u2019s Pre-Fall 2017 collection with a check-print bandeau from lingerie label LIVY. That exact bandeau will be available until Emily in Paris fans snap up all the stock, but other options include gingham crop tops or\u2014if you\u2019re bold enough\u2014bikini tops.\n\nLook 4\n\nNetflix\n\nIt\u2019s almost difficult to believe Emily is bummed during the scenes in which she wears this gorgeous Mira Mikati pastel blazer. The resulting look is so joyful it feels counterintuitive to watch our protagonist struggle with indecision. But perhaps that\u2019s the real idea behind Fitoussi\u2019s clashing patterns in this look: \u201cCooper,\u201d as her boyfriend Alfie calls her, is caught between two worlds.\n\nLook 5\n\nNetflix\n\nCollins herself is partial to this Dolce & Gabbana look, which, she tells ELLE.com, \u201clooks kind of like a zebra and an elephant combined with the little micro shorts.\u201d Emily styles them with a set of eye-popping Louboutin platforms, which were mere prototypes at the time Collins wore them. \u201cI just loved the combination of those things amongst the neon of Pierre Cadault.\u201d\n\nThe D&G top isn\u2019t available to shop online, but you can evoke the same aesthetic with a zebra-print jacket, tiny black shorts, a pair of transparent black tights, and some gleaming silver heels. (Or you can opt for the actual Louboutins, if you\u2019ve got some cash to burn.)\n\nLook 6\n\nNetflix\n\nOn a trip to Provence midway through season 3, Emily matches the picturesque skies in this light blue polka-dot midi with a torso cut-out. The billowy long sleeves add an extra layer of romanticism as she dines with will-they, won\u2019t-they love interest Gabriel, one of the few characters not constantly outfitted in neon. You\u2019ll find a few similar dress options below to test-run on your next date night, plus a few Emily in Paris-inspired accessories\u2014including a Pierre Cadault-branded tote ideal for your next European vacation.\n\nLook 7\n\nNetflix\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring an event with Maison Lavaux and McLaren, Emily dons this Giuseppedi Morabito mini with a voluminous lavender jacket to welcome guests to the party. Fitoussi\u2019s had the dress sitting around since season 1, but she says she could never find the right pieces to pair it with. Finally, ahead of season 3, she stumbled upon the ideal flounced jacket from Iris Apfel\u2019s collaboration with H&M, released earlier this year. It\u2019s the perfect example of Fitoussi\u2019s mentality: Luxury fashion can go with budget buys, so long as you know how to mix them.\n\n\u201cTry to see beauty everywhere because every piece can be interesting,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd sometimes you don\u2019t know at the moment how are you going to style it, but keep it.\u201d\n\nLook 8\n\nNetflix\n\nFor Emily Cooper\u2019s idea of athleisure, abandon your LuLuLemon and look no further than this anorak-and-turtleneck combo courtesy of La DoubleJ. The striking cherry pattern might not be anything particularly outrageous for Emily\u2019s wardrobe, but at your local gym, the look is certain to spark a few double-takes. Better yet, pair the top and jacket with joggers for your next airport excursion\u2014and make sure you pack season 2\u2019s infamous Pierre Cadault suitcase.\n\nLook 9\n\nNetflix\n\nSays Fitoussi, some of the season\u2019s best looks\u2014including this adorable sunflower-inspired get-up\u2014came to fruition through creative fusion with Collins. \u201cI can have a feeling if I get it wrong, or if she prefers that, or if she has also any suggestions,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m pleased that she\u2019s now able to say to me, \u2018I really feel comfortable, or I feel beautiful, or could we...?\u2019 [We] have this beautiful relationship now with no hard feelings; we can say, \u2018Okay, let\u2019s try this. What do you think?\u2019\u201d That artistic process led to this look, which combines a light-pink lace top with a yellow blazer, kerchief, lavender socks, and yellow gingham platforms. Is it practical? Of course not! C\u2019est la vie.\n\nLook 10\n\nNetflix\n\nYou might notice in season 3 that, in rare moments, Emily\u2019s allowed a true Parisian mentality to rub off on her wardrobe. She wears more neutrals\u2014though always in some sort of pattern\u2014and she\u2019s started to embrace more elegant French silhouettes, as you\u2019ll find with this wide-leg pants look.\n\n\u201cI think now it\u2019s time for her to embrace, a little bit, the French culture,\u201d Fitoussi says. \u201cShe decided to stay in Paris. She was observing the way Sylvie was dressing, the way of Camille was dressing. We can see that this love-hate game between both of them means that Sylvie is now taking some color of this young and a little bit arrogant young American ... and this young American girl is saying, \u2018Oh, the high-waisted trousers with the wide legs, that\u2019s so iconic about Sylvie\u2019s silhouette. [Can] I can take it and do it in my own style?\u2019\u201d", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Biotech has been a \"stock-pickers market\" \u2014 and it may have just what it takes to remain one in 2023, according to Citi. \"Biotech is currently a stock-pickers market, with focus on companies with near-term catalysts, active debates, and strong fundamentals that could continue to drive outperformance in various recession scenarios,\" Citi said in a December note. But performance within the sector will vary with the economy's. Under a bad recession scenario, Citi prefers names with large cash balances and which have already commercialized drugs, or which are on the verge of drug approvals. Some names that meet those criteria include Apellis Pharmaceuticals , Acadia Pharmaceuticals and Amylyx Pharmaceuticals , Citi said. The reverse would be the case in the event of a mild recession, as investors would be more willing to explore names with cheap valuations, according to Citi. It said, however, that even in such a scenario, \"more mature pipelines with good cash balances would not fall out of favor.\" \"In an intermediate base case landing scenario, we presume there may be some rotation to the safer names with longer cash runways, though we would still expect biotech investors to find the low market cap names with short cash runways as interesting high-risk opportunities,\" Citi added. Top picks for 2023 Citi named some top picks for the year ahead. 1. Beam Therapeutics The bank said its work in sickle cell disease has potential to produce a superior product. Its pre-clinical pipeline could also \"drive long-term value across a number of large market opportunities.\" \"[Its] strong cash position makes BEAM attractive even in a hard-landing scenario,\" Citi said. It gave the stock a target price of $62, or nearly 69% upside. 2. Apellis Pharmaceuticals Citi said Apellis needs to capture only a \"modest\" market share to achieve about $2 billion in peak sales, based on the bank's model. It gave the stock a target price of $86, or about 73% upside. 3. Karuna Therapeutics Karuna has many opportunities to expand its late-stage work on schizophrenia, which could drive $4 billion in peak sales if successful, Citi said. \"Further, in a hard landing/recession scenario, interest from long-only investors and generalists could persist as derisked names with near-term revenue opportunities are favored,\" the bank said. It gave the stock a target price of $279, or 45% upside.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The year 2022 has been a pivotal moment for the climate movement, marked by significant policy changes, growing public awareness, and tangible progress in the fight against climate change. Despite the challenges, there have been notable achievements that warrant recognition as the year comes to a close.\n\n1) Re-entry into the Paris Climate Agreement\n\nThe United States rejoined the Paris Agreement in 2021, recommitting to the global effort to limit global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius or below. This milestone marked a major comeback for the U.S., which was initially a leader in the agreement under the Obama administration but withdrew under the Trump administration.\n\n2) Corporate Sustainability Efforts\n\nCompanies worldwide have been ramping up their commitment to sustainability, pledging to reduce their carbon footprint, invest in renewable energy, and improve their environmental stewardship. Notable commitments made this year include Amazon's $2 billion Climate Pledge, Walmart and Apple's pledge to reach carbon neutrality by 2030, and Nestle's goal to become net zero by 2050.\n\n3) Sustainable Transportation Options\n\nAs awareness of transportation's environmental impact grows, businesses and policymakers are working to make transport more sustainable. The Biden Administration has prioritized electric vehicles in its climate plan, while China has invested heavily in the electric vehicle market. This year, Tesla unveiled its first electric pickup truck, and many automakers are investing in electric and hybrid options. Countries are also investing in public transportation systems, such as high-speed rail, to reduce emissions.\n\n4) Record Renewable Energy Investment\n\nGlobal investment in renewable energy hit record levels this year, surpassing investment in fossil fuels for the first time. This shift was driven by falling costs for renewable energy and increasing efforts to decarbonize the electricity sector.\n\n5) Climate Education Initiatives\n\nClimate education has become a growing priority, driven in part by the increasing awareness of the climate crisis. Many countries, including the United Kingdom, France, and Canada, have implemented initiatives to better educate the public about the climate crisis and its impacts.\n\n6) Carbon Pricing Advancements\n\nCarbon pricing has emerged as a key strategy for reducing emissions and incentivizing companies and individuals to shift away from fossil fuels. This year saw significant advancements in carbon pricing, with several countries implementing or expanding their existing programs. In the U.S., regional cap-and-trade systems were established to curb emissions, while in Canada, the federal government launched its carbon pricing plan.\n\nWhile these achievements are a step in the right direction, it's essential to recognize that much more needs to be done to reach net zero emissions and address the climate crisis. The actions taken this year represent a good start, but sustained effort and commitment are necessary to make progress toward a more sustainable future.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The synergy between Tom Brady and Mike Evans was on full display as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers secured the NFC South title with a 46-23 victory over the Carolina Panthers. Brady's 399 passing yards and four touchdowns, with three going to Evans, led the charge in the dramatic fourth-quarter comeback.\n\nThe Bucs' 10-5 record made them the first team to reach 10 wins this season and secured a postseason spot. Brady's 13th division title and 30th fourth-quarter comeback win further cemented his legendary status. The game seemed lost for the Bucs at the start of the fourth quarter, trailing 23-19, but Brady orchestrated a 23-point rally.\n\nBrady connected with tight end Cameron Brate for a 13-yard touchdown, followed by a three-and-out that set up his second touchdown to Evans, a 35-yard score. The duo's third connection, an 18-yard score, gave the Bucs their first lead of the game. The Bucs added two more touchdowns, one from Chris Godwin and another from Ke'Shawn Vaughn, to extend the lead to 46-23.\n\nEvans' 13 receptions for 232 yards and three touchdowns showcased his brilliance, tying an NFL record for most games with three-plus receiving touchdowns. The Buccaneers' defense also shone, forcing two turnovers and stopping the Panthers' comeback attempt.\n\nThe victory marked the sixth time the Bucs have won the NFC South since 2002, with Brady at the helm for four of them. The win also made Brady the first quarterback to win a division title with three different teams. The Bucs' statement win demonstrated their legitimacy as a Super Bowl contender, with their offense firing on all cylinders and defense playing at a high level, setting them up for a deep playoff run.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "As part of its product push during CES 2023, HP has revealed a ChromeOS counterpart to its premium Dragonfly Pro laptop. The Dragonfly Pro Chromebook is a professional-grade portable for business execs and digital content creators who are deep into Google's online ecosystem. It's also the first mainstream Chromebook with a gaming-laptop-style RGB-backlit keyboard.\n\nDetailing the Dragonfly Pro Chromebook\n\nHP hasn't yet shared the price of the Dragonfly Pro Chromebook, but it's clearly a high-end model that HP says is aimed at freelance or contract professionals. The chassis, crafted from recycled magnesium and aluminum and available in white or black, holds a 12th Generation Intel Core i5-1235U processor (two Performance cores, eight Efficient cores, 12 threads) with integrated graphics. Backing up the 15-watt CPU are 16GB of memory and a 256GB NVMe solid-state drive.\n\n(Credit: HP)\n\nDescribing the Chromebook's ports doesn't take long, because all you'll find are four USB4 Type-C ports with Thunderbolt 4 support, with two on either side of the laptop. These will do all heavy lifting in terms of accessory support and charging, though you may need a few adapters to get by (notably a USB-C DisplayPort dongle for an external monitor). Up-to-date wireless connectivity includes Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2. HP says the Dragonfly Pro Chromebook boasts an 8-megapixel webcam that should make it a star for video meetings.\n\nThe company also boasts that the laptop's 14-inch IPS touch screen is the brightest yet seen on a Chromebook, delivering up to 1,200 nits of luminance and showing 100% of the sRGB color gamut. The display provides 2,560-by-1,600-pixel resolution.\n\nThe First RGB Backlit Keyboard on a Mainstream Chromebook\n\nHowever, there's something about the Dragonfly Pro's keyboard that makes us love the screen even more: its RGB backlighting tuned to the primary screen color. Recent gaming Chromebooks from Acer, Asus, and Lenovo were the first to feature RGB keyboards, but the HP is the first mainstream or productivity-focused Chromebook to have one.\n\nWe can't speak to the keyboard's typing feel or the unit's overall build quality, because the system we saw at a pre-CES demo was a pre-production unit. But it did flaunt the kicky feature codeveloped by HP and Google: the keys' backlighting syncs to the hue of the background wallpaper, glowing green, for example, if the desktop shows a mostly green image.\n\n(Credit: HP)\n\nAI-powered RGB backlighting doesn't exactly count as a revolutionary boost in productivity, but it's certainly fun to have and a trend we'd love to see take hold. More RGB for everyone!\n\nThe Dragonfly Pro Chromebook experience is sustained by all-day battery life\u2014HP estimates its unplugged runtime at around 11 and a half hours. If you're a contract professional and spend your day in Google Workspace, you should safely get through a full workday plus an evening of streaming entertainment. Like the Windows Dragonfly Pro, the ChromeOS model supports HP's fast charging, promising to go from an empty battery to 50% capacity in just half an hour. It sounds like it's going to be hard to run out of battery life with this Chromebook, but we'll be the judge of that when we get a production unit in hand.\n\nImpressive and Flashy, But Will It Serve a Need?\n\nWe're impressed by our first look at the HP Dragonfly Pro Chromebook; it's a handsome system with cutting-edge connectivity, plenty of performance, a superior screen, and a cute keyboard gimmick. Admittedly, we're not sure how many freelance and contract professionals have joined the growing number of corporate IT managers choosing Chromebooks for business, especially at what's likely to be a premium price, but stay tuned for our full review this spring.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Web hosting may be the internet's most underappreciated element. Everything you love about being online\u2014podcasts, memes, articles, tweets, websites, online gaming, Netflix content\u2014lives on a server that an individual or company pays to keep up and running so that you can access it. In short, web hosting is an invisible, essential element of the online experience.\n\nIf you're considering, say, launching a website, there are several basic web hosting aspects that you should be familiar with before starting the project. Although it's relatively easy to sign up and use a provider's supplied website-building software to swiftly create an attractive, functional front end, there are a lot of related terms and concepts to wrap your head around. As you'll soon see, some of it is confusing, if not outright contradictory. Here's what you need to know about web hosting before opening an account.\n\n1. There's a Big Difference Between Hosting Types\n\nIf you've spent any amount of time on a web host's website, you've probably seen terms like shared, VPS, dedicated, cloud, WordPress, and reseller. They represent the different web hosting types, but not every web host offers them all. Plus, the hosting types differ from one another in significant ways.\n\nNearly every web host offers shared hosting, the cheapest form of web hosting. With shared hosting, your website shares a server and server resources with many other sites. If you want to keep your web hosting budget small, and don't expect much traffic, shared hosting is the way to go. You should expect to pay less than $10 per month for this web hosting type. This level of hosting is really best suited for small sites that don't need a huge amount of bandwidth, however. Since you're sharing resources with other sites, you should be prepared for the occasional slowdown should one of your site-mates start attracting a lot of visitors. Free web hosting is available if you're on a tight budget, but it comes with its own caveats (typically ads and extremely low server specs).\n\nLarger businesses that expect big traffic to their sites should pick VPS or dedicated hosting, each of which offers increasingly powerful server specs. VPS hosting is like a high-powered version of shared hosting, except that far fewer websites share a server's resources, which are also a bit more segregated. VPS hosting costs more than shared hosting, but you should pay less than $100 per month.\n\nDedicated hosting places your site on a server all by itself, so it can leverage a server's full power. This is the most expensive type of hosting; you may end up paying $100 per month or more for this raw power.\n\nReseller hosting lets you start your own branded web hosting business without worrying about building the infrastructure from scratch. WordPress hosting lets you build a site in an environment that caters to the world's most popular content management system. And cloud hosting? That's an entirely different beast that lets you easily scale website power across multiple servers, though not every web host offers it. Yet. The pricing for these hosting tiers are all over the place, so shopping around is vital.\n\nCheck out our various explainer articles (linked to in the paragraphs above) for a deeper dive into each hosting type.\n\n2. Bandwidth Isn't the Same as Data Transfer\n\n\"Bandwidth\" and \"data transfer\" are frequently used interchangeably to define the amount of data that your website serves to visitors, but the terms, technically, do not have the same definitions.\n\nBandwidth represents the total amount of data that can be transferred at one time, while data transfer is the throughput or the actual amount of information that can be used over a given period of time\u2014typically a month. Think of it like this: a web host may have a maximum 5GB bandwidth, but depending on your hosting plan, your site may only allow 1GB of data transfers per month.\n\nNote: If your website exceeds its allotted monthly data transfers due to a Reddit hit, for instance, a web host may slow your site's data transfer speeds or charge you a fee as a penalty. It may even prompt you to upgrade to a higher web hosting tier. It's good to know your site's data limitations before you run into situations like this.\n\n3. Unlimited Isn't Quite Unlimited\n\nWeb hosts will entice you to sign up for their web hosting plans by tempting you with the promise of unlimited storage or monthly data transfers. It's generally not a completely honest deal. Now, I won't say that these web hosts are straight up lying, but the \"unlimited\" storage or data transfers boasts nearly always have limitations that vary by company. FatCow, for example, offers \"oodles\" of disk space, and states that there's no cap on a user's content\u2014as long as that person remains fully compliant with the company's terms of service and utilizes storage \"for the normal operation of your FatCow website.\" It's just like the bottomless shrimp buffet: Eventually a restaurant will cut you off, if they don't simply run out of shrimp first.\n\nUnlimited storage and data transfers are typically associated with shared or WordPress plans, and they let you run wild\u2026within limits. If your blog gets a steady stream of reasonable traffic (whatever that may mean!), you'll be in good standing. However, you shouldn't expect to upload or stream 50TB of data per day. The average joe isn't doing that is likely dabbling in some questionable activities.\n\nYou should consult a web host's terms of service, or a customer service representative, to learn exactly what you can and cannot do within the scope of your plan's unlimited offering. For example, DreamHost states on its website that the company doesn't track \"bandwidth or traffic, so you never have to worry about pesky overage fees.\"\n\n4. The Hard Disk Drive/Solid-State Drive Tradeoff\n\nIf you're looking to sign up for shared web hosting, you'll likely receive real estate on traditional hard disk Drive (HDD) server. The advantage of an HDD-based server is that it can offer large storage amounts on the cheap. As you move up the hosting ladder to more powerful offerings, such as VPS and dedicated, web hosts will give you the option to build a site on a solid-state drive (SSD).\n\nSSD-based servers are lightning-fast storage units. SSD technology is still pretty pricey, so your SSD-based servers typically carry much smaller storage totals than HDDs. You'll rarely see 1TB SSD servers, which is a number that's commonplace in the HDD arena.\n\nThe SSD vs. HDD discussion is a lengthy one that goes well beyond the scope of this article. I recommend reading Tom Brant's excellent SSD vs HDD: What's the Difference?\n\n5. A Linux Server Will Do...Most of the Time\n\nNearly every web host offers Linux as the operating system that powers their servers. In fact, I don't think I've reviewed a web host that lacked the free, open-source OS. Even if you aren't familiar with Linux, you don't need to do any special work on the back end to build a website. Website builders make building sites a breeze.\n\nThat said, if your site needs the ASP or ASP.NET scripting frameworks, you'll need to run with the Windows Server operating system. That's because the script your write and webpages your produce will only function in a Windows-based environment.\n\n5 Things You Need to Know About Web Hosting 5 Things You Need to Know About Web Hosting\n\nThere's an additional benefit: Microsoft apps, such as Office or Outlook, integrate with the server with ease. The downside? Windows servers are incompatible with Linux-based, open-source software unless you do some tinkering. In addition, Windows servers cost approximately $10 to $20 more than their Linux equivalents, but if you need Microsoft's tools it's a small premium. Linux vs. Windows: How to Pick the Best Server OS for Your Website breaks down everything you need to know about these operating systems.\n\nFor more web hosting tips, check out The Best Courses for Learning How To Build Websites and 10 Easy But Powerful SEO Tips to Boost Traffic to Your Website.", "label": "human"}

We will deliver the bag to you, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\nPerhaps it was the response from the United customer service representative that enraged Twitter users the most, as many people pointed out the audacity in telling Szybala to \u201ccalm down\u201d.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe \u2018calm down\u2019 would have had me seeing red,\u201d replied one Twitter user.\n\n\u201cThis is wild,\u201d said someone else, before mentioning how they saw \u201crows and rows and rows\u201d of luggage at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey. \u201cA total mess\u201d.\n\nAnother person said: \u201cThat condescending \u2018calm down\u2019 would have had me acting an absolute fool in the DMs.\u201d\n\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences.

The plot thickens,\u201d she said, before adding in a separate tweet, \u201cANOTHER MAJOR UPDATE: My luggage AirTag has left McDonalds and returned to the apartment complex where it is being held hostage!\u201d\n\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.\n\nOn Monday morning, her AirTag appeared to be moving once again only to return to the apartment with the dumpster. By Monday afternoon, Szybala\u2019s luggage was finally returned.\n\nTaking to the popular Twitter thread, Szybala explained how she tracked down her luggage by \u201ccreeping around the building\u2019s garage\u201d and hoping to get a signal from her AirTag. She then received a \u201csketchy\u201d text message from DCA Couriers United, which said: \u201cI\u2019m delivering the luggage missing from your flight with AA/UA. I want to apologise for the inconvenience that you\u2019ve had with your bag. Imma deliver it to you today.\u201d\n\nThe courier explained that \u201cthe bag was given to me under a different passenger and I delivered your [sic] in a different address and had to go back to that place and pick it up.\u201d\n\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.\n\nBecause the message didn\u2019t match what Szybala\u2019s AirTag tracking had shown, she decided to call the number. When the man who sent the message picked up the phone, he told Szybala that he was just around the corner and drove back to meet her near the apartment complex.\n\nDespite her luggage now being home safe and sound, Szybala was left with many confused questions and not a lot of answers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that this guy was telling the truth, I suspect he was not. Nothing I\u2019ve been told by this guy or @United explains why my bag spent three days in an apartment complex garage, with occasional shopping excursions. I\u2019d still like some answers,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nThe two empty bags Szybala had seen by the dumpster were also gone by later on Monday. However, a building resident told Szybala that the suitcases weren\u2019t picked up by trash collection, but rather brought back inside by someone in the building, which \u201cadds to the sketchy factor for sure,\u201d she said.\n\nThe past three days were a wild journey for Szybala\u2019s once-missing luggage, so she concluded her viral Twitter thread by sharing some of the lessons she learned ever since United Airlines lost her bag.\n\nAmong the three lessons learned was that using a tracking device in your luggage \u201ccan be a lifesaver,\u201d travellers should take photos or inventory of their belongings in case they need to file a reimbursement claim, and to \u201cnever choose delivery\u201d over the pickup option if their bag arrives on a later flight.\n\nThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.\n\nUnited Airlines has yet to publicly comment on the case of the missing luggage, beyond Szybala\u2019s initial interaction with United\u2019s customer support chat.\n\nIn the wake of a winter storm that cancelled thousands of flights during the busy holiday season, the number of delayed or lost bags skyrocketed in 2022 alone. Last July, more than six bags out of every 1,000 checked in by passengers were at least temporarily lost, according to data from the US Department of Transportation.\n\nMeanwhile, 1,842 complaints about lost luggage were logged that month, more than eight times the complaints received in July 2021.\n\nThe Independent has contacted United Airlines and Valerie Szybala for comment.", "label": "human"}

Read our review Read Our Review A looong arrow, pointing right\n\nChase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card: Best welcome bonus offer\n\nIf you want to parlay your home remodeling project into a big welcome bonus offer, consider the Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card. This card starts you off with 60,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening (worth $1,080 in travel, per Insider's points and miles valuations). You'll also earn:\n\n5x points on Lyft rides through March 2025\n\n5x points on all travel purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards\u00ae\n\n3x points on dining, including eligible delivery services, takeout, and dining out\n\n3x points on select streaming services\n\n3x points on online grocery purchases (excluding Target, Walmart, and wholesale clubs)\n\n2x points on other travel\n\n1 point per dollar on everything else\n\nYou'll be charged a $95 annual fee, but you can redeem your rewards in a ton of different ways. For example, you can use Chase points to book travel through Chase, transfer them to airline and hotel partners at a 1:1 ratio, redeem them for cash back or merchandise, or cash them in for gift cards from an array of popular retailers, dining establishments, and more.\n\nYou can even redeem your rewards for gift cards to places like Lowe's or Home Depot, where you can use them to buy more supplies for projects around the home.\n\nFactoring in the welcome bonus, here are the rewards you'd earn on three different types of home-improvement projects, based on the pricing from Remodeling Magazine's cost versus value study:\n\nAsphalt roof replacement ($31,535): 91,535 Chase points, worth an average of $1,647.63 in travel\n\n91,535 Chase points, worth an average of $1,647.63 in travel Vinyl siding replacement ($18,662): 78,662 Chase points, worth an average of $1,415.92 in travel\n\n78,662 Chase points, worth an average of $1,415.92 in travel Garage door replacement ($4,041): 64,041 Chase points, worth an average of $1,152.74 in travel\n\nReview: Chase Sapphire Preferred card review\n\nChase Freedom Flex\u2120 : Best for buying supplies from Target\n\nThe Chase Freedom Flex\u2120 earns Chase Ultimate Rewards\u00ae points, which you can redeem for cash back at a rate of 1 cent per point. You can also use them for gift cards, travel, merchandise, and more through the Chase Ultimate Rewards portal. And, if you also hold an annual fee-incurring Chase Ultimate Rewards card, such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card, you can transfer those points to valuable airline and hotel partners, receiving an average value of 1.8 cents per Chase point.\n\nThe Chase Freedom Flex\u2120 does not charge an annual fee and earns 5% cash back on up to $1,500 spent in quarterly bonus categories after activation (then 1%) and 1% back on all other purchases. You also start off with a welcome bonus of $200 after spending $500 on purchases in the first three months from account opening.\n\nThis quarter's Chase Freedom bonus categories (January through March 2023) include Target, which offers a wide range of home remodeling products and supplies. Here's what you could earn with this card by using it to finance your home renovation (including the welcome bonus) \u2014 and the value you'd get if transferring points to travel partners:\n\nAsphalt roof replacement ($31,535): 57,535 Chase points, worth an average of $1,035.63 in travel\n\n57,535 Chase points, worth an average of $1,035.63 in travel Vinyl siding replacement ($18,662): 44,662 Chase points, worth an average of $803.92 in travel\n\n44,662 Chase points, worth an average of $803.92 in travel Garage door replacement ($4,041): 30,041 Chase points, worth an average of $547.38 in travel\n\nAnother bonus? The Chase Freedom Flex\u2120 offers a 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for the first 15 months (then a 18.74% - 27.49% Variable APR), which is great if you need some time to pay off your home improvement expenses.\n\nReview: Chase Freedom Flex card review\n\nBank of America\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards Credit Card : Best home improvement category bonus\n\nFor a lucrative combo of a long intro APR, decent bonus, and strong rewards rate on home improvement purchases, the no-annual-fee Bank of America\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards Credit Card is a great choice. Along with a welcome bonus offer of $200 cash rewards bonus after you spend $1,000 on purchases within 90 days of account opening, cardholders can take advantage of a 0% intro APR on purchases for the first 18 billing cycles and for any balance transfers made within the first 60 days of account opening (then a 18.24% - 28.24% Variable APR).\n\nWhere the card really shines is its bonus categories. Cardholders earn 3% cash back in one category of their choice (from a list of six that includes home improvement/furnishings purchases), 2% back at grocery stores and wholesale clubs, and 1% back on all other purchases. The downside is that the 3% (choice category) and 2% (grocery/wholesale club) rates only apply to the first $2,500 in combined purchases per quarter (then 1% cash back).\n\nIf you choose home improvement/furnishings as your 3% category for the quarter, you could potentially earn 3% back on $2,500 in spending (total of $75).

{"text": "When Kehau Hall set up her Airbnb glamping tent in 2014, she didn't think twice about it being roughly 10 minutes away from volcanos. She's used to their unpredictability, having lived in Hawaii since age 2 \u2014 and says she isn't threatened by them. \"Years ago from my mom's house, I could actually see one of the volcanoes erupting,\" Hall, 28, tells CNBC Make It. \"From her back porch, you could see the lava glowing at nighttime. It's just something you become accustomed to.\" Like her mother's home, Hall's glamping tent is in the Glenwood neighborhood of Mountain View, Hawaii, about 12 miles from the heart of the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park \u2013 which has two active volcanoes. Her inspiration for creating an Airbnb site was simple, she says: She saw a photo of a glamping tent in a magazine and thought it would be a unique way for mainlanders to experience Hawaii. She spent less than $300 on the tent and roughly $8,000 on amenities like a kitchen, an outdoor shower and a king-sized mattress. Now the property, which Hall says requires about 10-15 hours of work per week, earns her $28,000 per year in revenue, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It. Those earnings represent a sliver of a highly competitive tourism industry: In 2019, visitor spending on all of Hawaii's islands amassed $17.75 billion, according to the Hawaii Tourism Authority. The main island, where Hall's tent is located, brought in $22.4 million daily, on average. Hall's tent, by comparison is modest: It costs visitors about $70 per night. But to her, it represents independence \u2014 and the money she earns helps her spend more time traveling.\n\nA good use of inheritance\n\nHall, whose father is Hawaiian, grew up on the property: The 90 acres of land, which have been passed down through her family for generations, host a handful of family homes as well as wild pigs, cows and chickens. Hall says she partially set up her tent to share the property's natural beauty more broadly.\n\nHall's tucked away glamping tent costs roughly $70 per night and is about 12 miles away from the heart of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Kehau Hall\n\n\"I wanted to use the land for good, where other people could come and benefit from it and really immerse themselves in nature,\" Hall says. \"Nowadays, everybody's working. Everybody's connected to electronics. It's important to detach and relax from the virtual world for a moment.\" She had industry experience, too. In high school, Hall helped out at local bed and breakfasts \u2013 which also used Airbnb \u2013 and worked with a realtor to manage local rental properties. For four years, she also worked for the nearby national park. At age 20, she decided to lean into her entrepreneurial instinct and listed her glamping tent on Airbnb. She says it took about six months and five positive reviews for the tent to gain traction.\n\nGradual growth\n\nSince then, glamping reservations have remained fairly consistent: Hall says she averages three bookings per week, and the average guest stays for two-four nights. Before Covid hit, Hall says, the job felt like a Hawaiian daydream. She worked 10-15 hours per week managing the bookings and cleaning the property herself after every stay. She spent 15 additional hours per week helping manage other guest stays in homes on her family's large property, bringing her another $20,000 per year. Then, in March 2020, Hawaii issued a mandatory 14-day quarantine for travelers to prevent the spread of Covid. Tourism \u2014 Hawaii's \"largest single source of private capital,\" according to the Hawaii Tourism Authority \u2014 immediately plummeted. Between the first and second quarter of 2020, the state's unemployment rate jumped from 2% to 20.1%, according to Hawaii's Department of Business, Economic Development & Tourism. Hall suffered the effects: She received zero bookings for about six months, during which mainland travelers weren't allowed to visit Hawaii without abiding by a 14-day quarantine. She got by on savings and started cleaning personal homes to make money. Over those six months, she says, she lost most of her sources for disposable income and barely left her home \u2014 only to work or grocery shop.\n\nThe price of Aloha\n\nBusiness at Hall's glamping site picked back up in early 2021: Guests booked month-long stays with expanded options for remote work. With a more consistent cash flow, Hall says she now blocks off four weeks of the year to travel to the mainland or abroad.\n\nHall's glamping tent comes equipped with a king-sized bed, coffee pot, outdoor shower and wifi.

One candidate, affiliated with a conservative party, has expressed strong support for deepening ties with this Asian nation, citing potential economic benefits.\n\nOn the other hand, the other candidate, representing a centre-left party, has criticized the current government's close relationship with this nation and advocates for strengthening ties with other regional countries, particularly a nearby nation, and investing in local infrastructure and education.\n\nBoth candidates have highlighted the importance of their relationship with this Asian nation during the election campaign, but it remains unclear which candidate the government of this nation will support.\n\nThe president of this nation has maintained a neutral stance, but some analysts believe that a decision may be made soon to prevent the issue from becoming a campaign talking point for the rival candidates.\n\nThis issue is significant for Paraguay, as it is one of the few countries in the region to recognize this nation as an independent country.

{"text": "The enigmatic symbiosis between Donald Trump and the Republican Party has persisted for over four years, entwining the two entities in a intricate dance of mutual dependence.\n\nDespite Trump's provocative rhetoric, he has maintained a firm grasp on the Republican Party, attracting the allegiance of prominent party leaders. The relationship between Trump and the Republican Party has been multifaceted, with some members criticizing his unorthodox style while others have been eager to support him.\n\nWhat drives Republican elites like Sen. Lindsey Graham, Sen. Mitch McConnell, and others to back Trump? A few key factors can be identified.\n\nInfluence\n\nThe most apparent reason for the Republican Party's support of Trump is that he has been an electoral asset for them. Since his election in 2016, Trump has maintained a loyal base of supporters, aiding the GOP in retaining control of the White House and both chambers of Congress.\n\nEven when signs of Trump's base shrinking emerged, Republican leaders have been reluctant to abandon him. During his impeachment in 2019, almost all Republicans in Congress voted to acquit him. Trump's strong base of support has granted him significant leverage, making it challenging for party elites to oppose him.\n\nThe influence of Trump's base has been evident in other ways as well. Following Sen. Mitt Romney's (R-UT) decision to vote to convict Trump during his impeachment trial, he faced intense pressure from the president's supporters. Trump's loyalists sent death threats, hurled insults, and called for Romney's censure by the Utah State Senate, demonstrating that those who defy Trump do so at their own peril.\n\nShared Values\n\nFor many Republican elites, supporting Trump has also been a means of expressing their shared values and beliefs. Trump has articulated a clear worldview that resonates deeply with many members of the Republican Party. From his hard-line stance on immigration to his commitment to deregulation, Trump has championed a set of conservative principles that have been embraced by many party members.\n\nThis shared ideology has allowed Republicans to remain unified in the face of opposition, with many leaders dismissing Trump's behavior as a sideshow. Even when he has uttered or done something considered to be beyond the bounds of normal political discourse, many Republican elites have found ways to downplay the issue and maintain party unity.\n\nElectoral Imperative\n\nThe Republican Party has also been driven by another dynamic\u2014the need to win elections. This has meant that party members have had to take into account the base's strong support for Trump. Despite his unpopularity among the broader electorate, Trump has been a popular figure among Republican voters, who see him as a successful president who is fighting for the issues that matter to them.\n\nThis electoral pressure has compelled Republican elites to make difficult decisions. While some have openly criticized Trump, others have done so quietly, worried that to oppose him openly could cost them votes. This need to win elections has motivated many Republican elites to remain loyal to Trump, despite his controversial rhetoric and actions.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor the past four years, the Republican Party has been grappling with the presence of Donald Trump in its ranks. Despite the divisiveness and chaos that Trump has brought to the party, many Republican elites have backed him, driven by a mix of influence, shared values, and electoral imperative. This complex relationship between the party and its leader is likely to persist for the foreseeable future.", "label": "machine"}

It employs around 100,000 people and serves as the primary production site for popular Apple products, including the iPhone 12 and 11.\n\nThis development is part of a larger trend, as Foxconn China continues to expand its production capabilities in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The Zhengzhou facility is the largest so far, and the Henan Province is planning to launch two additional Apple-related projects, along with the ongoing construction of another massive factory in the same region.\n\nMeeting the ever-growing demands of customers is crucial for Foxconn China, and the company is working to stay ahead of rivals like HiSilicon in terms of quality and efficiency. The Zhengzhou factory will play a vital role in propping up Apple's efforts to maintain its position in the smartphone market, particularly with the introduction of the iPhone 12 and 5G technology.\n\nFoxconn China's decision to open the Zhengzhou factory is a testament to the company's long-term commitment to Henan Province, having invested over $8 billion in the region over the past decade. This commitment has created a thriving economy and provided much-needed jobs and opportunities for the region.\n\nFoxconn's vision for the Zhengzhou factory includes automation and intelligent manufacturing, leveraging cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence and robotics to further increase its capacity. The complex is already equipped with advanced robotic technologies and automated production systems, which will dramatically improve efficiency and reduce manual labor requirements.\n\nThe Zhengzhou facility is the latest example of Foxconn China's dedication to producing the world's most advanced products by investing in the best technology and working closely with its customers. By doing so, Foxconn China ensures that Apple's products remain among the most sought-after globally.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The sudden shift in fortunes for Congressman Kevin McCarthy has led to his potential ascension to the position of Speaker of the House of Representatives, a role he has long coveted. This surprising turn of events has sparked controversy, given McCarthy's humble beginnings as a relatively unknown figure a decade ago. His rise to prominence can be attributed, in part, to his unwavering support for President Donald Trump and his impressive political acumen.\n\nMany, including some within his own party, have expressed skepticism about McCarthy's elevation, citing concerns that he lacks a clear ideology or governing philosophy. This perception is understandable, given his reputation for being a skilled tactician who prioritizes power over grand visions.\n\nHowever, it is also important to consider the possibility that McCarthy's detractors have a flawed understanding of both him and the role of the Speaker. The Speaker's primary responsibilities include organizing and leading the House, serving as its public face, and building relationships with various factions within the institution. This often requires compromise, deal-making, and creative problem-solving.\n\nWhile McCarthy's critics are not entirely wrong in their assessments, it is worth acknowledging that his political acumen and ability to work with diverse members of Congress might be precisely what makes him well-suited for the position.\n\nMoreover, McCarthy's detractors may be overlooking a crucial aspect: the lack of a viable alternative. The Republican Party is fractured, with different factions vying for power, making it unlikely that a single candidate can bridge the divides. Therefore, McCarthy's detractors should at least acknowledge his political savvy, even if they disagree with his approach.\n\nIt is clear that McCarthy's style of governance is contentious. However, his detractors should carefully consider what kind of alternative they desire and how to achieve it. Furthermore, it is evident that McCarthy has a chance to make history as the first Republican Speaker in nearly a decade, and it is up to his critics to develop a realistic theory of governance that can rival his own.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "In an era of unprecedented turmoil, our nation and the world have grown increasingly reliant on the expertise of scholars, particularly historians. With the rise of the public intellectual, popular culture has increasingly incorporated the views of historians to shape debates, inform discussions, and provide interpretations of the present and advice for the future. Historians have become invaluable to our understanding of the past and have gained significant respect as public figures.\n\nHowever, this new status quo comes with some potential pitfalls. Historians, perhaps more than any other profession, are prone to certain biases that can lead to flawed analysis, oversimplification, and apoliticism. Historians often rely too heavily on certain ideas and narratives, resulting in narrow perspectives that neglect important nuance and context. Here are five common phrases historians often use\u2014and ways to think more critically about the issues we all face.\n\n1. \u201cWe Can Draw Lessons from the Past\u201d\n\nThis phrase is often repeated, but it oversimplifies the complexity of history. While there is truth to it, history is multifaceted, with unexpected lessons and vivid examples. A more nuanced interpretation is that history can provide insight and perspective, but there is often no single \"right\" answer. Moreover, some moments in history are more relevant to contemporary concerns than others.\n\n2. \u201cThe Context Was Different\u201d\n\nThis phrase is often used to justify uncomfortable aspects of the past. For example, when discussing the legacy of slavery, some might say that slavery in the 19th century was a different institution than it is today. While the institution of slavery has evolved, the atrocities of the past remain relevant and severe today. The context of the past is secondary to the wrongs that were committed.\n\n3. \u201cThis Is Just the Way Things Are\u201d\n\nThis phrase downplays the significance of current events, suggesting that conflicts today are nothing new. While it's true that many issues have been around for centuries, it's essential to recognize that the ways in which these issues manifest themselves today can be quite different from the past. Moreover, not all issues have been around for centuries\u2014new problems have emerged in recent decades, with implications for our contemporary lives.\n\n4. \u201cThey Didn't Have the Same Information\u201d\n\nThis phrase is often used to deflect criticism of those who lived in the past and to avoid applying present standards to past behavior. While it's true that people in the past didn't have the same information, they did have some knowledge\u2014and there were certainly people in the past who could have had broader, more enlightened views. We should be cautious in our retrospective judgments, but there is no excuse for exonerating those who committed and enabled awful acts.\n\n5. \u201cHistory Is Inescapable\u201d\n\nThis phrase implies that events in the past are static, that they don't change or evolve over time. While it's true that some patterns in history have repeated over time, it's essential to recognize that history does not have to repeat itself\u2014it is possible for us to learn from our mistakes and shape the future. The best way to prevent history from repeating itself is to actively work to break these cycles and forge a new path forward.\n\nHistory is a valuable tool for understanding the present and the future, but it's easy to fall into the traps of oversimplification and apoliticism. The five phrases outlined above are just a few examples of how historians can struggle to provide meaningful insights into contemporary events. In this tumultuous time, our world desperately needs fresh analysis and ideas\u2014to find ways to break the patterns of the past and bring positive, meaningful change.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "The dawn of a new year brings with it a collective sigh of relief as many Americans bid adieu to the tumultuous 2020. Amidst the optimism, a peculiar phenomenon has emerged - a social media movement urging the \"exile\" of four prominent figures deemed to embody the worst aspects of the past year.\n\nA hashtag, #goodbyeoldhabits, has gained traction as people join forces to bid farewell to President Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Kanye West, and Johnny Depp. These individuals, according to their detractors, represent the antithesis of what 2021 should stand for.\n\nDonald Trump's presidency was marked by controversy, from environmental rollbacks to divisive rhetoric and Twitter tirades. While some praised his unwavering convictions, others saw them as a dangerous cocktail of white supremacy, xenophobia, and disregard for truth.\n\nElon Musk's SpaceX and Tesla ventures have pushed the boundaries of innovation, but his partnerships with governments perceived as problematic and his carbon-intensive businesses have raised eyebrows. The environmental implications of his endeavors have sparked concerns.\n\nKanye West's outspoken support for Trump and his own presidential ambitions have made him a pariah in some circles. His refusal to wear a mask during the pandemic and allegations of refusing to pay rent have further tarnished his image.\n\nJohnny Depp's high-profile legal battle with ex-wife Amber Heard over domestic abuse allegations has led many to call for his blacklisting.\n\nThe #goodbyeoldhabits hashtag has inspired a range of creative projects, from art to music and memes. One user shared a hypothetical illustration of the four being launched into outer space, accompanied by the hashtag.\n\nHowever, it remains unclear how much of an impact this sentiment will have. Trump is fighting his election loss and may continue to be a public figure for some time. Musk is well-funded and will likely continue to shape the tech and space exploration landscape. West and Depp enjoy enthusiastic fan bases, and their influence may persist.\n\nStill, some individuals seem determined to voice their disapproval and will be watching closely to see if these figures will take the hint.", "label": "machine"}

It said the park has seen an increase in people arriving by boat from Cuba.\n\n\"The closure, which is expected to last several days, is necessary for the safety of visitors and staff because of the resources and space needed to attend to the migrants,\" the NPS said.\n\nFirst responders at the park are providing food, water and basic medical needs until the Department of Homeland Security arrives, the statement noted. Concession-operated ferry and sea plane services are temporarily suspended.\n\nRear Adm. Brendan C. McPherson, director of Homeland Security Task Force - Southeast, said in a statement Sunday that the task force is aware of \"multiple migrant landings this weekend\" on the park.\n\n\"They will be removed, provided food, water & basic first aid before transfer to federal [law enforcement] agents in the Keys for processing by [Miami Sector U.S. Border Patrol] to determine their legal status to remain in the United States or be processed for removal and repatriation to their country of origin,\" McPherson said.\n\nA former Florida resident camping on the park over the weekend captured footage of some of the migrant landings. Migrants can be seen leaping off their makeshift chug boats, hugging each other, and cheering with joy after making it to land. He told NPR member station WGCU that the migrants' supplies included life vests and bags of crackers.\n\nAbout 70 miles west of Key West, Fla., the 100-square mile park consists of seven small islands accessible only by boat or seaplane.

You play as a man who dies and comes back to life to use his skills playing cards to help his horse win races. It sounds absurd and it is. But it\u2019s also brilliant, showing Game Freak knows its way around more than just iterating on Pok\u00e9mon sequels.\n\nApple announced the port to iOS, called Ride On!, on Tuesday, and while the gameplay will remain the same, the horse races themselves will now be portrayed in 3D.

That\u2019s not all. Certain cards also provide bonuses, improve performance, raise the horse\u2019s level, or grant it new skills. There\u2019s even horse breeding, because while cards are forever, a horse\u2019s life is not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt made Kotaku\u2019s 2016 list of \u201cweirdest 3DS games you may have missed\u201d with former Editor-in-Chief, Stephen Totilo, lauding the gameplay as both \u201cstrategic and shockingly deep.\u201d But why does it exist in the first place? Why would Game Freak, the studio continually pumping out new Pok\u00e9mon best-sellers, take time to ship a $7 micro-game?\n\nThe studio has an internal system called the \u201cGear Project\u201d where employees form teams and submit game projects. The approved ones then get greenlit for full development. Besides Pocket Card Jockey, games like HarmoKnight, Tembo The Badass Elephant, and Giga Wrecker were also born of this process. Game Freak programmer and director Masayuki Onoue previously said in an interview with VGC that it helped staff developer their experience around making original games and return to the Pok\u00e9mon series \u201crefreshed.\u201d\n\nG/O Media may get a commission 42% Off Hisense 58-Inch ULED LED 4K Smart TV TV time\n\nThis 58-inch smart TV has 4K visuals on a stunning ULED screen that boosts color, contrast, and brightness, has Fire TV built-in for convenience, and even includes Alexa.

Another card-based hybrid, it was a fun little tactical RPG with charming visuals and a soundtrack by Undertale\u2019s Toby Fox. Hopefully the current onslaught of Pok\u00e9mon games, and their clear need for more development time and polish, doesn\u2019t prevent Game Freak from continuing to experiment with weird one-off projects in the future.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "It's time to start treating handbags like a legitimate investment. In 2020, the investment potential of handbags outpaced rare artwork, cars and whiskey, according to Art Market Research. By 2027, the market is expected to reach $100 billion, compared to today's $72 billion. As the founder of Rebag, a designer handbag resale site, I've kept a close eye on the resale value of sought-after luxury goods. Based on our proprietary pricing tool, which uses millions of data points on primary and secondary market pricing and demand, here are six designer handbags that are actually worth the money \u2014 and the ones you may regret buying:\n\n1. Telfar bags\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Telfar Shopping Bag Photo: Rebag\n\nThanks to high demand, limited drops and celebrity fans like Dua Lipa, Oprah Winfrey and Beyonc\u00e9, Telfar bags have an average value retention of 195%, meaning that they appreciate to nearly twice as much as their original retail price. That's well above other major designer names \u2014 like Chanel, for example, which boasts an average value retention of 87%. Founded in 2005 by Telfar Clemens, any model of the Telfar Shopping Bag, especially the Ugg, Eastpak and Moose Knuckles collaborations, will earn at least its retail value at resale.\n\n2. Herm\u00e8s bags\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Herm\u00e8s Birkin Sellier Photo: Rebag\n\nLike Telfar, Herm\u00e8s is a designer \"unicorn.\" On average, the brand's products retain their initial retail value and are worth more on the resale market. The French luxury brand has an average value retention of 103%. The Birkin and Kelly bags \u2014 named after Jane Birkin and Grace Kelly \u2014 do especially well at resale because they are two of Herm\u00e8s' marquee items. Birkins have an average value retention of 96%, while the Kelly averages 108%. The rare Birkin Sellier has an especially high average value retention of 226%.\n\n3. Louis Vuitton bags\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Louis Vuitton x NBA Ball in Basket Bag Photo: Rebag\n\nAnother designer \"unicorn,\" Louis Vuitton boasts some impressive resale values, especially on their short-release styles. For example, the Nigo Keepall Bandouli\u00e8re bag has a 119% average value retention, while the Louis Vuitton x NBA Ball in Basket Bag has a 147% average value retention. The brand's average retention value at resale is 92%.\n\n4. Chanel bags\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Chanel Deauville Tote Photo: Rebag\n\nThe resale value of Chanel bags climbed with its primary market price increases. Up 12 percentage points from 2021, the brand's average value retention is 87%, although several bags exceed 100%. Chanel's Deauville Tote and Grand Shopping Tote are among the highest-value bags, retaining an average of 112% and 110%, respectively, of their values on the secondary market.\n\n5. Mini editions\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Louis Vuitton Mini Speedy Photo: Rebag\n\nMini editions are excellent investments because they are produced in smaller quantities and have high demand, often driving their secondary market values up. For example, the Louis Vuitton Speedy Mini HL Handbag retains 201% of its value at resale, while a vintage Fendi Micro Baguette keeps 149% of its retail value on the secondary market.\n\n6. Collaborations\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Dior Daniel Arsham Double Zip Crossbody Pouch Photo: Rebag\n\nCollaborations are excellent investments because they're limited editions that often sell out. The Balenciaga and Gucci Hacker Project tote has a 122% average value retention, while The Hacker Project camera bag holds 116% of its initial retail value at resale. Artist Daniel Arsham's Dior collaboration also performs well, with its double-zip crossbody pouch keeping 139% of its retail value on the secondary market.\n\nNot all designer handbags are good investments", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The economic landscape has been marked by turbulence in recent times, with growth rates slowing and unemployment figures rising. Nevertheless, certain market segments have demonstrated remarkable resilience, with the financials sector being one of the most notable examples.\n\nA recent analysis by Halftime Report reveals that the financials sector has been thriving despite the economic headwinds. In the first quarter of 2021, the sector recorded a 5.3% increase, outperforming the broader S&P 500 index, which experienced a 4.3% decline. Furthermore, the financials sector has been outperforming the broader S&P 500 index year-to-date, with a 6.2% gain compared to a 3.8% increase in the broader index.\n\nExperts attribute the financials sector's robustness to its extensive exposure to the US economy. The sector encompasses banking, insurance, and asset management industries, which have all demonstrated remarkable resilience in the face of economic uncertainty.\n\n\"The financials sector is uniquely positioned to benefit from a recovery in the US economy,\" stated Adam Sharp, a senior analyst at Halftime Report. \"The sector has deep exposure to various sectors of the economy, including banking, investment services, and real estate. This diversified exposure has enabled financials companies to remain resilient even in the face of a recession.\"\n\nThis news is particularly encouraging for investors, as the financials sector can provide a sense of stability in a volatile market. Moreover, with the Fed's current monetary policy stance, interest rates are likely to remain low, which can benefit financials companies that heavily rely on interest income.\n\n\"In addition to the sector's diversified exposure, low interest rates are also contributing to the boost in financials companies' profitability,\" said Sharp. \"The sector's profitability is likely to remain strong, even if economic growth remains slow.\"\n\nAnalysts are also optimistic about the sector due to its exposure to emerging markets. Many of the world's largest financials companies have substantial operations in emerging markets, which can benefit from improved economic conditions.\n\n\"The emerging markets are expected to experience strong growth over the next few years, and many financials companies are well-positioned to benefit from that growth,\" said Sharp. \"The sector's long-term prospects remain bright, despite the current economic uncertainty.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the financials sector appears poised to continue performing well in the near-term, despite the ongoing economic uncertainty. With its broad exposure to the US economy and long-term prospects, the sector looks set to remain a steady performer in the stock market, even in a recession.", "label": "machine"}

However, there are also uncertainties that could hinder the industry's progress, such as inflation, interest rates, supply chain disruptions, and potential decreased demand.\n\nThe industry has been severely impacted by the pandemic, with sales plummeting 16% in 2020 and only partially recovering in 2021. Nevertheless, analysts predict a modest increase in sales, ranging from 3% to 5%, which could help the industry recover some losses from the past two years.\n\nSeveral factors could propel the industry forward in 2023. The economy is expected to improve, boosting consumer confidence, while pent-up demand is likely to return as buyers become more comfortable with the idea of purchasing a new vehicle. Automakers are also expected to offer incentives to entice buyers into showrooms.\n\nThe leasing market could also play a significant role in the industry's recovery. Leasing activity dropped to a record low in 2020 but has been slowly increasing in recent months. This could help spur demand for new vehicles, benefiting the industry as a whole.\n\nWhile there are still challenges ahead, analysts believe there is reason to be optimistic about the industry's prospects in 2023. With signs of stabilization and potential positive factors on the horizon, the industry may be poised for a more robust recovery in the coming year.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "A group of former Twitter employees are taking legal action against the company, alleging that they were subjected to an \"inhumane and clumsy\" layoff process orchestrated by CEO Elon Musk. The lawsuit, which seeks class-action status, claims that Twitter violated federal and state law by failing to provide adequate notice to employees and by not negotiating with their collective bargaining representative.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Twitter's layoff process was designed to avoid public attention and that the company failed to notify employees in a timely and effective manner. The plaintiffs claim that they were not provided with necessary resources, guidance, or severance packages, and that they were even forbidden from discussing their terminations with anyone.\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that Twitter did not inform employees about their rights to health insurance benefits and outplacement services. The plaintiffs are seeking compensation for their lost wages and benefits, as well as a declaration that Twitter's layoff process was unlawful.\n\nIn response to the lawsuit, Twitter has said that it disagrees with the claims made by the former employees, but will continue to evaluate the case and respond as appropriate. The legal action comes amid mounting criticism of Musk's management style and the company's handling of layoffs.\n\nThe former employees are hoping that the lawsuit will set a precedent for how companies should conduct themselves during layoffs and that it will hold Twitter accountable for its actions. They believe that the lawsuit will send a message to other companies that they must treat their employees with respect and dignity, even during difficult times.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (C) is led away handcuffed by officers of the Royal Bahamas Police Force at the Nassau, Bahamas, courthouse on December 19, 2022.\n\n\"Following the serious allegations against FTX, Senate Majority PAC previously set aside the contribution amounts from Sam Bankman-Fried and Nishad Singh with the intention of returning the funds once we receive proper direction from federal law enforcement officials based on their legal proceedings,\" a PAC spokeswoman told CNBC on Tuesday.\n\nThe super PAC, which spent more than $160 million supporting Democratic bids for Senate seats, received $2 million from Singh and $1 million from Bankman-Fried during the 2022 election cycle, according to Federal Election Commission records.\n\nThe pro-Democratic Senate Majority PAC plans to return $3 million in donations from former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and the crypto exchange's ex-head of engineering, Nishad Singh, the group said Tuesday.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee and the party's Senate and House campaign arms \u2014 the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee \u2014 have made similar commitments to return donations from former FTX executives.\n\nBankman-Fried has contributed millions toward other PACs aligned with the Democratic Party, including to the House Majority PAC, Protect Our Future and Future Forward USA. The Bankman-Fried-founded hedge fund, Alameda Research, donated more than $5 million to Future Forward USA, which went on to spend millions backing Joe Biden's 2020 candidacy for president. Those PACs did not respond to requests to comment on whether they would return the contributions.\n\nBankman-Fried also donated $6 million in April to House Majority PAC, which raises money for Democratic candidates running for the lower chamber, according to an FEC filing. The PAC \"will send funds in question wherever authorities instruct us,\" spokesman CJ Warnke said after publication of this story.\n\nBankman-Fried contributed nearly $40 million in the midterms, and most of the money went to Democrats. Singh donated $8 million to federal campaigns during the 2022 midterms. The former FTX director of engineering has not been charged with any crimes.\n\nThe PAC is returning the donations after Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas and is facing charges by U.S. federal prosecutors, as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Prosecutors charged Bankman-Fried with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud, among other allegations.\n\nHe was also charged with violating campaign finance laws, including allegations that he gave at least $25,000 to campaigns and political action committees \"in the names of other persons.\"\n\nBankman-Fried diverted customer assets held by FTX, a major cryptocurrency exchange, to his separate crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research, the SEC said in its complaint. He then used those funds to make \"large political donations,\" to make investments, and buy \"lavish real estate,\" the SEC alleged.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The CEO of a digital token trading firm, Cameron Winklevoss, intensified his verbal sparring match with the head of a rival digital token firm, Michael Moro, accusing him of delaying the return of $900 million to his customers.\n\nThe feud between Winklevoss and Moro began last week, when Winklevoss accused Genesis of delaying the return of funds to customers who had invested in their digital token services. Genesis then responded by accusing Winklevoss of launching a \"smear campaign\" against their company.\n\nNow, Winklevoss is escalating the situation, accusing Moro of deliberately delaying the return of the funds, and of engaging in a \"deplorable\" act. In an open letter posted on Twitter, Winklevoss stated he was \"appalled\" at the way Moro had handled the situation.\n\n\"Your refusal to return nearly $900 million to your customers and provide a detailed explanation of why this was necessary, is deplorable and speaks to your true character,\" Winklevoss wrote. \"By refusing to do so, you are sending a clear message to investors everywhere that you simply do not care about their financial well-being.\"\n\nThe dispute between Winklevoss and Moro centers on the return of funds to customers who were left in limbo after Genesis shut down its trading platform last week due to a \"liquidity issue.\" The $900 million in customer funds was frozen when the company closed its doors, leaving many customers unable to access their funds.\n\nThe dispute has reignited a long-standing rivalry between Winklevoss and Moro, with the former accusing the latter of running a \"pump and dump\" scheme and the latter calling out the former for launching a \"smear campaign.\"\n\nWinklevoss, in his letter, stated he was willing to cooperate with Moro in resolving the issue, but only if Moro was willing to be \"transparent, honest, and forthcoming\" about the reasons for closing down the platform and what steps are being taken to ensure customers are not left out of pocket.\n\n\"I strongly urge you to stop making excuses and start taking responsibility for what has happened and for restoring the trust that has been lost,\" Winklevoss wrote.\n\nAt the time of writing, Moro had not responded to Winklevoss's letter. However, the escalating dispute has put the spotlight on the contentious relationship between the two men, and their companies' respective approaches to customer service.\n\nThe clash between Gemini and Genesis over the frozen funds could have significant repercussions for the industry, particularly if customers cannot receive the full amount of their investments back. This could lead to increased scrutiny from regulators, who have been closely monitoring the digital token sector for signs of fraud or abuse.\n\nThe dispute also highlights the often tense rivalry between Gemini and Genesis, which have been in a battle for market share since the two companies were established in 2020. Both firms have been accused of engaging in tactics designed to gain an edge over their rival, including cutting fees and offering lucrative referral bonuses.\n\nIt remains to be seen how the current dispute will be resolved, but it has already shown that the rivalry between Gemini and Genesis is more than just words and that customer service will be a key factor in deciding which company emerges victorious.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "London CNN Business \u2014\n\nGlobal fossil fuel emissions are expected to peak in 2025 as countries commit huge sums of money toward low-carbon fuels, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\nIn its annual World Energy Outlook report, published Thursday, the agency said that Russia\u2019s assault on Ukraine had the potential to \u201chasten\u201d the global transition to clean energy sources.\n\nThe IEA said it expects global investments in low-carbon energy to increase to $2 trillion a year until the end of the decade \u2014 up 50% from today\u2019s spending.\n\n\u201cEnergy markets and policies have changed as a result of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, not just for the time being, but for decades to come,\u201d Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, said in the report.\n\n\u201cGovernment responses around the world promise to make this a historic and definitive turning point towards a cleaner, more affordable and more secure energy system,\u201d he added.\n\nSince the war broke out in late February, many countries have shunned Russia\u2019s vast energy exports, finding new suppliers and ramping up imports of alternate energy sources.\n\nThat has put Moscow in a \u201cmuch-diminished position,\u201d the IEA said, and Russia is on course for its share of global energy exports drop to 13% by 2030 from 20% last year.\n\nEurope \u2014 Moscow\u2019s biggest customer for oil and gas \u2014 has borne the brunt of the energy crunch. Benchmark natural gas prices have shot up since the invasion, though have dropped steeply in recent weeks thanks to mild temperatures and the bloc\u2019s successful efforts to store gas for winter.\n\n\u201cRussia [has] lost this market forever. And it will be very difficult [for] this Russian oil and gas [to] find a new home as big as Europe, as lucrative as Europe,\u201d Birol told CNN\u2019s Julia Chatterley in an interview on Thursday.\n\nEarlier this week, Birol said that intense competition for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and cuts in oil output by OPEC and its allies had led to \u201cthe first truly global energy crisis,\u201d according to a Reuters.\n\nThursday\u2019s report will be welcomed by those who\u2019ve worried that the crisis has set the world\u2019s climate goals back.\n\nFears of energy shortages have led some countries in Europe and China to burn more coal this year. Hard coal power generation jumped nearly 15% between March and September in Europe in 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, according to the Independent Commodity Intelligence Services.\n\nOverall, though, growth in coal burning has been \u201cmuted\u201d this year, Birol told CNN.\n\nAnd, for the first time ever, the IEA\u2019s annual forecast sees demand for all fossil fuel to either peak or plateau. Oil is expected to be the last holdout, reaching a plateau by the mid-2030s, the report said.\n\n\u201cGovernments are putting real money on the table to accelerate the green energy [transition], not necessarily for environmental, climate reasons, but mainly for energy security reasons,\u201d Birol told CNN.\n\nDespite the flurry of clean energy investment, the agency said that it expects global temperatures to rise by 2.5 Celsius (4.5 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century \u2014 well above the 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) upper limit needed to avert severe consequences for the climate. The world has already warmed 1.2 degrees Celsius since the industrial revolution.\n\nGovernments will also need to raise their annual clean energy investments to $4 trillion by 2030 to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, the report said.\n\n\u201cThere is still a large gap between today\u2019s pledges and a stabilization of the rise in global temperatures around 1.5\u00b0C,\u201d the IEA warned.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "A UK mother has been penalized \u00a31,700 (approximately $2,300) after allegedly inquiring about her son's job prospects if she donated a portion of her liver to him.\n\nIn October 2020, the 53-year-old mother, whose identity remains undisclosed, contacted a liver transplant clinic in London to inquire about the possibility of her son being hired if she donated part of her liver to him.\n\nAt the time, her son had applied for multiple positions but was unsuccessful in all of them.\n\nThe transplant clinic promptly notified the Care Quality Commission (CQC), the UK's healthcare regulator, which discovered that she had breached patient confidentiality.\n\nThe regulator fined the mother \u00a31,700 for her actions, which reportedly included suggesting that her son could potentially receive preferential treatment.\n\nThis incident is the first of its kind in the UK and serves as a warning to others who might be tempted to take similar actions.\n\nThe CQC emphasized that the woman's actions were inappropriate, as they could have placed her son in a vulnerable position and put undue pressure on the transplant center.\n\nThe mother has since accepted the fine and apologized for her actions, stating that she was desperate to help her son find employment.\n\nIn a statement, the mother said: \"I understand why I've been fined and I accept it. I just wanted to help my son in his job search and thought if I donated part of my liver, it might make a difference. I realize now that it was wrong and I'm sorry.\"\n\nThis incident highlights the harsh realities of the UK job market and the lengths to which some individuals will go to secure employment.\n\nWhile it is commendable that the mother wanted to help her son, her actions were wrong and should not be repeated.\n\nIt is essential for individuals to remember that the CQC is in place to ensure patient safety and will take appropriate action if any breaches occur.\n\nThe CQC has urged employers to be aware of their obligations to potential employees and their rights when considering job applications.\n\nFurthermore, individuals should not put themselves in a vulnerable position by attempting to secure a job through unethical means.\n\nThe CQC is committed to ensuring that employers treat all applicants fairly and without discrimination, and encourages anyone who believes they have experienced such behavior to report it.\n\nThis incident has also emphasized the importance of understanding transplant ethics, which is crucial in ensuring that all transplant decisions are based on fairness and equality.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "It should be another good year for energy stocks, according to Goldman Sachs. The sector outperformed the S & P 500 by 78% in 2022, and while it is unlikely there will be a repeat of that magnitude, the backdrop is still constructive for energy equities, analyst Neil Mehta said in a note Tuesday. \"We see Brent in a multi-year $80-$100/b range (above the forward curve), the equities 'sweet spot' and see company-specific drivers around capital returns, project developments and execution to drive healthy upside/downside dispersion,\" he wrote. XLE 1Y mountain Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund's strong performance Goldman's bottom-up price targets imply 13% market cap weighted total return to the energy stocks it covers. The firm's buy-rated stocks have an implied 26% average total return. Investors should keep their eye on pullbacks in the space, Mehta said. There were three in both 2021 and 2022, and he said he would not be surprised if there is a similar frequency this year. \"That said, each pullback created an attractive entry point for investors who may have missed the early innings of the rally,\" he wrote. Of the stocks Goldman rates a buy, several have upside north of 40% to the firm's price targets. Here are 10 names on its buy list. The stocks with the highest total return are Antero Resources and Cheniere Energy , both at 48%, according to Goldman Sachs. Antero Resources gained a whopping 77% in 2022 and was down nearly 9% so far this year. Natural gas exporter Cheniere Energy gained nearly 28% in 2022, but so far is down around 5% since the start of the year. Cheniere was also named a top conviction pick for 2023 by UBS in December, thanks to its exposure to the undersupplied liquid natural gas industry. Meanwhile, energy services will offer the best earnings per share growth in 2023, Mehta said. In this space, he likes SLB , Halliburton and, especially, Baker Hughes . \"Given sharp performance, risk/reward looks particularly compelling for BKR from current levels as we move into 2023,\" he wrote. Baker Hughes gained nearly 23% last year. Among the supermajors, Mehta prefers Exxon Mobil and Conocophillips over Chevron . In an interview with CNBC's Brian Sullivan on Thursday, Mehta praised Conocophillips CEO Ryan Lance . He said under Lance's leadership, the company became more growth oriented, fixed its balance sheet and acquired Concho Resources in 2020. Conocophillips is now \"the best major in the world,\" Mehta said. Shares rallied 63% in 2022. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.", "label": "human"}

That is to say, rates are variable and can change multiple times per year at the whim of the Federal Reserve.\n\nIf the interest rate on your savings account changes significantly, you might decide to look at other financial institutions to see if you can find a more competitive interest rate elsewhere. However, bear in mind that changing accounts may not be worth the effort, particularly if your new account's rate drops afterward.\n\nYou also might consider other savings account options. For example, buying savings bonds or setting up a CD ladder may be worth considering if you've already established your emergency fund.\n\nTypical interest rates\n\nNationally, the average traditional savings account earns just 0.30% APY.\n\nIf you're more comfortable banking with a brick-and-mortar bank, a traditional savings account might be a better option for you. Just know that you may not be getting the best possible interest rate, because online banks and credit unions usually offer higher rates.\n\nSavings account basics\n\nA savings account is an interest-earning bank account. Accounts that are backed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) are secure. Up to $250,000 per owner is insured in these bank accounts.\n\nWhat to look for in a savings account\n\nWhen you're looking for a savings account, you'll want to read through the account disclosures and terms to review the account's minimum balance requirements and minimum opening deposits. The account disclosure may also specify any fees associated with the account, and whether there are any transaction limits.\n\nThe best savings account interest rates\n\nGenerally, you'll find the best savings interest rates at online banks. The best high-yield savings accounts offer 3.50% APY or more right now. Right now, UFB Direct offers the highest interest rate on our list. UFB Best Savings pays 4.11% (as of 12/14/2022) APY.\n\nSavings account fees\n\nDepending on where you bank, some savings accounts may charge monthly service fees. A monthly service fee is an amount you'll have to pay each month to maintain an account. Some accounts will allow you to waive a monthly service fee if you meet certain requirements while others cannot be waived.\n\nBear in mind, some savings accounts do not charge certain fees at all. For example, all the banks on our list do not charge any monthly service fees.\n\nHow savings accounts work\n\nA savings account is a type of interest-earning bank account. A savings account rate is variable, which means it can fluctuate after you've opened the account. Your bank will usually email you to tell you the rate will go up or down soon.\n\nSavings accounts may also have transfer limits, according to federal rule Regulation D. Generally, if a savings account has a transfer limit, this means that you'll only be permitted to make six transfers from the account each month. If you exceed the transfer limit, you will have to pay a fee for each additional transfer.\n\nThe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve has recently amended Regulation D, so banks may choose to suspend the monthly transfer limit so customers can make unlimited monthly transactions, or they could enforce a six-per-month limit.\n\nThe different types of savings accounts\n\nThere are six types of savings accounts: traditional savings accounts, high-yield savings accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit, cash management accounts, and specialty savings accounts. The best savings account for you may depend on your banking preference, goals, and when you'll need to access your money.\n\nA high-yield savings account, for example, is a strong choice if you're comfortable with banking digitally and want to earn a high interest rate.\n\nSavings account glossary\n\nBelow is an overview of all the terms you may need to know about savings accounts:\n\nAnnual Percentage Yield (APY): the rate of return you earn over a year on deposit accounts.\n\nthe rate of return you earn over a year on deposit accounts. FDIC insurance: If your bank says it's FDIC insured this means the money in your bank will be secure in the rare event a bank shuts down.

We understand that \"best\" is often subjective, so in addition to highlighting the clear benefits of a financial product or account \u2014 a high APY, for example \u2014 we outline the limitations, too. We spent hours comparing and contrasting the features and fine print of various products so you don't have to.\n\nMethodology: About our experts\n\nThere are a lot of high-yield savings accounts out there. Through our research, we've found that the best high-yield savings accounts are offered by banks with a strong online presence, robo-advisors, and other internet-only financial companies.\n\nEach week, we review high-yield savings accounts at nearly two dozen institutions to identify the strongest options. We also cross-reference our list against popular comparison sites like Bankrate and NerdWallet to make sure we don't miss a thing.\n\nWhile interest rates are an important aspect of any high-yield savings account, we also consider minimum deposits and balance requirements, transfer limitations, and any other standout features. Most importantly, we don't consider any high-yield savings accounts that impose monthly maintenance fees.\n\nWe consulted banking and financial planning experts to inform these picks and provide their advice on finding the best high-yield savings accounts for your needs.\n\nInsider\n\nHere's what they had to say about high-yield savings. (Some text may be lightly edited for clarity.)\n\nExpert advice on choosing the best high-yield savings account for you\n\nGenerally, what makes a high-yield savings account good or not good?\n\nRoger Ma, CFP:\n\n\"It might not be as seamless to get your money out of an online savings account as it is a brick-and-mortar, but you don't want to have so much friction where it's such a pain to get the money out when you need it.\"\n\nMykail James, CFEI:\n\n\"Anything with a fee is not a good high-yield savings account. Anything that restricts how much you can save is, to me, not very good. If I can't save more than $10,000 in this account, and then I have to move it over somewhere else \u2014 to me, that's not a really good savings account, because it's not really prepared to help me expand and grow, which is what a savings account is supposed to do. I also look at interest rates, definitely. I look to see when the interest is paid. Is it quarterly, or is it monthly? How often do they pay out interest, and what are the interest rate stipulations?\"\n\nHow should someone decide whether to put their money in a high-yield savings account, money market account, or CD?\n\nTania Brown, CFP:\n\n\"So I guess we'll start off with how much money you want to put in and ... the level of transactions you want to have. If you want to have any transactions, that automatically takes out CDs. Then you're stuck between the high-yield savings and the money market account.\"\n\nLaura Grace Tarpley, Personal Finance Insider:\n\n\"I would use a high-yield savings account or money market account for short-term goals or an emergency fund. You'll probably want to choose whichever has a higher rate, but money market accounts can be good for emergency savings because they often come with a debit card or paper checks, making it easy to access money quickly. Then use CDs for longer-term goals, like buying a home in a few years.\"\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nShould I have multiple savings accounts? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Savings accounts are free to open and to maintain, so there's no real downside to having more than one. In fact, experts often recommend assigning a savings account to a single goal \u2014 house, car, wedding \u2014 so it's always clear how much you have for a given goal, and you aren't tempted to use money meant for one goal to pay for another. Opening multiple accounts at the same bank means they'll always show up in the same place and require the same login credentials. Some banks offer products to mimic this setup without technically opening multiple accounts \u2014 Ally, for instance, offers savings \"buckets\" to keep your money straight. Remember that savings accounts are only one part of your overall financial portfolio. Checking accounts, brokerage accounts, retirement accounts, and college savings accounts all serve different and important purposes for your money.\n\nDo I have to pay taxes on interest earned from a savings account? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Yes, you have to pay taxes on the interest earned from a savings account. If you earn more than $10 in interest on your savings account, the bank holding your account will send you a Form 1099-T to include in your tax return. This is one reason why you shouldn't keep retirement savings in a savings account \u2014 IRAs and 401(k)s, accounts designated for retirement, are tax-advantaged and will help minimize taxes over time.\n\nHow do I withdraw money from my savings account? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Typically, you can withdraw money from your savings account by phone, in person (if your bank has physical locations), via ATM, or by cashier's check \u2014 but doing your transaction online is usually easier. Money kept in your savings account is considered to be easily accessible, or \"liquid,\" because it isn't invested in the market. That means you can move money more easily than you could from a brokerage account. To withdraw money from your savings account: Use your username and password to log into your bank's website or mobile app\n\nNavigate to \"transfers\" (menu options will vary between banks)\n\nSpecify which account you want to withdraw from, and the checking account where you want the money to go\n\nConfirm the transaction when prompted If your checking and savings accounts are at the same bank, it should transfer more quickly than if you're moving money between banks. If you're moving money between banks, expect it to take at least one business day. Remember that savings accounts are designed for saving, not spending, and some banks may charge a fee for too many withdrawals in a given time frame. The easiest way to make regular withdrawals is to move your money into an account that exists for this purpose, like a checking account. Or, if you expect to take money from savings regularly, consider a hybrid checking and savings account like the one offered by SoFi.\n\nCan I set up direct deposit for my savings account? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Yes, you can set up direct deposit to your savings account. You can typically have your paycheck, or a portion of your paycheck, deposited directly into savings, or you can set up recurring automatic deposits from checking into savings. To do this, you can call or visit a branch (if your bank has physical locations) or log into your bank's website or app.\n\nDoes the interest rate on my savings account change? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Yes, the interest rate on your savings account will most likely change. Interest rates on savings accounts are variable, meaning they can and will change regularly and without advance notice. These fluctuations are based on the federal funds rate, which is set by the Federal Reserve. Because interest rates are variable, it might seem tempting to open multiple accounts and shuffle your money between them according to which has the best interest rate at any given time. You're allowed to do this, but we don't recommend it simply because of the maintenance and attention it requires. You're just as well off choosing a high-yield savings account that meets your needs, setting up automatic deposits, and leaving it alone to grow over time.\n\nDoes my savings account help me build credit? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. No, your savings account doesn't help you build credit. Credit shows banks and lenders whether they can trust you to pay back a loan, based on your past behavior. You build credit by borrowing money and paying it back on time, whether that's money borrowed through a credit card, a personal loan, a student loan, a car loan, or a mortgage. The more positive borrowing behavior you demonstrate, the more your credit score should rise.\n\nDo I have enough savings? Chevron icon It indicates an expandable section or menu, or sometimes previous / next navigation options. Experts typically recommend having about three to six months' worth of expenses in a savings account as an emergency fund, to be used only in case of emergency like job loss or a medical event. This estimate varies based on individual factors (Is there another income in your household? Do you have significant debt?) but it's a good rule of thumb. However, \"enough\" savings will be different for everyone, depending on your goals, financial obligations, and life stage. Remember that retirement savings and any investments \u2014 important parts of your overall portfolio \u2014 will not be stored in a savings account.", "label": "human"}

In the wider Lake District national park area, demand dipped 5% compared to the same period, and in mid-Wales it fell 10%.\n\nZoopla defines \"demand\" as emailing or phoning an agent about a home for sale.\n\nIn April 2020, during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, 46.6% of people in employment did some work from home, according to the Office for National Statistics. That figure rose to 57.2% in London, and there was an exodus from bustling urban areas as people sought leafy towns and coastal villages instead.\n\n\"Since the pandemic began in spring 2020, buyers - freed from the daily office commute - have been casting their home-searching nets further afield,\" Zoopla's Executive Director of Research Richard Donnell said in a press release.\n\nMost people who started working from home during the coronavirus pandemic plan to work both at home and in an office going forward, according to the ONS data, and many companies have mandated a return to the workplace, which appears to have caused a pivot in the housing market.\n\n\"The dynamics that have shaped the housing market over the last 5 years are shifting. We expect affordable urban centres to fare better than average in 2023,\" Donnell said.\n\nThe cost-of-living crisis has also contributed to the shift. Apartments are cheaper to run from an energy perspective, and on average, U.K. houses are more than twice the price of an apartment \u2014 the highest in 20 years, according to Zoopla.\n\nUrban areas also tend to offer more employment opportunities.\n\nA tricky environment for buyers\n\nThe Bank of England raised its interest rate to 3.5% on Dec. 15, pushing up borrowing costs for homebuyers. Both two- and five-year fixed mortgage rates have increased by more than 3% during 2022, according to Moneyfacts.co.uk.\n\nThe U.K. mortgage market fell into crisis in September following drastic policy shifts by then-Finance Minister Kwasi Kwarteng.

{"text": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) questions Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chairman Powell during a Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee hearing on the CARES Act, at the Hart Senate Office Building in Washington, DC, U.S., September 28, 2021.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote to the chair of Tesla's board, Robyn Denholm, expressing concern that CEO Elon Musk has possibly violated his legal duties to Tesla since he bought Twitter for $44 billion and that the board has failed in its duties to protect the company by not reining him in.\n\n\"[E]very Board of Directors of a company with multiple shareholders \u2013 especially publicly traded companies \u2013 is responsible for ensuring that a controlling shareholder (especially one who is also a Chief Executive Officer, or CEO) does not treat the company as a private plaything,\" Warren wrote in a letter on Sunday.\n\nThe lawmaker, who has sparred with Musk in the past over the idea of a wealth tax, asked the board to answer specific questions about the alleged misappropriation of Tesla resources and conflicts of interest resulting from Musk's purchase of Twitter.\n\nWarren charged that Musk's new ownership of the social media platform has \"raised questions about possible violations of securities or other laws, including whether Mr. Musk is funneling Tesla resources into Twitter, a potentially 'improper diversion of resources that might impact Tesla's sales and earnings' and could result in 'delays in programs at Tesla.'\"\n\nWarren cited CNBC reporting that Musk had pulled Tesla employees to help in his takeover of the platform, warning those arrangements may run afoul of state and federal labor laws.\n\n\"This use of Tesla employees raises obvious questions about whether Mr. Musk is appropriating resources from a publicly traded firm, Tesla, to benefit his own private company, Twitter,\" Warren wrote, adding that it could violate Musk's \"legal duty of loyalty to Tesla.\" She also suggested the arrangements could violate legal requirements to make public any employment agreements with executive officers, which Warren said Tesla has not done.\n\nMusk's ownership of Twitter creates \"unavoidable conflicts of interest,\" according to Warren.\n\nBecause Twitter relies on advertising revenue from other automobile companies that compete with Tesla, she wrote, Musk may be incentivized as the owner of Twitter to maximize revenue in its advertising deals with those Tesla rivals. But Musk could also choose to go the opposite route, Warren said, running Twitter to benefit Tesla by tweaking the algorithms to promote praise of Tesla products, giving the company free advertising or making it more difficult for competitors to reach potential customers on the platform.\n\nWarren added that the debt Musk took on to buy Twitter could also create conflicts, such as incentivizing him to have Tesla overpay for Twitter advertising to infuse it with cash.\n\nHate speech on Twitter could also damage Tesla's brand, Warren warned.\n\nShe accused Tesla's board of failing to take action to protect the company as its stock fell sharply after Musk's purchase of Twitter while other automakers have outperformed Tesla. Though she acknowledged not all the losses could be attributed to the Twitter purchase, \"there appears to be a direct link,\" she said.\n\nWarren asked Denholm to respond by Jan. 3 about the oversight the board will impose on Musk to ensure he meets his fiduciary duties at Tesla, how it's protecting from conflicts of interest, what sort of formal agreements are in place between the two companies and more.\n\nMusk and his lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSubscribe to CNBC on YouTube.\n\nWATCH: Twitter is now Elon Musk's company \u2014 Here's how experts responded to the news", "label": "human"}

{"text": "A forthcoming year of considerable digital health sector consolidation is anticipated by a prominent private-equity investor, as venture capital investment in start-ups continues to expand exponentially. \n\nThe digital health sector has witnessed remarkable growth, with venture capital investment totaling $12.2 billion in 2019, increasing to $17.6 billion in 2020. Experts predict that this figure could reach $20 billion in 2021. \n\nHowever, the global economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic may force digital health companies to explore alternative funding sources and exit strategies, such as mergers and acquisitions (M&A). \n\nWarburg Pincus Managing Director and Chief Investment Officer Kate Askew believes that M&A activity in the digital health sector could reach unprecedented levels in 2021. \n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of digital health services, making companies in this space more attractive to strategic buyers. Askew anticipates a significant wave of M&A driven by corporate players and traditional private equity firms. \n\nHigh valuations commanded by digital health companies could lead to more M&A activity as companies seek to maximize their investments. The crowded market of digital health companies, many of which command large valuations, may prompt consolidation in the coming year. \n\nThe pandemic has increased consumer comfort with digital health services, which could spur even more M&A activity in 2021. As more digital health services enter the market, companies will look for ways to differentiate themselves, potentially through acquisitions. \n\nThe recession could also lead to an uptick in M&A activity, as companies seek to bolster their balance sheets and cut costs. When looking to cut costs and preserve cash, companies may opt for consolidation, including acquisitions or process streamlining. \n\nThe digital health sector is undergoing a significant transformation, and M&A activity could be a major driver of this change.

{"text": "The upcoming changes to retirement savings accounts, particularly 401(k)s, are expected to bring significant relief to individuals and employers alike, as the Biden administration and congressional Democrats work to address the pandemic-driven recession.\n\nThese proposed changes aim to expand access to retirement savings accounts, incentivize employers to offer them, and provide tax breaks for savers. Specifically, the plan includes measures to increase the maximum age for contributions, allow automatic enrollment, and offer tax credits for employers who participate.\n\nThe expanded access to 401(k)s could benefit low- and middle-income savers, who often struggle to save for retirement. The plan also proposes increasing the maximum age for deducting retirement contributions, allowing savers to contribute more to their accounts, and increasing tax credits for low- and middle-income savers.\n\nIn addition, the plan aims to promote employer-sponsored retirement plans by increasing tax credits for employers and allowing them to deduct contributions. This could encourage more employers to offer 401(k)s as an employee benefit, attracting top talent and benefiting both employees and employers.\n\nThe proposed changes also include more flexible retirement withdrawals, allowing individuals to withdraw up to $10,000 from their retirement savings accounts without penalty. This could make it easier for people to access their retirement funds for certain expenses, such as buying a home or starting a business.\n\nUltimately, the proposed changes to retirement savings accounts aim to make it easier and more accessible for individuals to save for retirement, while also benefiting employers who offer these plans as an employee benefit.", "label": "machine"}
